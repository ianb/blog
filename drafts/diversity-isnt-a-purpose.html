        <div class="entry-content"><p>After <a href="">Christie Kohler&#8217;s tweetstorm</a>, the discussion of diversity at Mozilla has been rebooted.  We have a diversity initiative in the works.  I don&#8217;t mean to be too critical here, this is a normal response.  But I worry it gives Mozilla an out.  (In whatever form it takes, I do sincerely hope it is&nbsp;effective.)</p>
<p>An Organization has a purpose, and the purpose is never the diversity of the organization itself.  Successful work in the organization supports the organization&#8217;s purpose.  I offer this descriptively, not prescriptively.  Work that is disconnected from the organization&#8217;s purpose <em>exists</em>, may even be common, but it&#8217;s not successful, it doesn&#8217;t stick.  And Christie helped remind us of work Mozilla had forgotten to do&#8230; but that we <em>could</em> forget to do that work is a structural issue that reminders can&#8217;t&nbsp;fix.</p>
<p>Of course a large portion of an organization <em>supports</em> the purpose of the organization, even if it is not directly engaged in the purpose.  Someone has to do payroll, and in fact it&#8217;s very important that the checks go out, but unless the organization has strayed badly making payroll is not the organization&#8217;s purpose.  That paycheck does help keep everyone else&#8217;s attention on the purpose!  And diversity can act in a supporting role, alleviating some sense of guilt, maybe help keep people happy.  But that&#8217;s not an inspiring reason to pursue&nbsp;diversity.</p>
<p>Where diversity can impact purpose is that a more diverse set of people can add more perspectives, can improve the culture and make everyone more effective, can open up the organization to the contributions of potentially high-impact individuals who might otherwise be excluded or simply uninterested in the organization.  If you believe diversity isn&#8217;t just an obligation, but is an opportunity for the organization, then it becomes clearer how important it is to have diversity in the teams and leadership that are <em>directly focused on the purpose of the organization</em>.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m starting to think if you want to run a diversity initiative you should probably staff it with people from the mainstream of the organization.  People who are part of the outgroup – the outgroup that we don&#8217;t want to be the outgroup – should be kept on or directed towards the organization&#8217;s central&nbsp;purpose.</p>
<p>In practice I don&#8217;t see this happening often at Mozilla.  Diversity initiatives aside, I see people from outgroups drift to the periphery.  It doesn&#8217;t feel good to be on the periphery, so then they leave.  We talk about hiring pipelines, but a we need a credible career pipeline after&nbsp;hiring.</p>
<p>The drift isn&#8217;t just managerial inattention.  The organization&#8217;s core has a different culture than its periphery.  At least Mozilla&#8217;s, perhaps everywhere?  The core is built more on relationships and informal authority.  The work involves more negotiation.  Competent supporting functions can be understood and formalized and operated on with some predictability.  Competitive work involves more unknowns, and that changes the nature of the work.  Amidst this ambiguity there is more room for bias, including the self-deprecating bias members of the outgroup may hold against themselves.  For what is imposter syndrome but our own unfair biases and stereotypes applied&nbsp;inward?</p>
<p>Now I feel like I&#8217;ve talked myself into a corner.  Is it hopeless?  But analysis <em>should</em> identify this as a hard problem; easy problems get&nbsp;fixed.</p>
<p>To be frank, when I first tried to describe the cultural difference of Mozilla&#8217;s core the term <em>asshole empowerment</em> came to mind, even if it&#8217;s not a description that personally resonates.  <em>Just get rid of the assholes</em> has become a kind of trope of these discussions, especially discussions that have to fit in 140 characters.  (Please please don&#8217;t discuss this post on Twitter.  Please.)  I&#8217;m unhappy with this approach.  There&#8217;s more traction in focusing on behavior than personal qualities.  But more strategically it&#8217;s not a good battle to set up: on one side obligation and guilt, and on the other the people who currently do the most important work.  Some of those people worked hard against their personal inclinations to adopt to that culture!  I think you might find more widespread discomfort and more allies for change than you&#8217;d expect from the&nbsp;outside.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t have an answer to how that core culture can be more inclusive.  I&#8217;m pretty sure the change has to come from within.  I&#8217;ve seen suggestions that would formalize more process, bureaucratize more interactions, empower roles up and down over relationships.  Maybe you could call it taking the &#8220;club&#8221; out of the &#8220;boys&#8217; club&#8221;.  And I don&#8217;t buy that it would work.  In a <a href="">thread</a> I saw: &#8220;every flat organization contains an underspecified bug-ridden form of a traditional management structure&#8221; countered with: &#8220;every formal organizational structure is a mis-specified bug-ridden representation of the actual management structure.&#8221;  Some domains are intrinsically complex, approachable only iteratively.  And so is the struggle to satisfy an organization&#8217;s&nbsp;purpose.</p>
<p>Disconnected from an&nbsp;organization&#8217;s</p>
<p>One thing that often comes up – and I don&#8217;t mean to be especially critical of Mozilla here, as I think this happens everywhere – is the &#8220;diversity initiative&#8221;.  The positive part of a diversity initiative is that an explicit structure means we won&#8217;t forget to keep working on this.  And in the midst of other stuff going on at Mozilla we have periodically&nbsp;&#8220;forgotten&#8221;.</p>
<p>But an initiative also implies a partitioning.  Partitioning <a href="">can be great</a> for some things, but not&nbsp;this.</p>
<p>Organizations exist for reasons.  Mozilla has a <a href="">mission</a>, but more specifically it has a <a href="">product</a> that is how it advances that mission, and Mozilla has a place in the world where it is most likely to be effective.  Diversity isn&#8217;t the reason an organization&nbsp;exists.</p>
<p>Why do we want diversity in our organizations?  To perform better.  To be able to speak more widely.  To help the individuals of the organization feel good about the organization.  Except for the last case, it&#8217;s not sufficient to just have a diversity of people present, the organization has to <em>do</em> something with those people, those people have to do what the organization&nbsp;does.</p>
<p>I think everyone basically understands that some diversity counts more than other&nbsp;diversity.  </p></div>
