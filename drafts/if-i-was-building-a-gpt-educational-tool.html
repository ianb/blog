        <div class="entry-content"><p>There&#8217;s lots of talk about ChatGPT and education. Lots of that talk is worrying about cheating, which I understand, but isn&#8217;t very fun. Much more fun is to&nbsp;think:</p>
<p><strong>How can Large Language Models like <span class="caps">GPT</span> be positively applied to&nbsp;education?</strong></p>
<p>If I was going to tackle that (and yes, I&#8217;d like that opportunity, but no, I have no specific plans) these are some of the thoughts about how I&#8217;d want to go about&nbsp;it:</p>
<ol>
<li>The primary focus should start with pedagogy and it should stay with pedagogy.<ol>
<li>Not business cases, not assessment, not plagiarism detection, not portfolios, not&nbsp;abuse.</li>
<li>Some of these things will need to be addressed <em>in the service of a focus on pedagogy</em>.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Think seriously about the medium of communication:<ol>
<li>You can type at ChatGPT and it will respond. This is a very reasonable starting&nbsp;point.</li>
<li>The tool should be available and accessible at the moment that it&#8217;s needed. I&#8217;m not sure what that moment is (another point of investigation), but typing into chat may not be the right thing at that&nbsp;moment.</li>
<li>Younger children are slow typers and may not be literate enough to make good use of it. Voice is an obvious alternative. (But maybe not the only&nbsp;alternative.)</li>
<li>Voice is pretty awkward to use in the classroom. But it&#8217;s worth&nbsp;investigating.</li>
<li>Output doesn&#8217;t just have to be text. ChatGPT has Markdown output, but I believe more is possible, possibly with complementary systems or compound interactions that create richer output.<ol>
<li>As an example if you ask ChatGPT to solve an algebra problem step by step, it will do so. You could change its narrative response into something&nbsp;animated.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>ChatGPT is pretty good at multiple choice. It can offer next steps while also allowing you to choose something off the&nbsp;list.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>I&#8217;m not very worried about accuracy:<ol>
<li>Creating domains of instruction makes it clearer how to keep it&nbsp;informed.</li>
<li>With things like math problems it often gets the approach correct but the arithmetic wrong. Let kids be critical. Don&#8217;t make it an assessment tool! You can take &#8220;answers&#8221; out entirely when that&#8217;s appropriate and only let it discuss&nbsp;approaches.</li>
<li>Building this stuff takes time, and <span class="caps">GPT</span> (or other models) will get better while that&#8217;s&nbsp;happening.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Students need structure and framing:<ol>
<li>It&#8217;s okay to just jam with ChatGPT and find stuff out. That&#8217;s how everyone uses it today, it&#8217;s driven by curiosity or purpose and when those are exhausted then you take a break. This should be&nbsp;available.</li>
<li>But that&#8217;s not enough for a classroom setting or for educational purposes. It would be cool if every student was naturally self-motivated and driven toward goals, but that&#8217;s not a real thing. The students aren&#8217;t flawed just because they aren&#8217;t&nbsp;self-directed.</li>
<li>ChatGPT should be an ally of the teacher and the curriculum. Teachers should be able to share their plans and goals with ChatGPT and have it make use of that.<ol>
<li>The same techniques ChatGPT uses to avoid offering opinions, brainstorm bullying, or do other things it can&#8217;t or shouldn&#8217;t do, can be applied to classroom&nbsp;direction.</li>
<li>Without classroom management you don&#8217;t get to teach. This is also true for classroom&nbsp;tools.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Education happens best in a community:<ol>
<li>The tool should be naturally social, with the ability to share in the classroom&nbsp;community.</li>
<li>It may be better to err on the side of transparency in the classroom. This mitigates some abuse, and feels like a good&nbsp;default.</li>
<li>Sharing excitement is great, and being excited about the classroom work helps motivate keeping on&nbsp;task.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>The tool should be contextually aware and responsive:<ol>
<li>This might be an opportunity to think about those same ideas about communication: some of the communication isn&#8217;t asking a question, but being present to watch other work that&#8217;s going&nbsp;on.</li>
<li>Like spell check or grammar checking, it shouldn&#8217;t go in and fix things directly. It can give very direct feedback and exact changes, but by making the student apply those changes it keeps them in the driver&#8217;s seat and aware of the changes.<ol>
<li>But a Socratic approach might also be appropriate, and seems feasible: have it phrase its critique as&nbsp;questions.</li>
<li>And the student should be empowered to ignore these critiques: the <span class="caps">AI</span> is not in charge! The <span class="caps">AI</span>&#8217;s lack of ego is a&nbsp;feature.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>This is all most accessible on a computer. I don&#8217;t like the idea of forcing all work onto a computer. <span class="caps">OCR</span> of kids&#8217; handwriting is a non-starter. Maybe having them read out their work to the computer is reasonable in some&nbsp;cases.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>I&#8217;m concerned about isolation&#8230;<ol>
<li>Computers are naturally isolated. A class full of students using computers doesn&#8217;t have the energy and aliveness of other&nbsp;activities.</li>
<li>Maybe it shouldn&#8217;t be a personal-computer-mediated tool. Alexa is an example of a communal tool. It&#8217;s exact interaction style isn&#8217;t right for a class, but it&#8217;s not hopeless to imagine other form&nbsp;factors.</li>
<li>Mostly I don&#8217;t know, but it&#8217;s worth continuing to think&nbsp;about.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>There will likely be multiple entities:<ol>
<li>If ChatGPT is an entity but not an assessment tool&#8230; there still will be assessment&nbsp;tools.</li>
<li>Things like visualizations are best seen as complementary&nbsp;tools.</li>
<li><span class="caps">GPT</span> and identity is&#8230; weird. A singular identity is something you create, not a built-in aspect of&nbsp;it.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>This is all very outcome-focused. This may be getting ahead, there&#8217;s also a question of&nbsp;process:</p>
