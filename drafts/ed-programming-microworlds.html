        <div class="entry-content"><p>There&#8217;s a lot of debate about whether everyone in the next generation should learn to code, and if so why (<a href="https://www.chris-granger.com/2015/01/26/coding-is-not-the-new-literacy/">for example</a>). And though I have a personal attachment to the educational value of programming, I also get it: we don&#8217;t need to turn kids into little workers, programming isn&#8217;t for everyone, and and there&#8217;s some weird futurist fetish behind the drive to teach&nbsp;programming.</p>
<p>But programming is also unique: you tell the computer what to do and it does it faithfully. It&#8217;s not like a graded essay where you are trying to satisfy someone else. No one else has to evaluate your work, and instead of trying to replicate the expected result you can generate truly new&nbsp;results.</p>
<p>One thing I liked from the book <a href="https://mindstorms.media.mit.edu/">Mindstorms</a> (the freely-available book) was the concept of <a href="http://edutechwiki.unige.ch/en/Microworld">Microworlds</a>. (Both names have since been turned into product names, but seemingly unrelated to the actual&nbsp;ideas.)</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turtle_graphics">Turtle graphics</a> is one Microworld, specifically based around geometry. Hence its relatively novel use of angles and lengths instead of&nbsp;coordinates.</p>
<p>Each world gives people something to explore. That they do it programmatically is interesting, and allows for different kinds of exploration, but it&#8217;s the world they are exploring, not the&nbsp;code.</p>
<p>Mindstorms hints at the idea that there should be many such microworlds. Maybe they all use Logo, or maybe&nbsp;not.</p>
<p>What didn&#8217;t happen is all those other Microworlds in Logo. But some have come along: Processing (https://processing.org/) is one example. And I think it&#8217;s notable that &#8220;Processing&#8221;, the graphical approach, is treated separately from any particular language implementation; <a href="">Processing.js</a> is another valid implementation of the same&nbsp;microworld.</p>
<p>But there could be many more! And I think it&#8217;s much more interesting than yet another puzzle-based block programming language to teach&nbsp;coding.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Choose Your Own Adventure approaches to nonlinear fiction, which starts without any programming but easily opens up into all sorts of other complexity. <a href="http://twinery.org/">Twinery</a> is a good implementation. The first thing you teach isn&#8217;t what a variable is; the first thing you teach is how to tell a story, then how to tell a story that collaborates with the reader, then maybe how to use programming to make the story itself&nbsp;autonomous.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Music generation. <a href="https://foxdot.org/">FoxDot</a> (itself based on <a href="https://supercollider.github.io/">SuperCollider</a>) is somewhat accessible. The first concepts here are signatures and beats and intervals, and later programming comes in with naming and sequencing of&nbsp;operations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lots to be done with procedural generation. Something as simple as cartoon face generation is an easy start (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernoff_face">for example</a>). Some of the fun is being able to do <em>some</em> things easily, but digging into the underlying code to add new parameters or change the way things work. But starting at the beginning (<a href="https://happycoding.io/tutorials/processing/creating-variables">like with variables</a>) hides the fun and interesting part behind graphics&nbsp;coding.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Simulators can teach a domain (city design, ecology, electoral politics, etc), but like procedural generation adding some programming can make the exploration more exciting. <a href="https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/">NetLogo</a> explores this&nbsp;area.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.masswerk.at/elizabot/">Eliza</a>, in her original implementation, is like a very <a href="http://chayden.net/eliza/instructions.txt">simple programming language</a> for interaction. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Person-centered_therapy">Rogerian psychotherapy</a> stance that makes Eliza plausible is reminiscent of how a teacher might interact with a student, and I can imagine a child implementing a &#8220;teacher&#8221;&nbsp;chatbot.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Quiz generation. Writing a program that creates a math worksheet seems like automating educational tedium, but I think a lot of kids would find it both interesting and&nbsp;satisfying.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>I&#8217;ve put in examples of all these things, so in a sense this all exists. But they usually lack appropriate introductions and humane environments designed to work for children. Often they put the programming environment first, instead of situating programming in an environment that has its own educational&nbsp;value.</p></div>
