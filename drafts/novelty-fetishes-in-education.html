        <div class="entry-content"><p>When looking naively at Waldorf and Montessori education, it is easy to get the impression they are very similar and that they concentrate on creativity.  Because you see these children, and they are doing things that are very different from what did, they are coming up with things you never came up with.  Looking only at a single child&#8217;s experience it&#8217;s very hard to tell the difference between novelty and creativity.  You can&#8217;t tell <em>whose</em> creativity it&nbsp;is.</p>
<p>As a result I don&#8217;t think most people get Waldorf or Montessori at all from the outside.  But then you <em>can</em> really know these educational philosophies, and it can tell you about much more than just those two philosophies: it gives you breadth to think about dimensions of education you can&#8217;t even think about when you think about only one system.  (I was listening to the beginning of Alan Watt&#8217;s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWWYbWF9TGE">Seeing Through The Net</a>.)  These different systems tell you about choices you never considered (but still were making), relationships with children you haven&#8217;t considered, ideas about where knowledge comes from&#8230; you can triangulate on education, even if you don&#8217;t adopt either of these other philosophies, even if you are committed to your &#8220;home team&#8221;, you tradition, the institution you are committed to, the community you are committed to – there are a tremendous number of valid reasons to align yourself around something other than educational ideology, it does not require you to admonish ideology to justify these multiple paths of influence.  So many parents are frustrated to feel they must chase social signaling, <a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=min%2Fmax">minmax</a>&#8216;d education choices&#8230; and while you can put effort into justifying your positive path, it&#8217;s easier to denigrate the path you are avoiding.  So they choose a perspective where ideology does not make a difference, instead of saying why the value they are pursuing is a better one than ideology.  But I&#8217;m not really judging – I entirely believe that there are other values to pursue!  These people may well be making choice that is correct by intuition, and that they cannot articulate the reason does not invalidate the reason that exists.  (Can a reason exist that is not articulated?  But of course!  Are we such gods that the universe does not exist where we cannot gaze on it, that turning our heads aniliates half the world?  Is reason a product of our perception, or does it exist and we simply perceive&nbsp;it?)</p>
<p>But triangulation&#8230; I realize this is how I&#8217;ve been drawn to eastern religions.  I&#8217;m not looking to shop around; I&#8217;m probably not going to buy <em>any</em> of it, and I&#8217;m comfortable with that.  But wherever I am, I need these other points to know where that is.  But it&#8217;s so easy when feeling that curious tug that you can mistake your appreciation of novelty with a belonging to the religion itself. It&#8217;s so creative and open!  But who is it open to?  To <em>you</em>?  Or to the man behind the curtain, the one who <em>finished</em> the story, because they almost all say that the story is <em>done</em>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_revelation">no changes allowed</a>.</p>
<p>And they almost all do this, but some of the eastern religions did not, some of them maintained a curiousness.  And there&#8217;s a lot of depth in that history, in all those people <em>thinking</em> in a way that <em>mattered</em>, that was still alive.  But I don&#8217;t know&#8230; maybe I&#8217;m still a fan of the home team, nevermind if they are the&nbsp;best.</p></div>
