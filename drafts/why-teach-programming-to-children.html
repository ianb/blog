        <div class="entry-content"><p>There&#8217;s a new push now to teach programming to children, with a ton of sites to teach these skills, and <a href="http://code.org/">big initiatives</a>. And then there&#8217;s some pushback: why do we think teaching programming to children is useful?  As a vocational skill?  So they can make apps? Become the next Mark&nbsp;Zuckerberg?</p>
<p>I learned <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logo_%28programming_language%29">Logo</a> when I was young, and have at various times played with the language and the principles behind it, perhaps best articulated in the book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Mindstorms-Children-Computers-Powerful-Ideas/dp/0465046746">Mindstorms</a>. There&#8217;s something in the principles of Logo that feels like it has never properly escaped the <span class="caps">MIT</span> Media Lab, and unfortunately seems to have little influence on this burst of interest in teaching&nbsp;programming.</p>
<p>As <a href="http://worrydream.com/MeanwhileAtCodeOrg/">Bret Victor pointed out</a> this idea of programming as a platform for learning in general seems lost.  Perhaps this is because those ideas went hand-in-hand with ideas of progressive education that are also not well represented in the national discussion of our day.  Despite the intense interest in educational outcomes, there&#8217;s little discussion about how children actually learn, and less about how children learn <em>best</em> (perhaps driven by metrics that are only setup to measure the proportion of children who are <em>good enough</em>).</p>
<p>I think the reason to teach children programming is not to make them programmers, but because there is incredible potential to use the act of programming to let children assimilate complex and important ideas in a way that traditional instruction does not do well&nbsp;at.</p>
<p>Programming has certain&nbsp;features:</p>
<ol>
<li>Programming languages are highly <strong>formalized and precise</strong>.</li>
<li>Computer environments <strong>do not judge</strong>.  They simply&nbsp;perform.</li>
<li>The computer <strong>patiently verifies</strong> any&nbsp;program.</li>
<li>Programming allows <strong>many kinds of abstractions</strong>.</li>
<li>The programmer can <strong>create new abstractions</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p>What kinds of things can we teach through this&nbsp;medium?</p>
<h3>Discipline and&nbsp;precision</h3>
<p>Programming is at times frustrating.  Every character matters. Characters you didn&#8217;t even know matter, still matter.  Everything must be <em>exactly right</em>.</p>
<p>Learning to successfully program, or more modestly just to get beyond the frustration of programming, you have to work in a precise manner. You have to type what you intended to type, you have to read what you&#8217;ve done, you have to separate what you <em>intended</em> from what you <em>actually wrote</em> and compare the two.  All the while you must accept that the computer wants what it wants, and will listen to no arguments about what it <em>should</em>&nbsp;do.</p>
<p>This is learning about discipline, not so much learning about thinking.  But it&#8217;s one of the skills you learn from studying mathematics that we do not put forward as a top-level skill, but should.  It&#8217;s similar to the skill of a lawyer reading a contract, or a carpenter planning a project.  Sometimes you have to do everything <em>just right</em>, and precision as a general skill can be&nbsp;learned.</p>
<h3>Internal (as opposed to external)&nbsp;validation</h3>
<p>In most areas of education we ask children to seek external validation: the grade the teacher assigns, the feedback given, the direction given.  Even with something as objective as math we often make the students show their work, because it&#8217;s not enough to get the right answer, you must come to the right answer in an acceptable&nbsp;way.</p>
<p>Computers themselves don&#8217;t really want you do anything in particular. They are passive, they accept whatever instructions you give them, and then execute those instructions.  Maybe you gave them instructions that don&#8217;t accomplish what you wanted, but the computer doesn&#8217;t&nbsp;care.</p>
<p>What you do with a computer is up to you.  Programming is not a test, lends itself poorly to testing.  Even if you have an assigned task, completing that means reaching a bunch of intermediate steps of your own&nbsp;design.</p>
<h3>Learning by experimenting with&nbsp;ideas</h3>
<p>While the computer can&#8217;t validate you emotionally, it can tell you if did what you intended.  Over and over, patiently, and without asking you what you are trying to get at.  If you need to be coaxed it can be hard, sometimes you can&#8217;t even tell if you are making progress.  But if you want to ask &#8220;what if&#8221; then it&#8217;s perfect.  And &#8220;what if&#8221; is the way to learn many&nbsp;things.</p></div>
