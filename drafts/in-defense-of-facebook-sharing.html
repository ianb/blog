        <div class="entry-content"><p>About the positive parts about sharing family and memories on&nbsp;Facebook</p>
<p>Comment:&nbsp;https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=17921895</p>
<p>I&#8217;m fairly similar. It&#8217;s become a way to save and share family photos and&nbsp;stories.</p>
<p>That said, I find real value in that. I know what I share and save on Facebook is going to be there in 10 years, and probably will still be somewhere accessible in 50 years. Everyone pretends personal systems (where you are &#8220;in control&#8221;) are safer, but I know how many photos and files I&#8217;ve misplaced over the&nbsp;years.</p>
<p>And Facebook encourages me to do more than just post blind photos, but also to give a story. I&#8217;ve looked through old photo albums, and the pictures become empty all too quickly. I could do all this on my own, but again I&#8217;ll probably lose things or the stories and photos will become disassociated or some other mistake, or I&#8217;ll be gone and no one will know or care to retrieve them from whatever system I&#8217;ve created. But even more so I need a reason to put everything together, and sharing it immediately with other people – people who show, even trivially, that they care – gives me a&nbsp;reason.</p>
<p>Facebook&#8217;s Memories feature has already shown me that this is important – seeing something I shared one or five or ten years ago makes me realize these things matter to&nbsp;me.</p>
<p>Maybe other people have ways of doing disciplined documentation of their life and experiences and family that I don&#8217;t. But I&#8217;m&nbsp;doubtful.</p>
<hr>
<p>I&#8217;ve been thinking a bit more about how Facebook is different from Twitter (and so far Google+ is like&nbsp;Twitter):</p>
<p>The quintessential use of Facebook is to tell the story of your life. And, in turn, to read the stories of your friends. There&#8217;s cute links, calls to action, etc; but the core of it is a personal story. The much-ridiculed I am in line for a latte update even makes some sense in this context&#8230; it&#8217;s just not very good storytelling. And on Facebook that&#8217;s okay; you aren&#8217;t reading for the quality of the story, you are reading because of the quality of your relationship with your friends, and the stories build on that. Twitter of course is entirely different, it&#8217;s clever, it&#8217;s entertaining, when it&#8217;s not you unfollow a person, and even when it&#8217;s built on personal connections it&#8217;s more like friends hanging out and talking shit than personal&nbsp;communication.</p>
<p>I saw a discussion a while back about people&#8217;s opinions about posting pictures of their babies and children. There were some people advocating that you just host them yourself, easy to keep them private, you retain control, etc. But I know how that ends up, you get a crapload of photos in a giant bucket. If you want to archive images of a person then it&#8217;s a great way to go; but no one cares about image archives. Posting on Facebook (when done somewhat thoughtfully) is far superior. You are encouraged to add commentary to the photo, and to continue that commentary as people comment. You get feedback when people want more of the same (&#8220;Like&#8221;). There&#8217;s something live about it; like the difference between live radio and a podcast, it gives a real sense of &#8220;now&#8221;, something in which people who feel close to you but are physically far away can find&nbsp;comfort.</p>
<p>I think Facebook is far less trivial than it is made out to be. It is full of trivial things, but they are the trivial things that make up our lives; if you are just a tourist then it will feel banal, but if so then you are missing the much larger and longer stories that make it worth it. Facebook is weirdly both a short and long attention span&nbsp;medium.</p>
<hr>
<p>Twitter is for introverts, Facebook is for extroverts, G+ has yet to be&nbsp;seen.</p>
<p>This is ironic, because Twitter was made by extroverts, Facebook by introverts. I think there is a sort of dispassionate intuition we can have about&nbsp;people-who-are-not-ourselves.</p>
<p>This might seem counterintuitive because Twitter is for celebrities, and Facebook for people who are private about their lives. But to phrase it another way: Twitter is for people who don&#8217;t care who knows about what they have to say or think, and Facebook is for people who want to develop symmetric relationships. Extroverts are vulnerable to each individual, while introverts only see the&nbsp;aggregate.</p></div>
