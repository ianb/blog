        <div class="entry-content"><h1>A proposed development approach for contextual&nbsp;recommendation</h1>
<p>I want to distinguish <em>contextual recommendation</em> from New Tab recommendations: a contextual recommendation asks: how can Firefox help you <em>here</em>, on the page you are on.  Some things that make this&nbsp;different:</p>
<ol>
<li>The user does not necessarily <em>want</em> to do anything new, they might be happy doing exactly what they are&nbsp;doing.</li>
<li>The user does not necessarily know what they want to do&nbsp;next.</li>
<li>Imagine the moment <em>before</em> you focus on the <span class="caps">URL</span> bar and enter something, the moment before you create a new tab to do a new task.  There is a yet-undetermined readiness, a moment to positively engage the user in a different&nbsp;pattern.</li>
<li>Imagine the moment when you know there is something you <em>should</em> do, somewhere you <em>should</em> go, and then instead you go to facebook.com or some other&nbsp;distraction.</li>
</ol>
<p>Really we&#8217;re on new ground here: major internet properties are built as a distraction engine, and if we want to do something different than be a Better Distraction Enabler we have to figure out what it is we&#8217;re even trying to do.  (There&#8217;s a product question here too: do we imagine ourselves the Fox News of browsers, creating material that pulls you through the commercial to the next item; or do we imagine ourselves the Public Radio of browsers, where the material is intended to make you feel good about your experience <em>after</em> you&#8217;ve completed the&nbsp;experience.)</p>
<h2>Start with&nbsp;history</h2>
<p>The best corpus we have for these activities already exists in browser history.  My personal Places history has about 100,000 URLs.  This list is of course biased towards my own activity, but it&#8217;s fairly easy to pluralize that bias with just a handful of contributing developers.  If we build off some other set we&#8217;ve introduced a bias that isn&#8217;t rooted in even <em>one</em> person.  Hand-wavy use cases are highly biased, usually towards &#8220;interesting&#8221; activities.  1/3 of the URLs in my personal history are to mail.google.com (not something I would have&nbsp;expected).</p>
<p>Access to personal history is also the weapon we will bring into battle.  We <em>want</em> to have access to aggregate data, but we don&#8217;t, we don&#8217;t know when we will have that access, we don&#8217;t know <em>why</em> we should have that access, and we don&#8217;t know the value we will trade for it).  But history is ready for&nbsp;us!</p>
<p>History also points us at personally-valuable content that has no public web presence.  This content is the content that only a user agent has access to.  This is our unfair advantage.  We can scrape, process, re-present this information when no one else&nbsp;can.</p>
<h2>Big and annoying <span class="caps">UI</span></h2>
<p>I think we need to claim some space for this contextual recommendation.  This is not to assert that the &#8220;right&#8221; product will be big and bold and in-your-face.  Rather this is for our own&nbsp;consumption:</p>
<ol>
<li>As developers we should be constantly aware of what we are&nbsp;creating!</li>
<li>If there is the seed of value, we should be ready to see&nbsp;it</li>
<li>If there isn&#8217;t value, we shouldn&#8217;t hide that from ourselves, we should be confronted with&nbsp;it</li>
<li>As developers we need extra space to understand <em>why</em> we are getting results, because we have the ability to work backwards given that&nbsp;information</li>
</ol>
<p>This is based on the assumption that nothing we make now will be right, that our goal right now is learning and experimentation, and building the scaffolding for that&nbsp;learning.</p>
<h2>Retroactively apply techniques to&nbsp;history</h2>
<p>In my limited experience (a couple days of hacking), it&#8217;s difficult to get enough information from what gets picked up from new browsing.  Instead we want to retroactively apply our ideas to old history.  Some of this information we can pick up from Places (like URLs and some referrer information), but in other cases we want access to the content itself.  I&#8217;ve started to create a system to pull in that data, from an authenticated personal profile (though the current version of the page, not the historical version).  By doing this we can have copies of history that can be re-parsed relatively quickly, allowing us to switch up approaches with little&nbsp;penalty.</p>
<p>If we want to look at behavioral data in addition to content data it would be helpful to factor in whatever we can construct from Places, even if it is of lower fidelity than what we can get from new behavioral monitoring.  Places currently supports very &#8220;flat&#8221; access, but it contains enough information to construct a browsing graph in many&nbsp;cases.</p>
