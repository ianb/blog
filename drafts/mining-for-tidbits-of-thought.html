<p>Thinking more about the Remembrance Agent&#8230; what if linking wasn&#8217;t just an author concern, but also a user agent concern? What would it mean to automatically hyperlink content, maybe based on history? (Microsoft effort:&nbsp;http://alistapart.com/article/smarttags)</p>

<p>Some wandery&nbsp;thoughts&#8230;</p>
<p>Watching a little video about <span class="caps">APL</span> I was reminded about the Wolfram Language, and a little about the difference of = in math vs = in programming, the idea of expressing truths vs expressing instructions. I think there&#8217;s some analog between a live expression vs a traditional programming function, and call by reference vs call by value. That is, you don&#8217;t get access to the expression contained in the function, like you don&#8217;t get access to the state underlying an object in call by&nbsp;value.</p>
<p>Maybe this analogy doesn&#8217;t hold. There&#8217;s this sense about whether something is of a moment, or more universal. The copied value in a call by value call is the state as that moment, a local playground. The return value of a function feels&nbsp;similar.</p>
<p>Strict functional programming erases the difference between call by value and call by reference. You can&#8217;t tell an object from its copy if you can&#8217;t change it. Erlang can toss objects around as a result, shared state or not shared state doesn&#8217;t mean much. It works similarly for functions: a purely functional function, given an immutable input, the expression is deterministic, memoized or not the result will be the same, there is no sense of whether an expression is always live or only invoked on&nbsp;demand.</p>
<p>But functional schmunctional. It can erase the need to think about time in our computation, but the importance of time and coordination and change is still essential. Functional programming feels like avoidance. Which can be fine, partitioning the problem space can be useful, but you can&#8217;t get a solution through partitioning, you only hope to make the solution easier to find in that smaller&nbsp;space.</p>
<p>So what if we thought less about imperative instructions? Maybe it would be more like using &#8220;when&#8230; then&#8230;&#8221; instead of &#8220;if&#8230; then&#8230;&#8221;. (Maybe I&#8217;m just circling around functional reactive programming.) And also making functions less opaque. What can we know about a function? In a sense can a function answer <em>why?</em> To be able to introspect dependent state would be a kind of answer. But we might also be able to answer questions like: if this changes, what else will change? Can we reverse functions? We do that for properties, &#8220;obj.foo&#8221; vs &#8220;obj.foo = bar&#8221;. Maybe it doesn&#8217;t even have to be magic – getters and setters aren&#8217;t magic, you just write two&nbsp;functions.</p>
<p>Alright, enough&nbsp;wandering.</p>
<p><strong>Nick Bauman replies</strong>: Lisp macros give you access to the expression in the function. You never encounter this in other languages (because by definition the language would be a lisp if it had this&nbsp;feature).</p>
<p>The most important outcome of functional programming is the separation of state and identity. From this, reasoning about time becomes simple and straightforward. Without this, the past is always changing or the world seems to suffer from short term memory damage. In a functional and saner world, you are you, not just what last happened to you. Come over from the dark side of the force, Ian; <span class="caps">FP</span> is waiting for you here. And elegant weapon from a more civilized&nbsp;age.</p>
<p><strong>Sergey Schetinin replies</strong>: Macros are syntactical pattern-matchers on expressions, perhaps a better match from <span class="caps">LISP</span>-land to what Ian is describing would be fexprs. See also: &#8220;<span class="caps">CONS</span> should not evaluate its arguments&#8221;. As of getter-setter duality, see setf in Common&nbsp;Lisp.</p>
<p>Of course also reactive programming, logic programming and program synthesis. Of these I can vouch for <span class="caps">RP</span>, it definitely works and helps a lot, but when I look at how people are doing it, it looks either half-assed or with too much unnecessary decomposition, so it&#8217;s easy to learn to do it wrong (<span class="caps">IMO</span>&nbsp;obv.).</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not claiming there are any answers there, just something to check out to see where other people went with something&nbsp;similar.</p>
<p><strong>I reply</strong>: Thinking about macros, and <span class="caps">CONS</span> should not evaluate its arguments (http://www.cs.indiana.edu/cgi-bin/techreports/<span class="caps">TRNNN</span>.cgi?trnum=<span class="caps">TR44</span> – only read the abstract though), I think the lazy evaluation and notion of substitution are building blocks to this incomplete thought I have, but maybe it only seems interesting when you consider different operators besides &#8220;invoke&#8221;. That <span class="caps">CONS</span> paper for example seems to be about deferring invoke, but not using that deferred invocation for any particularly novel capabilities, only some novelty in the order of&nbsp;execution.</p>
<p>It becomes more interesting to be able to penetrate a function and see its innards when you have interesting things to do with it. Type inference is common, but eh, never got me excited. Debugging support is even more common, but treated as auxiliary, not legitimate to be used in the actual&nbsp;program.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s all very recursive, so I&#8217;m unsure about how to even talk about it – functions containing functions and expressions, and expressions are just series of functions (assuming you treat variables as value-getting functions, which I think you have to in order to think about this&nbsp;stuff).</p>
<p>From Common Lisp, setf is a little reminiscent of this. The notion that you can take an expression (car pair) and then reverse it (setf (car pair) 10). Not everything is reversable of course. You can&#8217;t (setf (square num) 9) – is num 3 or -3? It might be interesting if you allowed for a bifurcation of execution in those cases. Would the result ultimately&nbsp;collapse?</p>
<p>I can imagine a (possibilities) operator, to build something like quickcheck into the language. A way to identify non-determinism. (possibilities square) is empty, square never generates values, never acts non-deterministically. (possibilities button) returns &#8216;(click). (possibilities network-connection) might include connection abort, incoming data, etc. (And maybe what possibilities returns is actually opaque.) (possibilities some-function) needs to look inside&nbsp;some-function.</p>
<p>(when a-function return-value) might be another way to think about a function, to build constraint-based programming into your system. Or hell, (when a-function an-acceptor), because we can introspect everything, right? ;) Can we use when as a kind of assert, and use possibilities to search our program for&nbsp;errors?</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know what (why) does, but something cool. Obviously in this imaginary environment we have to reify execution state, so maybe you ask (why&nbsp;state).</p>
<p><strong>Sergey</strong>: The way I would describe the proposal from the <span class="caps">CONS</span> paper is to introduce &#8220;call-by-thunk&#8221; evaluation strategy (thunk being a function with zero arguments). As it&#8217;s implemented in the paper one can trivially extract both the form and the environment of those argument &#8220;suspensions&#8221; (in the paper&#8217;s terminology), but even if we don&#8217;t use it, we not only get lazy evaluation, but also generators (<span class="caps">AFAIK</span> both of those originated with that paper, it was novel in &#8216;76) &#8212; if the lazy cdr when evaluated is a cons with another cdr that is also a cons and so on, then we have an infinite list but it&#8217;s lazy, so it&#8217;s ok &#8212; it&#8217;s a generator. Pretty neat outcome from an apparently small change. I would say quite inspirational &#8212; what can we get if we introduce some other &#8220;call-by-???&#8221;&nbsp;?</p>
<p>fexpr is something a few early lisps played with, but it still lives today as an implementation detail. It&#8217;s a &#8220;call-by-expression&#8221;. All of lisp forms can be generalized to fexprs. In case of the normal procedure call evaluator evaluates all of the constituent subforms first in the environment (which it gets implicitly). If it&#8217;s some other form, it can use a different evaluation strategy for some of the fexprs, so macros are sort of a way to get access to the unevaluated fexpr args, but macros are compile-time only of course, so it&#8217;s a less general&nbsp;tool.</p>
<p>And we can try to consider what does it mean to be &#8220;call-by-expression&#8221;, what is the expression? Is it just <span class="caps">AST</span>? <span class="caps">AST</span> + captured environment? In case of macros the &#8220;captured environment&#8221; is something completely different from runtime captured environment with values bound to vars and stuff. If we use the argument as an expression and not immediately evaluate it, how should the compiler treat it? Are names mentioned in those expressions variable references in that scope or will the callee interpret them as something completely different? If we let the compiler itself peek and mark up those expressions with def-use relations for example, perhaps we want that info to be a part of what gets passed as the argument? It&#8217;s mind-bending&nbsp;stuff.</p>
<p>When you are talking about reversing functions and bifurcations we are clearly in logic programming territory. Personally I never quite understood purely logic programming languages. It&#8217;s so detached from normal imperative programming it hard to connect the two. However there&#8217;s a book that helped me with that a lot, because it explains a real logic programming <span class="caps">DSL</span> implemented (and therefore usable) in Scheme. I think you might benefit from it as well as far as how can one integrate (setf (square num) 9) into a normal programming language. The book is &#8220;A Reasoned Schemer&#8221; by the very same Friedman of the <span class="caps">CONS</span> paper. It&#8217;s idiosyncratic, but I liked&nbsp;it.</p>
<p>(possibilities some-function) makes me think of a case of symbolic-evaluation of that some-function. (Type inference can be viewed as symbolic evaluation as well, I think). (when ..) would probably be similar but with more logical programming&nbsp;flavour.</p>
<p>I wanted to give you a taste of what the reasoned schemer enables one to do, and just now found out that Clojure core.logic is apparently related:&nbsp;https://github.com/clojure/core.logic/wiki/A-Core.logic-Primer</p>
<p>Not sure what a good first example would be but == (called &#8216;unify&#8217;) is entirely symmetrical, so (== a 1) is no different from (== 1 a), which of course is what one would expect from logic programming, but I still find that exciting in context of actual, everyday&nbsp;programming.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: fexprs! Remember the kernal&nbsp;language?</p>

<p>From &#8220;Ask <span class="caps">HN</span>: How do you deal with professional jealousy and getting&nbsp;older?&#8221;:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It&#8217;s been getting better. For the first time in my life, my procrastination is starting to get tamed. I&#8217;ve been working hard on my first big project, and I expect it&#8217;s going to be a great one. But I can&#8217;t help but feel that if I had started in earnest at 25, at 21, at 19 — then maybe the list of accomplishments at the end of my life will be longer. Mentally, I&#8217;ve resigned to the fact that I&#8217;ve procrastinated away a decade of valuable time, and it just endlessly haunts&nbsp;me.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And a&nbsp;reply:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It&#8217;s not, it&#8217;s getting&nbsp;worse.</p>
<p>You are in a cycle of slave-driving yourself. You remind me of Jiddu Krishnamurthi&#8217;s assertion that &#8220;Influence acts strongest when you don&#8217;t realize that it is acting&#8221;. I would venture that most of your accomplishments are a result of being told what you should do, what you should&nbsp;be.</p>
<p>You will <span class="caps">NEVER</span> have the energy that the people whom you compare with have. Because they are being themselves, and are connected to the natural wellspring of motivation that comes from genuine interest, while you are the salmon swimming upstream, aping societal ideals and trying to be someone you are&nbsp;not.</p>
<p>Choose the opposite for a while : stop doing things that don&#8217;t motivate you. Find out what motivates you. Be spontaneous. If you find a small plant at the roadside that you want to water, do it. Observe that absolutely no effort was required in this action. This is the mark of genuine flow : you will not feel the effort. If you chance upon some project which you execute in this natural state of interest, you will not feel&nbsp;tired.</p>
<p>Almost no one takes my advice because it&#8217;s so threatening to be natural. What if you are not naturally ambitious? That&#8217;s a horrific thought to have while being in the company of achievers, isn&#8217;t&nbsp;it?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One of the unfortunate parts of privilege is that we don&#8217;t even take very good advantage of&nbsp;it.</p>
<p>I was listening to this podcast recently, in which among other things they profile a woman who lost her sense of fear:&nbsp;http://www.npr.org/programs/invisibilia/377515477/fearless</p>
<p>She lives a mostly normal but somewhat peculiar life. She knows danger intellectually, just not emotionally. She&#8217;s been assaulted several times, probably all in circumstances where a person with a normal sense of fear would have avoided the circumstance. But she doesn&#8217;t seem traumatized by it either, these are just facts. Which raises the question: do we need fear? Of course we need fear! But maybe like vaccination it&#8217;s sufficient to have herd fear. Society itself is afraid that safety will cultivate laziness. But it could also cultivate boldness and bravery. Society&#8217;s very fear of laziness and hedonism may be what makes of so cautious, our actions so tepid, because we are reluctant to allow people to take advantage of their privilege. And we are <span class="caps">ALL</span> so privileged now, it&#8217;s not a 1% or 10% phenomena, it&#8217;s more like the top 80%. But we fear the laziness of the bottom most, and repress them most, make them them least capable of taking advantage of what is nearly within their&nbsp;grasp.</p>
<p>I might be slipping into some bizarro version of Ayn Rand, a notion of an anarchist ubermensch. That wasn&#8217;t really where I was expecting to go, when all I meant to say was I really liked how this person talked about letting go of&nbsp;ambition&#8230;</p>
<hr>
<p>As we consume information, are we also composing&#8230; composing internally, creating new thoughts, reactions, all in our heads. Not a composition like a newspaper article, but just a personal journal. Some of this composition sticks in our heads, is remixed later in our dreams and through our forgetfulness, and tied into future consumptive compositions. Much is lost, maybe that&#8217;s why browsing can feel like an obsessive forward collecting, like we&#8217;re information Pacmans – move forward to avoid acknowledging how fleeting our compositions are (compositions that appear frighteningly synonymous with our&nbsp;souls).</p>
<p>I recall an article about Ted Nelson (of Hypertext/Xanadu fame) in which it was noted he obsessively recorded his own activity. It struck me as an intellectual non sequitur at the time. And what would he, or anyone else, ever do with all that video? So maybe that&#8217;s the link between obsessive recording and an obsession with information&nbsp;organization.</p>
<p>But even if we can&#8217;t capture thoughts, can&#8217;t permanently journal otherwise transient observations, we can capture your actions on a computer. Some hint, some bit of evidence of these passing thoughts. But we don&#8217;t do a lot with that. There&#8217;s something there I&nbsp;think.</p>
<p><strong>Ed S</strong>: It&#8217;s horrifying how little we retain of what we read. Read this earlier today: &#8220;&#8221;&#8220;In 1971 Herbert Simon predicted, “A wealth of information creates a poverty of attention and a need to allocate that attention efficiently.” The new scarcity turned out to be engagement.&nbsp;&#8220;&#8221;&#8220;</p>
<p><strong>Alex</strong>: I find myself going very hot-and-cold when it comes to recording my behavior. I compulsively seek out, construct, and refine systems for this purpose. There&#8217;s a lingering anxiety, however, in the underlying knowledge I&#8217;m not doing anything with the information. This makes it hard to stay motivated to maintain such systems. I figure I need better-designed systems. Either completely automatic and highly searchable/computable, or more clearly oriented toward a finite&nbsp;goal.</p>
<p>But I&#8217;ve definitely thought about this a lot. Wondered if there was some way for me to automatically compute <span class="amp">&amp;</span> deliver meaningful insights to myself about my behavior, as I browse. Or describe personal goals, routines, values, etc., and have my computer recognize certain behavior patterns and nudge me in a more personally valuable direction now and&nbsp;then.</p>
<p><strong>Me</strong>: We need artificial intelligence, nay, consciousness, that someone may be able to appreciate every artifact of our lives, all the moments too tedious for others, too tedious even for us to be bothered to gaze upon our own activity. Artificial consciousness so that someone may remember us, even remember the in between&nbsp;moments&#8230;</p>

<p>Interesting reply on flat structures from Valve/Gabe:&nbsp;https://external-preview.redd.it/uvAyDG-qgos1KOFkY95A1mgf0hHwLKZewOqI6Z6kHYg.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=6dec363ef7d42883951bdddda1b89170a08972c0</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve read a fair number of accounts of what it feels like to be in technology as a member of an outgroup – from women or minorities or people who don&#8217;t fit the cultures self-conception of meritocracy. And that&#8217;s useful, I&#8217;ve learned from those, but I realize it&#8217;s not very actionable. So often the accounts are about things I don&#8217;t perceive. Maybe unconscious bias (which I may perpetrate, but unconsciously). Maybe overt harassment (which I don&#8217;t perpetrate, don&#8217;t often notice, but may unwittingly&nbsp;witness).</p>
<p>If I want to do something actionable, the accounts only get me half the way, because they help me know what it&#8217;s like to be in a difficult situation, but don&#8217;t do as much to help me know what to look for from my own perspective. Because whatever happens I&#8217;m going to experience it as a white male, and often as a bystander. I don&#8217;t even have to be particularly innocent to usually end up as a bystander, the numbers just work out that way. But what should I look out for, that sign I am a bystander, that sign that I could intervene? (The sign I am perhaps deliberately trying to avoid, for it is always easier and safer to not intervene.) The victim cannot tell me. The advocate, with breathless urgency, tells me the exact wrong thing – for I must be reminded of the banality of it, because my observations are mostly banal, and stories that are not about myself are always at risk of being skimmed. So if I am to see the story of a peer, see a dysfunction not directed at myself, I need details, I need to be shown the signals. And if anyone is going to show me, it should probably be that other white guy who was mostly minding his own business, interested but unsure, who ultimately did nothing but on retrospect, with an added perspective, would have rather he had done&nbsp;something.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not a story I&#8217;ve heard. It&#8217;s also not a very interesting story, but it&#8217;s the one that would help me know when to&nbsp;act.</p>
<hr>
<p>Somewhere I heard someone talking about genetics, whether we are made of <span class="caps">DNA</span>, defined by our genetics. And he asked: have you seen <span class="caps">DNA</span> without a cell? And no, there is a continuity: the <span class="caps">DNA</span> is never naked, it is always found inside a cell, which is to say that those cells have as long a history as the genes they contain. It made me think about life and heritage more&nbsp;holistically</p>
<p>I was thinking about nature vs. nurture this evening, while listening to some discussion of gender, and was reminded of this. It has been a long time, and many species, since we have reproduced without a period of nurturing. We talk sometimes about how much &#8220;we&#8221; impose on children, imagine who they might be without societies many repressions. More, we imagine there is an underlying truth to the child, that we are covering up their true self. What then would be the truest person? A feral child? That is a painful and sad existence, that child was not given the freedom to be their true self. Our nurturing is a defining part of ourselves, it is our heritage as much as our genes. Is my true self the color of my hair? The values with which I was raised? Is my true self only what I choose? All that is given to me belongs to history, not to me? Something like language seems intrinsic to humanity, like we are built for it – yet you skip the nurturing process for only one generation and it would be lost again for&nbsp;millennia.</p>
<hr>
<p>I gave this podcast a relisten the other day:&nbsp;http://www.econtalk.org/archives/2013/09/tyler_cowen_on.html</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a conversation on the future, based on Tyler Cowen&#8217;s deliberately boring predictions. I&#8217;d call them &#8220;conventional&#8221; predictions, but they aren&#8217;t – conventional predictions tend to be breathless and designed to gain attention, rather than trying to be correct. Cowen&#8217;s predictions aren&#8217;t radical, but then they start to talk through the implications and it feels like it matters. As a father, I feel an obligation to prepare my children for this future. I&#8217;m not going to stop the future, I can only change it in small ways, but I can have a significant effect on the children in my life. I haven&#8217;t really decided what this implies for me in&nbsp;practice.</p>
<p>One thing that struck me this time through is there discussion of politics towards the end. Cowen thinks that the highly privileged will grow in number, he talks about something like 15% of the population living like the millionaires of today. I haven&#8217;t read his book so I don&#8217;t know how he comes to that, but it feels reasonable, I see that expansion happening now. That class of people is highly invested in The System. I imagine it could be like the new political middle class – that is, a group of people who have enough resources to hold some political autonomy and initiative, while also being a high enough quantity of people to matter in the polls and as part of the on-the-ground political conversation. The result of this would be a more conservative politics, specifically more resistant to populism on the right and left. Combine it with an aging population and things start to look downright&nbsp;boring.</p>
<p>Another thought I had as they were talking about higher education – they talk about how the best presenters will have a larger audience, the best schools will still have a clear tenure track, but it&#8217;s unclear what everyone else does. What will we be looking for in the next generation of professors? MOOCs to me seem more like an exercise in revealing the weaknesses of our current system. The system tells itself that teaching is important, and the instructional material is important, and assignments and blah blah blah&#8230; but the result is a bunch of web pages and videos and online forums, and it&#8217;s kind of pathetic-looking. To the degree higher education succeeds at its goals (and I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s particularly successful), it doesn&#8217;t understand quite&nbsp;why.</p>
<p>The new class of worker they talk about is the coach. This is something computers don&#8217;t do particularly well. I think in part because the computer can never imbue a topic with importance. Computers cycles are cheap. No one is giving up anything to have a computer email you, or talk to you, or remind you of things. To make oneself accountable, even self-accountable, requires some sacrifice. And there&#8217;s something about a human coach that embodies&nbsp;that.</p>
<p>What might it mean if we combine a coach with the <span class="caps">MOOC</span>, or a whole set of available tools and environments? This coaching happens at various times in upper education, but it&#8217;s very ad hoc. Who teaches you study skills? Who has an honest conversation about your motivations and fears? Who do you go to when you don&#8217;t think things are working? Sometimes there is a trusted person, a teacher, parent, professor – but usually no&nbsp;one.</p>
<p>Imagine after high school, you decide on a set of goals. Not a five-year plan, just some next steps. Maybe you don&#8217;t know what you want to do next, so you want to explore a breadth of topics. Maybe you want to accomplish something specific. Maybe you want to progress along an academic track. Then you make a plan. Maybe you need to understand why your work is relevant, so you need some real world experience. Maybe you want to find yourself, and so you want something more like the less worldly environment of a college campus. For the price of a college education (which apparently we consider a reasonable price for that post-high-school experience) you can buy a lot of personal attention and a lot of different&nbsp;experiences.</p>
<p>A coaching model could seem like a lot of wimpy handholding. Like a formalization of laziness. And maybe it would be – but in part it just seems like an honest attempt at guidance. Much more honest than our current educational system, which throws people into a structure and calls it a meritocracy that some people succeed and some do not, when it simultaneously is an educational institution where it&#8217;s supposed to help people&nbsp;succeed.</p>

<p>The Shipping Culture Is Hurting Us: http://bitbashing.io/2015/02/16/shipping-culture.html (a <em>Get off my lawn!</em> style&nbsp;rant)</p>
<p>Starting it I thought it might be similar in sense to my <span class="caps">MVP</span> post from a few weeks back (https://www.ianbicking.org/blog/2015/01/product-journal-mvp.html). But no, it&#8217;s mostly about technology choices. And I think that&#8217;s quite the point. For instance, to&nbsp;quote:</p>
<p><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>The problem is that these technologies, being so beginner-friendly and aggressively marketed, rapidly pick up steam and become the “cool” things to use, regardless of actual merit or lack thereof. Nothing illustrated this more to me than when I went to my first (and only) hackathon last year. I went with the assumption that I would see a wild variety of projects using a wild variety of technologies. Instead, I found the vast majority of contestants there writing some web app, usually with Node.js and MongoDB. It certainly didn’t help that MongoDB people were there, at the hackathon, marketing their&nbsp;wares.&#8221;</p>
<p>Were the people at the hackathon trying to show off some awesome Noding and Mongoing? Probably not, they were probably trying to make something they thought was cool. Nothing the author talks about in this article actually is about making something cool, it&#8217;s all&nbsp;tools.</p>
<p>I think there&#8217;s reason to be skeptical of &#8220;shipping culture&#8221; as a way to make cool things. Maybe it&#8217;s because I&#8217;m sensitive to the obligation of work in the wild. The danger of investing in conventional wisdom. But the tech? It&#8217;s like letting yourself be bogged down by legacy you haven&#8217;t even acquired yet – all the obligation of having shipped something without any of the&nbsp;reward.</p>

<p><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>Back during World War <span class="caps">II</span>, the <span class="caps">RAF</span> lost a lot of planes to German anti-aircraft fire. So they decided to armor them up. But where to put the armor? The obvious answer was to look at planes that returned from missions, count up all the bullet holes in various places, and then put extra armor in the areas that attracted the most&nbsp;fire.</p>
<p><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>Obvious but wrong. As Hungarian-born mathematician Abraham Wald explained at the time, if a plane makes it back safely even though it has, say, a bunch of bullet holes in its wings, it means that bullet holes in the wings aren&#8217;t very dangerous. What you really want to do is armor up the areas that, on average, don&#8217;t have any bullet holes. Why? Because planes with bullet holes in those places never made it back. That&#8217;s why you don&#8217;t see any bullet holes there on the ones that do return.&#8221; (From&nbsp;http://www.motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2010/09/counterintuitive-world)</p>
<p>When considering software practice and process I wonder if we make the same mistake, looking to armor the area with the most bullet holes. Every time you have to maintain some buggy annoying and difficult piece of software, you are patching up one of the planes that got home, that made it through. No one maintains the software that never made it through battle. The projects that flew on until they ran out of fuel, and due to navigator error never turned around to head home to base. There&#8217;s lots of failure modes. Most of them aren&#8217;t contingent on the quality of the software&nbsp;engineering.</p>

<p>Listening to Alan Watts&nbsp;(http://zencast.org/zencast-455-what-is-by-alan-watts):</p>
<p>Nature: the mechanistic surroundings that contain us (or do not! much debate!) Libido: the mechanism of&nbsp;self-reproduction.</p>
<p>Remove the titillation from libido and it is still most certainly a thing, but it also seems almost unrecognizable. It is not hard to acknowledge that we see nature as mechanistic, despite any appreciation we may have for its mechanism. Acknowledging libido as natural is easy in the abstract, hard in practice. Acknowledging libido as natural, mechanistic, and also part of our psyche and perhaps part of our soul – it is challenging to make all those ideas intellectually&nbsp;consistent.</p>

<p>One thing that struck me was how much the boss behavior described here looks like micromanagement. Which is to say: if your boss is micromanaging you, maybe it&#8217;s not because your boss is a micromanager, but instead they just think you are a poor performer. The paper also has some good insights into how this becomes a cycle, both affecting performance and the perception of&nbsp;performance.</p>
<hr>
<p>Maybe we anthropomorphosize so many things not because of some bias or social overlay on our thinking, but because we developed abstract thinking as a social tool, just as another part of our brain developed another way of thinking to interpret images. And then our so-called &#8220;rational&#8221; mind is just a hack to reuse a specifically social tool as a general purpose problem solver. Like mining Bitcoin on your <span class="caps">GPU</span> - that&#8217;s handy the <span class="caps">GPU</span> can do that, but no one would call it a stupid <span class="caps">GPU</span> if it happened to be bad at mining&nbsp;Bitcoin.</p>

<p>This article summarizes well many (all?) request for open dialogue; quoting much of the&nbsp;article:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Let’s ask: When it comes to sex, what’s permitted? What’s off-limits? What should stay private? I have specific answers in mind for each of these questions, but until we start framing them in an indignant way that makes it impossible to differ with me, progress cannot and will not&nbsp;happen.</p>
<p>The progress I speak of is only possible through the discursive exchange of opinions I already&nbsp;hold.</p>
<p>And let me just say that being “uncomfortable” with this discourse is no excuse. If that’s how people feel, then we must find a way to move from “uncomfortable” to “zealous outrage in favor of all my positions.” We need to do more than just acknowledge these views. We need to congratulate me for forming&nbsp;them.</p>

<p>I sometimes think about how the built and natural world could intersect more fully. As humans we are generally capable of enhancing growth through our effort. We use that for certain ends, to grow food or well manicured golf courses. But I think we could achieve any number of&nbsp;goals.</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t help but look at many a forest and think: this seems very inefficient. There are points of intensity, a clearing, a pond, a grand tree. Some plant life feels like it gives freely of itself, and some does not – many perennials seem well invested in withholding their energy, even withholding from growth from the plant itself. I wonder about fallen leaves and needles – part of me thinks they are actually evolved as a weed suppressant, leaving the ground covered with a mat of life-suppressing material. Forests seem relatively quiet, devoid of life, compared to environments filled with vascular plants, plants that live fast rather than&nbsp;long.</p>
<p>And what if we were to design for this? Big scale – bulldozers and irrigation and amendments. And a place for humans, but with neither as an afterthought; not just a cabin in the woods, and not just lawns between buildings on a&nbsp;campus.</p>
<p>I came upon this Buckminster Fuller city design. The fun old futurist designs people don&#8217;t do anymore (or if they do, I&#8217;d be great fun to see). It is of a scale that would be a sort of environment. And it seems implied that there would be considerable landscaping, but I assume all on top of concrete. I&#8217;m suspicious of this sense that you can just implant a natural environment so easily. (For example: http://persquaremile.com/2013/03/07/trees-dont-like-it-up-there/ – but then apparently at least one building is getting along: http://www.dezeen.com/2014/05/15/stefano-boeri-bosco-verticale-vertical-forest-milan-skyscrapers/ and maybe it&#8217;s not all just artist&nbsp;renderings).</p>
<p>I guess part of the desire is to be embedded in nature. When you start with a flat ground and move up then you will not be embedded, even if you only go up a couple floors. So it seems attractive to turn someone else&#8217;s roof into your outdoor space. I feel like there&#8217;s a puzzle in this that might have some other solution, some of the intensity without quite so much&nbsp;concrete.</p>

<p>My sister-in-law&#8217;s car was broken into last night (she&#8217;s also our next door neighbor). We&#8217;ve had these problems regularly. Along with various miscellany that was stolen was my foster-niece&#8217;s graduation dress (I&#8217;ll call her&nbsp;Z).</p>
<p>We are all white and middle class. Z is not. And Z is much more security conscious than we are. To some degree from experience – we don&#8217;t live in a very safe neighborhood, but Z has lived in worse. But it&#8217;s also a lot harder when she has lost material things. It&#8217;s a pain in the butt when we have something stolen, but whatever, we get new stuff. We can manage our risk. We can insure anything we can&#8217;t afford to&nbsp;lose.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know if our neighborhood is gentrifying. Lots of people in the neighborhood are stressed out about that possibility. I might consider myself the face of gentrification, except I don&#8217;t consider myself an interloper and wouldn&#8217;t really accept that classification. When the subject of safety comes up gentrification also often comes up. Perhaps because we see the more privileged members of the community worrying about security. But isn&#8217;t that just a function of the visibility of the privileged? For most of these problems that the gentrifiers identify, complain about, and try to fix, I suspect the impact is greater on the less privileged in the&nbsp;community.</p>
<p>Or let&#8217;s take the example of guys loitering. Sometimes it turns into yelling and drinking and stuff like that, and that can make me uncomfortable, and I think about doing something about it, and sometimes I do. But I could also tolerate it. Those people don&#8217;t really affect me. I can easily avoid them. Mostly we pass by each other like we&#8217;re in two different worlds. Maybe they don&#8217;t have a better place to hang out, maybe this is their community building. But it&#8217;s not just annoying to Z – these are the guys that proposition her, who give catcalls when she and her friends go&nbsp;by.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve heard references to Smalltalk 72 before, the version before Smalltalk-76 that basically contained all the features we know about Smalltalk today. From what I&#8217;d heard Smalltalk-72 has a more open grammar than later Smalltalks, more appropriate for <span class="caps">DSL</span>-like systems. But I&#8217;d only heard references, but came upon this&nbsp;manual:</p>
<p>http://www.textfiles.com/bitsavers/pdf/xerox/alto/Smalltalk72_Manual.pdf</p>
<p>(Via an emulator: http://lively-web.org/users/Dan/<span class="caps">ALTO</span>-Smalltalk-72.html)</p>
<p>On Page 22 they note even more funny characters in use than they ended up with, including a smiley face. On Page 26 I am noticing that methods names weren&#8217;t more dynamic, like &#8220;joe grow 100&#8221; which in later Smalltalks would be &#8220;joe grow: 100&#8221;. The Logo roots of Smalltalk are clearer here too. For instance, using &#8220;to&#8221; as the function/method definition word. Also the kind of reversed Forth style that Logo has, where the value at the beginning of the expression kind of grabs values from the later parts of the expression (though unlike Logo, it&#8217;s doing it at the token/syntactic&nbsp;level).</p>
<p>That&#8217;s just a very limited perusal, but it&#8217;d be fun to look at this more, as the-Smalltalk-that-never-was (well, technically it existed, but in&nbsp;obscurity).</p>

<p>I appreciate someone offering a more empathetic view on gender issues in tech, instead of analysis in the service of&nbsp;righteousness.</p>
<p>She&#8217;s basically talking about the difficulty of building an intimate and trusting working relationship when there is even the theoretical possibility of&nbsp;romance.</p>
<p>Reading some comments in reaction (https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7407280) I think what she talks about is being thought about too much in terms of unwanted romantic propositions. I think there&#8217;s just as much of a problem where men and women can&#8217;t build that trusting working relationship because they don&#8217;t open themselves up to it – all the paths to that relationship feel too much like romance, and so they get cut off. And with the lack of a trusting relationship things either stay coldly professional or else things get weird, the resentment and alienation and defensiveness can create a bad feedback loop – which at least my brief reading of the GitHub controversy seems to point to (http://techcrunch.com/2014/03/15/julie-ann-horvath-describes-sexism-and-intimidation-behind-her-github-exit/). But usually it&#8217;s just coldly professional, which is not actually all that awesome&nbsp;either.</p>
<p>Probably in the tech community we are worse at building these positive relationships in general than many other professional communities. It&#8217;s the nature of the work and the personality types who are drawn to the work. But I think we put too much weight on the negative manifestations of this – the negative events come out so strongly because we don&#8217;t have enough healthy positive relationships, it&#8217;s like we&#8217;re immunocompromised and these events are the pneumonia that will bring us down unless we each walk around in a bubble. But these bubbles don&#8217;t make us&nbsp;stronger.</p>

<p>Usually when we talk about Sunk Costs, we are talking about a particular kind of incorrect strategic thinking. That is, if you made an investment in the past, that money is gone – it&#8217;s a sunk cost. It doesn&#8217;t mean that the investment has present value, and so you should still reevaluate if the strategy is correct before investing further. I.e., don&#8217;t throw good money after&nbsp;bad.</p>
<p>Another incorrect kind of strategic thinking: when you invest something in the past, and decide that you shouldn&#8217;t have made that investment, you can&#8217;t undo that investment. If the investment was valueless then you shouldn&#8217;t feel committed to that line of strategy. But if the investment was merely suboptimal, if it was the wrong investment in retrospect, it does not mean that further investment is incorrect! You have whatever returns and whatever potential that came from that investment, regardless of what you gave up or what path you didn&#8217;t take. Of course there are lessons to be learned, but it&#8217;s no good to&nbsp;overlearn.</p>
<p>The first fallacy is a bias for some course of action because of past investment. The second fallacy is is a bias against some course of action because of past investment. Looking at investments as sunk cost should be used to remove both kinds of&nbsp;biases.</p>
<p>(I once read an interview with a professional poker player where he said the hardest thing to do was to keep playing the right strategy after making a series of big losses using that strategy, because if it&#8217;s the right strategy that doesn&#8217;t mean you don&#8217;t lose, or even that you don&#8217;t lose big, or that you don&#8217;t lose many times in a&nbsp;row.)</p>

<p>It&#8217;s hard to avoid projecting moralism and immediate prescriptive policy implications into any analysis of poverty, but if you can avoid doing that this is an interesting data&nbsp;point.</p>
<p>The core of this article is a graph of an individual&#8217;s average expenditure for a given income. You can just make it out in the preview. The graph can also be seen as the choices many individuals may be making: what is the reward for making more than I make currently? Not everyone&#8217;s personal curve looks like this, but it gives a fuzzy picture of&nbsp;options.</p>
<p>At the lowest end expenditures actually go down as you make a little more money, but the bottom probably isn&#8217;t worth paying much attention to. The very bottom is a bucket with a lot of people who are medically unable to work. But if you look up the line, the theoretical advantage to making $20k instead of $15k ($5k) is much less than the apparent actual advantage of $1k. So lets say you work for the minimum wage of $7.25/hr, and to make $15k/year you have to work pretty much 40 hours a week. Let&#8217;s say you take on a second job to bump that up to $20k, which requires another 13 hours a week.  Over the course of a year you will work an additional 676 hours in order to make an additional $1k, for about a net gain \$1.50 per hour. Who wants to do&nbsp;that?</p>
<p>Why is the return on labor so poor at this low end? I&#8217;m not sure exactly what the <span class="caps">BLS</span> Consumer Expenditure statistics really capture, and they aren&#8217;t longitudinal, so we don&#8217;t know if this is just how people smooth their own variable income, or how large systems like Social Security influence this. But it&#8217;s a hint at a rational reason for people to stay in poverty. Or if you flip this graph around a bit you can get the steep curve that represents the hole that people in poverty find challenging to get out&nbsp;of.</p>
<p>But to get to any strong policy implication you&#8217;d need numbers that are far less aggregated than&nbsp;these.</p>

<p>From a talk by Alan Kay; first a&nbsp;slide:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Have the browser be more like an <span class="caps">OS</span> kernel than an&nbsp;app</p>
<p>Manage and protect the screen and computer resources, but distribute everything&nbsp;else.</p>
<p>For example, just allow foreign code, including binaries, but run them completely encapsulated within an address space, and intermediate all I/O and system&nbsp;calls.</p>
<p>[Then, from his&nbsp;talking:]</p>
<p>This is operating system 101, this is well known all the way back in 1965 and 1966. It should be the first thing that occurs to anybody. [&#8230;] Everybody in the 60s and 70s knew this was to do it, we were all surprised it wasn&#8217;t done this&nbsp;way.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I find Alan Kay&#8217;s curmudgeonly take on the web a bit frustrating. It seems rather in conflict with that famous quote: &#8220;The best way to predict the future is to invent it&#8221; – well, other people could have done the web <span class="caps">VM</span>-style, but they didn&#8217;t, and the web architecture belongs to the people who built&nbsp;it.</p>
<p>But! Other people have tried to take this other path. Applets, PNaCl, and I&#8217;m sure dozens or even hundreds of other attempts. I think the evidence is that the non-<span class="caps">VM</span> approach was the right approach, and despite persistent (and continuing!) beliefs that we took the wrong path, and attempts to redirect that path, we still continue on this same path. The path of wide-spread and sometimes uncomfortable consensus on document models, execution models, network conventions, and so on. These conventions evolve, yes, but it&#8217;s the web evolving as one big messy thing, instead of a least common denominator&nbsp;approach.</p>
<p>Later Alan Kay compares <span class="caps">IQ</span> to Knowledge and to Outlook. He asserts knowledge is more important than <span class="caps">IQ</span>, and outlook (or a good outlook) is more important than knowledge. Da Vinci couldn&#8217;t build an engine for his vehicles not because he lacked <span class="caps">IQ</span>, but because he lacked knowledge. And then he says we have a problem of too much cleverness. Which is again a bit frustrating – the <span class="caps">VM</span> is a clever approach. The web is the knowledge&nbsp;approach.</p>
<p>Or maybe instead of &#8220;knowledge&#8221; I&#8217;d say the positive legacy we inherit. The web, with it&#8217;s strong and intrusive models, gives us the benefit of knowledge – maybe not the best knowledge, but some decent knowledge. But more so, it constrains us so that what we build on the web contributes to everyone else&#8217;s knowledge, a virtuous cycle. Not just programming knowledge, but knowledge as a whole – the web most empowers programmers indirectly, because it makes programming relevant rather than making the programmer powerful. And it&#8217;s been worth the&nbsp;tradeoff.</p>
<p>I just get annoyed, because I really respect Alan Kay, but he comes off as curmudgeonly when he talks about the&nbsp;web.</p>
<p>(re:&nbsp;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvmTSpJU-Xc)</p>

<p>I think corporatism vs humanism (aka universalism) is a political axis we should think more about. Or think about at all, I don&#8217;t know that I&#8217;ve ever seen them contrasted. Perhaps because corporatism is a miscognate - it seems constrained to the entity we know as the &#8220;corporation&#8221; but it is far more general than that, including what we call &#8220;special interests&#8221; and &#8220;identity politics&#8221; - it&#8217;s about looking at people as groups with group interests. It&#8217;s the thing that unites the Clintons and Romney, but I truly think Obama is on the other side - which is why he&#8217;s has not just a hard, but a confusing fight. We don&#8217;t even understand or have language to talk about the difference. And when you are focused only on a different axis (like left-vs-right) Obama seems so unsatisfying. I&#8217;m sure this confusion extends to the many individuals that make up the Executive&nbsp;leadership.</p>
<p>For the last several years I have been unable to quite determine if I like a technocracy. Part of me does, but I don&#8217;t discount the common belief that &#8220;technocrat&#8221; has bad connotations. But this helps me understand that. Technocracy is not incompatible with corporatism. And if you start talking about that combination you&#8217;ll probably end up in Godwin territory (i.e. taking about &#8220;fascism&#8221;). And it is not unfair! A humanist technocracy is something else though. Maybe it is dangerously utilitarian, but at least we&#8217;re a little further in the&nbsp;discussion.</p>

<p>Idly checking out the Wolfram Language. I come upon this page, which is not particularly notable:&nbsp;https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/Sow.html</p>

<p>It&#8217;s a funny language feature that I haven&#8217;t imagined before, but that&#8217;s not really the point. The point is that this is a runnable example – that&#8217;s actually what is output. Typically when you run something like that you get NameError: a is not defined. And &#8220;a&#8221; here is really a variable, of sorts – it&#8217;s not a string or symbol (at least not a symbol in the sense that we know them in&nbsp;programming).</p>
<p>Given this, snippets of code are just as executable as entire programs. Every expression is like a function with the free variables as its parameters, and a sequence of expressions is a bit like function&nbsp;composition.</p>
<p>This is all natural from the perspective of mathematic notation. In a more traditional programming environment I think it&#8217;s reminiscent of partial evaluation: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partial_evaluation – where you analyze a program and execute expressions opportunistically. It&#8217;s really almost the same as partial evaluation, but the Wolfram Language knows a lot more about how you can execute different combinations of expressions than a typical language. A typical language does not really &#8220;believe&#8221; that (a+b) and (b+a) are equivalent. It doesn&#8217;t know how to relate different operations. Nor do normal languages have a concept of simplification, so they can&#8217;t speculatively try other arrangements (where none in isolation is clearly better or simpler than another) to see if simplifications are&nbsp;possible.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m really impressed with John Ralston Saul in this interview:&nbsp;http://www.econtalk.org/archives/2013/11/john_ralston_sa.html</p>
<p>The basic topic of discussion is rationality, or against rationality in favor of humanism. Interestingly the host seems to want to agree with Saul, but he can&#8217;t – he&#8217;s too committed to rational&nbsp;libertarianism.</p>
<p>I need to figure out how to gel my ideas about this – the intellectual process he talks about is not well suited to a&nbsp;conclusion.</p>

<p>Reading http://blog.stephenwolfram.com/2013/11/something-very-big-is-coming-our-most-important-technology-project-yet/ I&#8217;m not convinced this isn&#8217;t actually something big, and perhaps could address the things I talk about in&nbsp;https://www.ianbicking.org/blog/2013/10/why-isnt-programming-futuristic.html</p>
<p>Following by watching this presentation: http://vimeo.com/44968627 builds on it some, bringing what I expect are some of its concepts down to a more accessible level. He refers to at least some of the concepts as Functional Reactive Programming (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_reactive_programming), which is a deeply unsatisfying wiki&nbsp;page.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a certain intermediacy to everything in this model. Nothing is clearly started or finished. Maybe that&#8217;s a good way to think of live objects.; no final conclusion has been made. And that&#8217;s where most software lives, executing and evolving beside us. Everything that isn&#8217;t live is just a one-off (or N-off)&nbsp;script.</p>

<p>A way in which <span class="caps">ASCII</span> code is inferior to a theoretical graphical expression of code: we don&#8217;t have any way to express multidimensional annotations of expressions. Mostly all we have is function composition: a(b(c)). Now you could imagine some &#8220;different&#8221; annotation operator, like perhaps square(1\meters) instead of square(meters(1)), this only works for simple annotations. What happens when the annotation becomes larger than the thing being annotated? At that point we become terribly uncomfortable because the &#8220;meat&#8221; of the code is buried in endless terrible unrelated code clutter. But sometimes the meat of a problem is simple and elegant, and the interpretation of that result is the much more bulky and arbitrary bit of code. Think of algorithm code vs. <span class="caps">UI</span> code. And so we separate these concerns because it&#8217;s the right thing to do, but what if it isn&#8217;t the right thing to do? What if we&#8217;re doing it just because we can&#8217;t stand to have the annotation outweigh the core logic, and we don&#8217;t have tools that allow us to manage that kind of complexity. And we probably can&#8217;t have the tools in <span class="caps">ASCII</span> because the data density wouldn&#8217;t just be higher, but more&nbsp;bizarre.</p>

<p>I wonder if it would be more productive to think in terms of units instead of types. Something not exactly advisory, but rather something meant to add value to working programs, not just identify problems in broken programs. (Well, types are useful for more than just that, but I&nbsp;digress.)</p>
<p>A unit is something that says what a value is, but still allows a great many expressions. I don&#8217;t know what (1m)*(1hrs) could possibly mean, but we can progress using that unit information and see where it goes. Types tend to emphasize a minimal interface on each individual type, and not very expressive type composition systems. How many systems are willing to create a type like mult(<type1>, <type2>)? And then to allow further operations on that type, potentially to an arbitrary level at runtime? How many can express &#8220;9.8m/s^2&#8221; as a&nbsp;type?</p>
<p>This is like a side annotation on the object itself, which can be manipulated alongside the main value of the object. Like if every object carried around its own metadata. If you treated that metadata carefully could you maintain its integrity through an entire&nbsp;program?</p>
<p>This allows us to somewhat blithely create a program that pushes well past the place where we&#8217;d traditionally encounter a fatal error. You might have to rewind some ways to figure out why you are trying to send velocities over a socket, even if velocity and characters were both numbers that simply had different units. But at the same time, you&#8217;ve added to the history of that errant velocity along the way, allowing you to follow back the thread of that error in ways a simple stack trace do not&nbsp;allow.</p>

<p>To quote the abstract in&nbsp;full:</p>
<p><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>Human decision-making strategies are strongly influenced by an awareness of certainty or uncertainty (a form of metacognition) to increase the chances of making a right choice. Humans seek more information and defer choosing when they realize they have insufficient information to make an accurate decision, but whether animals are aware of uncertainty is currently highly contentious. To explore this issue, we examined how honey bees (Apis mellifera) responded to a visual discrimination task that varied in difficulty between trials. Free-flying bees were rewarded for a correct choice, punished for an incorrect choice, or could avoid choosing by exiting the trial (opting out). Bees opted out more often on difficult trials, and opting out improved their proportion of successful trials. Bees could also transfer the concept of opting out to a novel task. Our data show that bees selectively avoid difficult tasks they lack the information to solve. This finding has been considered as evidence that nonhuman animals can assess the certainty of a predicted outcome, and bees&#8217; performance was comparable to that of primates in a similar paradigm. We discuss whether these behavioral results prove bees react to uncertainty or whether associative mechanisms can explain such findings. To better frame metacognition as an issue for neurobiological investigation, we propose a neurobiological hypothesis of uncertainty monitoring based on the known circuitry of the honey bee&nbsp;brain.&#8221;</p>
<p>That you can&#8217;t remove the concept of uncertainty even from how honeybees make decisions makes me more confident that uncertainty has to be core to any philosophical theory, which is why things like the Trolley Problem as such nonsense: there is no morality that can be reasonably applied to humankind (or beekind) without taking into account&nbsp;uncertainty.</p>

<p>A thought on Worse Is&nbsp;Better:</p>
<p>When we say &#8220;worse is better&#8221; it means we have some attribute we want to optimize for. We have a particular perspective on &#8220;better&#8221;, a lens through which we are viewing a problem. But the attribute we want to optimize is at conflict with something else. And apparently other people care more about this something else than about the thing we care&nbsp;about.</p>
<p>Without much context &#8220;worse is better&#8221; means we believe that other something is out there, we just don&#8217;t know what that something is. But with investigation we should be able to figure out what that something is. And then the result is something specific. And we should turn it into &#8220;X is better than Y, even though I think Y is really important, but apparently no one else&nbsp;agrees.&#8221;</p>
<p>The next step: figure out how X and Y can coexist. Or an alternative: bitch about X and feel superior while no one else wants to use what you&#8217;ve&nbsp;created.</p>

<p>So in the <span class="caps">US</span> (I don&#8217;t know about elsewhere, but would be curious to learn more) there is a tension around parking, density, new development, gentrification, and blah blah urbanist stuff. But anyway, new development typically requires a bunch of private parking. As a result you get condos with built-in parking garages, and this is really expensive. Storing cars densely is surprisingly hard. People who are advocates of more affordable housing, or of more density, or of alternate transportation, really dislike&nbsp;this.</p>
<p>I also saw a breakdown of the effect of mandatory private parking on a typical low-end apartment building, and it was substantial (I wish I could find the video – it was something made for Portland <span class="caps">OR</span> specifically, but the presentation was essentially&nbsp;generic).</p>
<p>At the same time, I understand the frustration of existing residents of popular neighborhoods who see a resource they expected to have access to disappear as parking gets tighter. And I also hate neighborhood parking restrictions, which let residents lay exclusive claim to a public resource at extremely low&nbsp;prices.</p>
<p>But all these tensions don&#8217;t actually exist everywhere. Many cities have lots of areas where parking isn&#8217;t tight. Typically these areas are very residential, but also not in particularly high demand. And I see the streets, and they seem very&nbsp;wasted.</p>
<p>It would seem useful to me to look at actual public/street parking usage, and reduce or eliminate private parking requirements when the parking is underutilized. This doesn&#8217;t really address the most common conflicts, because the common conflicts are for developers that want to build high-end housing in high-demand areas. And they&#8217;ll still have that conflict. But adding some mid-sized apartment buildings without parking to residential neighborhoods is one possible way to get affordable housing, not by shoehorning &#8220;affordability&#8221; into the most desirable neighborhoods, where it is always obviously&nbsp;fake.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not entirely clear to me how much parking adds to the cost of housing when it&#8217;s in an area with cheaper land and surface parking is an option. It might still be substantial, as lots don&#8217;t just open up magically, and so it&#8217;s not the cost of the spot so much as the opportunity cost of losing units to&nbsp;parking.</p>

<p><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>The reason automation won&#8217;t replace a human workforce is because it&#8217;s far easier to program a person than to program a&nbsp;computer.&#8221;</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve never really thought of &#8220;programming a person&#8221; but the concept now seems obvious (i.e., telling a person what to do, and they work autonomously doing it), especially in the employer/employee&nbsp;relationship.</p>
<hr>
<p>An interesting data point, though incomplete. Self-reporting is always just a beginning in understanding a phenomena, though I can&#8217;t think of much in this area that goes beyond&nbsp;self-reporting.</p>
<p>Anyway, what struck me as a common theme throughout what she says in this article is the contrast between external and internal validation. I don&#8217;t know of a path into computer science that can rely on external validation. That&#8217;s intrinsic to being engaged in a craft: you have to engage with the task and skills and domain of the craft on its own terms, form a relationship between you and the thing you are doing, and if you are always glancing up to seek approval for what you are doing you&#8217;ll miss&nbsp;that.</p>
<p>One can identify externally validated niches of <span class="caps">IT</span>, and bringing those niches out into the forefront is often suggested for inclusiveness. But I find that approach disappointing. Everyone needs to be technology literate, but not everyone needs to be able to program a computer. If somebody decides they are not interested in that path, then fine. But to learn a craft, to learn how to make, to pursue mastery, to self-define success – those are the experiences I would want every child to have. If you strip that out to make <span class="caps">IT</span> accessible, then I have lost interest in the&nbsp;experiment.</p>
<p>But of course we do not need to give up on what I would consider the higher pursuit of inclusiveness: not to equalize, but to expand privilege. In this case, I would identify at least one privilege, that technology offers a powerful kind of autonomy not present in mere academic subjects. I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s a controversial statement to assert that girls are more sensitive to external validation than boys – but it would also be absurd to treat girls as slaves to external validation. I am confident the potential exists, though I do not know enough to know where that potential is most likely to exist. There is a further challenge: our most commonly used tools to effect children all rely on external validation. How do you teach something when the teaching itself emphasizes the intellectual approach you are trying to avoid? Still, teaching may be necessary as a sort of scaffolding – but scaffolding to pursue a mental structure that I don&#8217;t know quite how to&nbsp;describe.</p>

<p><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>At home there was a game that all the parents played with their children. It was called, What Did You See? Mara was about Dann’s age when she was first called into her father’s room one evening, where he sat in his big carved and coloured chair. He said to her, ‘And now we are going to play a game. What was the thing you liked best&nbsp;today?’</p>
<p>At first she chattered: ‘I played with my cousin &#8230; I was out with Shera in the garden &#8230; I made a stone house.’ And then he had said, ‘Tell me about the house.’ And she said, ‘I made a house of the stones that come from the river bed.’ And he said, ‘Now tell me about the stones.’ And she said, ‘They were mostly smooth stones, but some were sharp and had different shapes.’ ‘Tell me what the stones looked like, what colour they were, what did they feel&nbsp;like.’</p>
<p>And by the time the game ended she knew why some stones were smooth and some sharp and why they were different colours, some cracked, some so small they were almost sand. She knew how rivers rolled stones along and how some of them came from far away. She knew that the river had once been twice as wide as it was now. There seemed no end to what she knew, and yet her father had not told her much, but kept asking questions so she found the answers in herself. Like, ‘Why do you think some stones are smooth and round and some still sharp?’ And she thought and replied, ‘Some have been in the water a long time, rubbing against other stones, and some have only just been broken off bigger stones.’ Every evening, either her father or her mother called her in for What Did You See? She loved it. During the day, playing outside or with her toys, alone or with other children, she found herself thinking, Now notice what you are doing, so you can tell them tonight what you&nbsp;saw.</p>
<p>She had thought that the game did not change; but then one evening she was there when her little brother was first asked, What Did You See? and she knew just how much the game had changed for her. Because now it was not just What Did You See? but: What were you thinking? What made you think that? Are you sure that thought is&nbsp;true?</p>
<p>When she became seven, not long ago, and it was time for school, she was in a room with about twenty children – all from her family or from the Big Family – and the teacher, her mother’s sister, said, ‘And now the game: What Did You&nbsp;See?’</p>
<p>Most of the children had played the game since they were tiny; but some had not, and they were pitied by the ones that had, for they did not notice much and were often silent when the others said, ‘I saw &#8230;’, whatever it was. Mara was at first upset that this game played with so many at once was simpler, more babyish, than when she was with her parents. It was like going right back to the earliest stages of the game: ‘What did you see?’ ‘I saw a bird.’ ‘What kind of a bird?’ ‘It was black and white and had a yellow beak.’ ‘What shape of beak? Why do you think the beak is shaped like&nbsp;that?’</p>
<p>Then she saw what she was supposed to be understanding: Why did one child see this and the other that? Why did it sometimes need several children to see everything about a stone or a bird or a&nbsp;person?&#8221;</p>

<p>This programming language has some interesting ideas, many of the same ideas that have been running around in my head the last couple months. What he mostly talks about here is using two clear stages to handle typing: an initialization phase where things like classes are defined (but it&#8217;s not limited to a fixed set of things you can define, i.e., it&#8217;s not only classes), and a runtime phase. Static typing comes into play in the runtime phase. It&#8217;s a little like a preprocessor that uses the same language as you use at runtime, which in turn is a little like macros, but then it isn&#8217;t really like either of&nbsp;those.</p>
<p>In my own mind I&#8217;ve been thinking about partial evaluation and simulation to create a more fluid separation between initialization and runtime, where you kind of explore deeper and deeper using both Things You Know For Sure (partial evaluation), and Possible Scenarios, and looping both to see how much you can learn about the program. Or, how much you can teach the programmer about the program they are&nbsp;writing.</p>
<p>But I&#8217;m just imagining these things, Subtext appears to exist. Though without source code one can never be quite&nbsp;sure.</p>
<p>http://www.subtext-lang.org/</p>
<hr>
<p>An older video about a concept that didn&#8217;t quite work out (tried in Subtext, as mentioned earlier:&nbsp;https://plus.google.com/+IanBicking/posts/6VbVjX4cTVx)</p>
<p>So turn-based games usually work by having player 1 play, then player 2, and so on. But there&#8217;s another category where everyone plays their turn at once, and no one goes before or after anyone else. The idea presented here is: what if a program was written like that? Instead of a list of instructions to move through, you implicitly doing everything at once. In the case of a game this changes how the rules are defined – you probably don&#8217;t move pieces, instead you indicate where you would like them to go, and there is conflict resolution. Or your game is arranged so there are no &#8220;conflicts&#8221; and all possible combinations of what people do are legal. That might even be two phrases for the same concept: either way you are embracing the fact that actions progress conditional only on the past state, and do not take into account the result of those&nbsp;actions.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not actually clear what the programming language that did this would look like in a practical case. Would the normal concepts we use (if, for, assignment, function calls) be a good fit? Would there be entirely new control structures? Maybe the tricky part is you can&#8217;t do it even if you wanted&nbsp;to.</p>

source code. Either it&#8217;s an interpreted language, or the byte-code/binary format has a copy of the full source code. Perhaps that source code is encrypted and needs to be unlocked for full debugging to keep the source safe for non-open-source code. I&#8217;ve wished in the past that Java had developed a convention of bundling the source into jar files by default.

Not sure how the language itself would enable this, but the ability to rewind instructions would occasionally be very valuable. Stack traces are typically used to answer the &#8220;How did I get here?&#8221; question, but being able to rewind and then walk it again would be invaluable.

Again, not necessarily a language feature (it might be done by the compiler or handled by the runtime) but seeing the lineage of the data stored in a variable. For example, variable X was set as a product of Y and Z at location L, Y came from W at line M, and Z came from blah and line R, etc. A dependency chain for data.

+Shannon Posniewski - I like your lineage comment. In my app, we have a few generic data structures where we store <em><span class="caps">FILE</span></em> and <em><span class="caps">LINE</span></em> of the caller at create time in the debug build via a macro. It&#8217;s extremely valuable for root-causing memory leaks.

+Shannon Posniewski: a stack trace with local variables (ala paste.evalexception, and common though less well exposed in debuggers) should give you the callback. But in languages that use callbacks a lot, it seems like there is a missing stacktrace, usually along the lines of how did this callback get registered? E.g., in Javascript if you do &#8220;setTimeout(func)&#8221; then there won&#8217;t be any stack trace there&#8217;s a problem in func(), but you&#8217;d probably like the stack trace at the time you called setTimeout(). Maybe this could be thought of in terms of the lineage of the callback, akin to other data lineage&#8230;?

Debug logging (and other directives) that can be selectively or completely ignored by the interpreter/compiler so that there is no performance hit for including them in the code unless you enable the logging. It should be something better than Java/Log4J&#8217;s &#8220;ifDebugEnabled()&#8221;, which really just leaves the block in place and skips over it&#8212;more like an #<span class="caps">IFDEF</span> that makes the code invisible when we don&#8217;t want it active.

I think just being able to build expected inputs and expected outputs really easily would be helpful. E.g. in python it&#8217;s usually really easy e.g. nums = [2, 4, 15], factors = [(2), (2, 2), (3, 5)] could be inputs and outputs.
However if the language had some sense of which inputs are edge cases (e.g. perhaps 0 should be in the nums array). Then perhaps it could assist more.

I think that if you wanted a language that is easy to debug, as opposed to runtime environment that provides useful debugging tools, you need to give up the idea of using the language to describe a procedure to follow &#8212; instead have a (preferrably domain-specific) language that lets you describe the desired output, preferrably in a way that doesn&#8217;t involve any internal state. Then the &#8220;program&#8221; becomes as trivial to debug as the notation used is easy to read. No need to trace it, no need to check for intermediate states. You just get your&nbsp;solution.</p>
<p>Examples of such languages include the regular expressions (the mathematical ones, not Perl&#8217;s), the <span class="caps">BNF</span> notation for grammars, the lambda calculus, and of course the Prolog language (arguably, debugging Prolog is not that easy, but I blame the&nbsp;notation).</p>
<p>In a more general fashion, the more state changes you disallow, the easier the language will be to debug. First, disallow self-modifying code, altering the syntax of language at runtime (hello, Perl), dynamic definition of functions and types, macros, C++ templates. Next come globals and all other non-local variables, closures and variable references and pointers &#8212; that should give you no side effects at the function level. Next is removing polymorphism and function pointers, so that when you see a function or method call in the code, you know exactly which code gets called. Next is removing assignment &#8212; only allow to define new variables, not change the existing ones. Lastly, and that probably makes it non-turing, remove conditionals &#8212; at this point you have a nice, static, definition language. Of course you might want to stop at any intermediate level depending what you need the language for.

+Ian Bicking You mentioned &#8220;debuggable&#8221; instead of &#8220;bug avoidance&#8221; and at that point I think it&#8217;s obvious it&#8217;s the wrong goal. Just like the fastest code is one that never runs, the most debuggable code is one without bugs.

For those interested in rewinding operations: have a look at factor lang&#8230; the default environment lets you do just that (I played with it, but I haven&#8217;t done something really&nbsp;meaningful)</p>
<p>About debuggability vs bug avoidance: I love haskell, but even programs written in it can have bugs, thus a debugger can always be&nbsp;useful</p>
<p>Also, recently I was criticized because I needed to debug some (inherited) code I was working on&#8230; the test suite was comprehensive, but the guy complained that &#8220;I shouldn&#8217;t need debugging if I had unit&nbsp;tests&#8221;</p>
<p>Too bad that, as granular as your unit test might be, you can&#8217;t foresee every way in which a program could fail, thus obtaining test assertions that might not actually yield information good enough to understand where things went&nbsp;wrong</p>
<p>This can happen even with &#8216;trivial&#8217; internal state&#8230; especially when compilers or interpreters changed some assumptions in the meanwhile </rant>

Also programs that are by some definition &#8220;correct&#8221; still need to be debugged, because our definition of correct may itself be incorrect. Debuggability is the ability to figure out why a program does what it does and to determine how to change that.

+Dario Bertini : When I first started unit testing, I shunned the debugger, mostly because I could. Over the past few years, I&#8217;ve noticed that sometimes the debugger is the most efficient way to figure out what&#8217;s going on—if I run unit tests under it. Then things I observe in the debugger suggest new tests. They complement each other&nbsp;nicely.</p>

Visual data and state tracing, with the ability to make immutable data and state runs (kind of like a log, but more like version control for registers, for start-to-end replay). Machine execution states should always be mapped to original (human readable) code positions, of&nbsp;course.</p>
<p>I also like the idea of a sort of doctest where programmers are required to state all known edge cases and average use cases for a given functional block, with expected input and output ranges. This would allow automatic edge and center-point test runs at first compile time. This would also allow for automatic assertion or error handling at run&nbsp;time.</p>
<p>All modern network-able applications should always include an option to automatically report errors back to the builder&#8217;s repository, to be added to future continuous deployment test runs. This would require a known version controlled binary-to-code map for all released versions.

Consider when you deeply couple state, identity and behavior, you end up needing really good debugging tools. Or, in this case the need to &#8220;design a programming language for debuggability&#8221;. Most mainstream languages are like this. Python. Ruby. <span class="caps">PHP</span>, JavaScript, Java, C++, C#. They all link these things together. Some more so than&nbsp;others.</p>
<p>Coupling these things makes it intrinsically difficult to debug programs written this way, because it&#8217;s inherently difficult to assert the program&#8217;s correctness in the first place. You must test each method of that object in all of its internal states, plus all the states of all its dependencies. Asserting the correctness of the object in one state helps you almost not at all with asserting the correctness of it in other states. So you can kinda see that programs written with these coupled concepts often contain a lot of incidental complexity, Which is to say they contain complexity that&#8217;s non-essential to the problem at&nbsp;hand.</p>
<p>But these three concepts really rarely should be coupled. Or at least the language should move you in the direction of not needing to when the problem doesn&#8217;t require it. Lisps and Smalltalk are like this.

+Nick Bauman : Smalltalk is more coupled than nearly any other language I can think of! (And also the most designed for&nbsp;debugging)</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not so sure this complexity isn&#8217;t inherent in the problem being solved. The very idea of &#8220;correctness&#8221; is to select a small subset of problem domains. I&#8217;m interested in the domain of applications, and I don&#8217;t believe correctness as a concept offers much there - certainly the robustness of the components is helpful, but being correct is neither necessary not enough to ensure a working assembly of those components. Debuggability speaks to the productive momentum of the developer, which for many domains is more essential.

Substitute correctness with &#8220;robust enoughness&#8221; and what I&#8217;m saying still holds.

+Radomir Dopieralski Wait, wait, did you just call out regular expressions as being easy to debug? What universe do you live in, and can I move there?&nbsp;:-)</p>
<p>In my experience, non-trivial regular expressions are always the most difficult thing to debug in a function, especially if I&#8217;m not the one who&#8217;s written them. Now you can argue that this is due to regular expression syntax being complicated, but the fact that we haven&#8217;t already come up with a regexp syntax that&#8217;s both simple and powerful enough for real world use means that constructing such a syntax is a non-trivial&nbsp;exercise.</p>
<p>Speaking to your broader point, I haven&#8217;t found declarative languages (regular expressions, <span class="caps">BNF</span> grammars, <span class="caps">SQL</span> queries, etc.) to be any easier to debug than more traditional functions. If anything, what ends up happening is that I write out a function that would execute the declarative expression (e.g. <span class="caps">DFA</span> in the case of regex) and debug that instead of trying to debug the declarative statement directly.

+Rohit Patnaik you are right, I blame the notation, and also the difficulty of forcing our brains to thinking in terms of rigid rules. But the latter is inherent in all technology and can&#8217;t really be improved. I see your point that seeing how the code is executed can make it easier to understand &#8212; a language, that sort of explains itself. But note, that this additional &#8220;explaining&#8221; is only required because the notation for regular expressions, <span class="caps">SQL</span> or prolog programs is generalised, and we need a lot of effort to translate it from our particular domain (like an e-mail address to match) to the generalised language (like the pattern that matches the e-mail address). A more domain-specific language could help greatly.

I&#8217;ll second (third, fourth) the call for &#8220;reversability&#8221;.

<p>What I&#8217;ve always thought would be cool would be to hook one of those driving game controllers (you know, the ones with the steering wheels / gas-pedals) to the debugger, and be able to drive through my program, putting my foot down to accelerate through the boring parts, slowing for the dodgy corners, going into reverse (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omniscient_Debugger) when I crash into something.

Man, what a great&nbsp;question!</p>
<p>To make a language that&#8217;s easy to debug, I guess you should work backward from the debugger. What are visualizations of behavior and state that people understand the most readily? A few come to mind: timelines, graphs, tables, flowcharts. So make a language whose semantics all map to&nbsp;those.</p>
<p>For example, make visiting the nodes on a graph or items in a list a primitive operation. Coordinate computation in a way that&#8217;s analogous to laying events out on a timeline. These kinds of things will make it so that when you open a debugger, you see something that immediately resembles what you had in your head.

By the way, I think a lot of the people from earlier in this thread would be interested in a debugger I&#8217;m working on for JavaScript:&nbsp;https://github.com/adobe-research/theseus</p>
<p>It&#8217;s omniscient enough that it lets you debug retroactively (with compromises), and it treats async calls like direct calls when it constructs call trees (which I&#8217;ve found matches peoples&#8217; mental models pretty darn well).

<p><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>The policy failure here is the lack of peak-period pricing (and secondarily location-specific pricing) that would ration scarce capacity. Instead we move to a ‘predict and provide’ mode, and where we fail to provide, we ration by&nbsp;queueing.&#8221;</p>
<p>Thinking a bit about this: is there a rational social/economic reason for rationing via queuing (i.e., making people sit in traffic) instead of variable pricing (or any pricing at&nbsp;all)?</p>
<p>And I think there is. Free roads, offered to the point of traffic gridlock, are a form of progressive pricing. A wealthy person values their time, in terms of dollars, higher than a poor person. And a poor person values their dollar, in terms of time, higher than a wealthy person. When we are rationing a resource with a queue (i.e., time) we are finding a relatively fair way to ration it among people of different class. And after all, it is a public good – road infrastructure, like other public goods, belong to people equally as individuals, not according to their&nbsp;wealth.</p>
<p>This would actually be okay, except that money is a much more efficient way to ration things, because it is a transfer, where queuing rations according to how much each person is willing to&nbsp;waste.</p>
<p>I think this opens up a technological and political challenge: how can we ration public resources in a way that does not incur waste, but also is offered fairly regardless of personal wealth? Note that in this case I think we actually already do a decent job of offering these resources fairly, we just don&#8217;t do it&nbsp;efficiently.</p>

<p>Listening to an interview with Rich Tafel, the founder of the Log Cabin Republicans (the gay Republican lobby group), I was struck by his comment on environmentalism – specifically that environmentalists have missed an opportunity by not advocating from the&nbsp;Right.</p>
<p>And relatedly, I think gay marriage advocacy is something that demands deep thought by activists in other areas. The tipping point has been particularly dramatic, but it&#8217;s not just that they reached 51% and everything changed – the advances have been real and&nbsp;significant.</p>
<p>I have a friend (gay) who was feeling annoyed with the public advocacy campaign in Minnesota leading up to a referendum. The ads seldom had gay people in them, and were fairly conservative in nature. They were deliberately non-threatening and excluded even the most oblique reference to sexuality. This was all based on market studies, and was a strategy shared across the 2012&nbsp;campaigns.</p>
<p>But hey, it was a winning strategy. And I think in a sense it won from the Right. Not that the people behind it were conservatives, but the campaign was directed at the conservative end of the spectrum of convincibles It makes obvious sense to do so. It specifically did not confront unrelated beliefs. It did not talk about non-traditional families. It did not ask people to consider what it felt like to see two people of the same sex kissing. It did not ask what is marriage? It was simple. It was the strategy of people who wanted to win, not people who wanted to be right while they&nbsp;lost.</p>
<p>I see in modern activist strategies an embarrassment of people who are more concerned about being right than doing right. And always with a whole constellation of issues – even though, like a constellation, they are often just a random scattering of lights whose pattern is just an agreed-upon delusion. And of course I have my own constellation of issues, and I try to make sense of them as a whole. But I don&#8217;t think this is a good basis for organizing, strength through solidarity is not as powerful as strength through&nbsp;strength.</p>

<p>A thought in favor of True Cost environmentalism (that is, that we should factor in externalities into the cost of all&nbsp;items)&#8230;</p>
<p>Well, maybe I have a thought in opposition to moralizing environmentalism – the idea that we should do certain things because it is Right For The Environmental, well exemplified by nearly any case where the label &#8220;green&#8221; is&nbsp;used.</p>
<p>Underlying the moralist view is the support of full employment. That is, it is considered the job of environmentalist policies to protect and support not just the environment, but also that everyone should have a job and an equivalent&nbsp;lifestyle.</p>
<p>It is not entirely apparent that this is the case, because it only appears in how the environmental effect of something is calculated. Moralist calculations always leave out labor, even tout labor as a feature. This means that the environmental burden of that person existing, and their labor being dedicated to one thing instead of another, is not calculated into the cost of an item. This makes sense if you believe that labor is in some sense environmentally free – because no one is advocating population reduction, and no one is advocating deprivation, and so you can imagine there&#8217;s just a big pool of labor that has to be used on something, unattached to the environmental cost of that labor, which you would consider&nbsp;fixed.</p>
<p>And it is fine and well that you want everyone to have a job, and that you want no deprivation, but that is not environmentalism. It also leads to a situation where there can be really expensive stuff that is &#8220;green&#8221; because we&#8217;ve willfully ignored many aspects of how that stuff is created. Like, does the person who manufactures it drink Starbucks coffee, supported by storefronts and barristas, or do they brew their own coffee? It&#8217;s absurd to try to enumerate the environmental impact of every choice a laborer makes, but there is a real difference in the impact of a good based on the cup of coffee that laborer&nbsp;drinks.</p>
<p>Which gets us back to True Cost Pricing – the one way we can actually account for all those costs. I literally cannot think of any other possible way to account for the environmental impacts of our objects and actions. And if we can&#8217;t account for those costs how can we possibly act in a sensible way toward the&nbsp;environment?</p>

<p>An article on recent reform math curriculum, and its deemphasis of learning the standard algorithms by rote (e.g., how to add two numbers on&nbsp;paper).</p>
<p>The article is too abstract to really be helpful though, as I think it is missing the concrete pedagogical concerns that drive the reform. And there&#8217;s also a meta-reform, which is how do you arrange curriculum so that teachers actually teach it as intended? It&#8217;s this latter concern that I am guessing causes the standard algorithm to not even appear until later years, so that it cannot be&nbsp;overemphasized.</p>
<p>Though it doesn&#8217;t set up a strawman, the article talks too much about inspiring original thought in children. My feeling is that encouraging kids to use multiple algorithms to do fundamental mathematical operations – including those of their own invention – is to help them assimilate the concepts of math. That a+b equals b+a is something you want children to understand intuitively, not rationally. Even that a<em>(b+c) equals (a</em>b)+(a*c) is something that should be amenable to intuition. A single rote algorithm won&#8217;t lead a kid to that understanding. Some kids figure it out without instruction – but only because they play with the concepts naturally. That said, I don&#8217;t think there&#8217;s one path to assimilation. Which everyone knows – that&#8217;s why we have human teachers and not computers, so they can engage with the cognition of individual students. In some ways the difference really is goals – under both curriculums there are challenges and multiple techniques to approach those challenges. I would worry that rote algorithms can become an end to themselves, even though they aren&#8217;t that interesting. And the algorithms tend to be optimized for precision and managing the details compactly, not for their pedagogical&nbsp;utility.</p>

<p>Listening to an EconTalk podcast with Bruce Schneier, talking about privacy and companies (this talk just slightly preceded Snowden) and thinking of other similar critiques (e.g., http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evgeny_Morozov) I generally find myself unimpressed with the analysis. I haven&#8217;t figured out even how to quite describe my feelings. A guilty&nbsp;ennui?</p>
<p>I think what has made it hard for me to articulate is that my problem is with the analytical process, not so much the conclusions. And the framing itself – because I don&#8217;t like the framing I can&#8217;t disagree or agree with the conclusions, leaving me feeling deeply&nbsp;dissatisfied.</p>
<p>Tonight I had a thought though. To me it is analogous to Intelligent Design vs. Evolutionary Theory. Not the argument between those two, but the effect they have on a worldview. I have no interest in hearing theories of biology by people who believe in Intelligent Design. The metaphors are all wrong, cause and effect is&nbsp;inverted.</p>
<p>When I think about &#8220;the market&#8221; or &#8220;corporations&#8221; or &#8220;incentives&#8221; or &#8220;the government&#8221; I see them as ecologies, I see change as evolution. This is not much of a simplification, because ecologies and evolution are complex things, and after decades I still put forward real effort to assimilate those concepts. The concepts are fractal, self-repeating at different scales, but also revealing unique patterns at each&nbsp;scale.</p>
<p>There are ecologies of institutions, and ecologies within institutions. &#8220;If you&#8217;re not paying for the product, you are the product.&#8221; In the context of the ecology this assertion sounds more like &#8220;if you aren&#8217;t the predator you are the prey&#8221; – but that&#8217;s not how nature works, even though it&#8217;s a very compelling (and flattering) notion that there is a top and a bottom to the food&nbsp;chain.</p>
<p>I feel culturally (even professionally) aligned with people who see conspiracies in every institution, but I can&#8217;t help feeling that they are like toddlers that see a face in every rock. And it&#8217;s hard, because I feel like being opposed to these analysis put me on the other side, which isn&#8217;t where I want to be either. Like I must choose to be an alchemist or priest&#8230; when I really want to be a&nbsp;scientist.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve been riding and thinking and griping about buses lately. While this notion of free buses has seemed very appealing to me in the past, I&#8217;m less&nbsp;sure.</p>
<p>Even right now, I feel like a major problem with buses is that they really don&#8217;t need or even want customers. Customers are a liability. Fares don&#8217;t cover expenses. Political capital is useful, but indirect, and bus systems have lost most customers that might provide political&nbsp;capital.</p>
<p>My bus system isn&#8217;t particularly bad. The drivers are okay, but mostly they just don&#8217;t want any trouble. The bureaucracy has smoothed out certain edges. The buses are clean. But the crowded bus lines stay crowded, until they get further out then they become empty and useless. Lines don&#8217;t evolve, they aren&#8217;t adjusted, there&#8217;s no attempt to maximize ridership. They can&#8217;t experiment with pricing; really they can&#8217;t do much of anything without approval from a political structure that doesn&#8217;t much care about buses. Customers don&#8217;t fit into any&nbsp;equation.</p>
<p>Oh, and did I mention they are slow? Buses are so terribly painfully incredible slow that only people who place very little value in their own time can justify being on a bus. Door-to-door times on a bus range from 2x a car to 6x, often walking speed, almost never faster than biking. But as time goes on the buses just get&nbsp;slower.</p>
<p>Making buses free maybe could help. It might draw customers who actually have a way of effecting positive operational change through the political process. It might diversify the ridership in a way that positively effects social standards of civility on buses. I certainly wouldn&#8217;t fight it, but it&#8217;s a long&nbsp;shot.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m not sure if this article is pessimistic or optimistic. On the one hand, it seems kids don&#8217;t learn programming very easily, and when they appear to have learned programming they often have just become very good at imitating and iterating program examples. But if you are interested in not just the skill of programming, but also the complementary skills and underlying concepts that might come from programming, then it being easy isn&#8217;t necessary. That is, if truly learning programming requires some big and challenging mental leaps, then that might imply that learning programming is all the more&nbsp;important.</p>

<p>One of the thinking points when I consider code design, and as a positive feature, is locality of effect. Which I don&#8217;t think is a formal term (except in quantum mechanics), but it&#8217;s the only one I got for the idea. An extension of that that I&#8217;ve just been thinking about is locality of expectation. How well does a piece of code express everything necessary to make the code successfully execute? The finer the grain the better – at the largest scale this is stuff like what needs to be installed, what services need to be up, etc. Then you can move down to libraries, modules, functions, methods, each to greater&nbsp;effect.</p>
<p>Unit testing helps here, but to go a bit further you might ask: how hard is it to write an invalid unit test? But to look at it that way you have to split the unit test into two parts: action and confirmation. You can easily write invalid confirmations, e.g., &#8220;assertEqual(3+4, 10)&#8221; – and you can think of exceptions and other failures as kinds of confirmations. But ignoring confirmation, how certain can you be of the validity of&nbsp;actions?</p>

<p>There&#8217;s all sorts of digital dysfunctions we worry about: are we too distracted, spending too much time in front of the screen, more polarized, more obsessive, are we worse off because of&nbsp;technology?</p>
<p>This is the standard romantic perspective on modern problems, and the romantic interpretation is also the standard interpretation – it&#8217;s ubiquitous enough that the interpretation goes without&nbsp;saying.</p>
<p>The opposite approach, I think, is to view problems as explorations. When you finally make your way through the wilderness and across a ridge, you see only more struggle before you: yet another ridge, yet more brush. But you don&#8217;t weep because that is why you are exploring, to find the next&nbsp;challenge.</p>
<p>The digital era is to say the era when we looked creatively and explored intensely the idea of knowledge, truth, connection. (And where those explorations have landed us is a value shift from objective knowledge to situational knowledge; but I digress.) This is not true just on a societal scale, but exploded to an individual level, with all of us actively and assertively making critical choices that shape the transmission of&nbsp;information.</p>
<p>And we&#8217;ve explored, and we&#8217;ve gotten somewhere. It will take great effort to make it through the brush and over the next ridge, and we must be careful not to get lost (we should not ignore our challenges!) but this is what it is to explore, this is modernism. The dysfunctions we encounter are proof that we are exploring new territory, they are challenges, not just signs we went down the wrong&nbsp;path.</p>
<p>Anyway, this is what I&#8217;ll try to think about when piece of journalism about the perils of technology in our modern age. Which isn&#8217;t to dismiss the problems – but not to worry so much about whether those problems prove our modern times to be better or worse. I don&#8217;t think we should revert the changes we&#8217;ve made to the world, but more importantly I know we can&#8217;t revert those changes. The question of should is moot. So why worry about it? Time moves forward, we don&#8217;t control if it does, but we do control how it&nbsp;does.</p>

<p>An interesting perspective. And in a sense it points to what Columbus actually accomplished, which is a valid and significant achievement, distinct from Native Americans or Viking explorers or others. Columbus&#8217;s discovery was the one that finally&nbsp;stuck.</p>

<p>This is a somewhat bizarre but interesting argument: technology (in education) is a chance to get people to improve without telling them they need improvement. That is, teachers (or institutions or whatever) that could improve but do not, are given an excuse to improve through the &#8220;change&#8221; of technology – even if that change is not essential to the improvement. Like drawing someone out into the beginner&#8217;s mind by putting them off balance (and technology is great at putting people off balance), and then once they&#8217;ve entered that state hoping they pick up more than they expected. So technology may or may not improve education, but the very act of pursuing and critically thinking about technology in education will improve&nbsp;education.</p>

<p>Reading a discussion of transit subsidies and global warming and all that jazz I thought: I bet a Hayekian critique of environmentalism through regulation would be interesting. But looking for such a thing, it all seemed to point to Free-market Environmentalism (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free-market_environmentalism) which is not that interesting, more like yet another libertarian&nbsp;fantasy.</p>
<p>It seems to me that correct pricing is an essential basis to an environmentally responsible economy, but free-market environmentalism is all focused on liabilities and contracts – things that could ultimately show up in prices, but in order to achieve that there&#8217;s many levels of law and government and science that have to be surmounted first that it seems quite hopeless, and would be unclear at any stage if progress was actually being&nbsp;made.</p>

<p>I think an intuitive sense of probability and reliability doesn&#8217;t play enough part in the theory of how people make decisions. The Trolley Paradox is an example of this (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trolley_problem) whereby philosophers tie themselves in knots for no good reason. They all come down to various kinds of &#8220;do nothing and N people die, do something and 1 person dies&#8221; and then puzzle at why people don&#8217;t always choose the greater good. But it&#8217;s all based on hypothetical questions which cannot be related to our actual ethical thinking processes, which all deal with the real&nbsp;world.</p>
<p>We are biased towards inaction because we just don&#8217;t know how good we are at knowing what the good choice is. If I leave the switch 4 people die, if I move it 1 person dies&#8230; who am I to say what this switch does? Maybe there&#8217;s a reason it&#8217;s there. Maybe the train won&#8217;t go where I think it will. Maybe this is all an elaborate ruse (which in fact it is). There&#8217;s no degree of confidence that can be absolute, because we always must take into account the chance that we are&nbsp;crazy.</p>
<p>If anyone got it into their mind that sacrificing one life to save many was good, and that they were morally empowered and even required to take action on that knowledge, then we&#8217;d have a lot more people killing politicians, we&#8217;d have sane people making these kinds of actions. But sane people know that we cannot never fully trust even our most foundational sense of truth. So when you stretch ethical questions beyond what we regularly practice, people become conservative, they act to reduce the effect of their actions instead of steering their actions toward any end. And I think that&#8217;s quite objectively&nbsp;rational.</p>
<p>(I just got to thinking because of this seemingly obscure comment saying that risk aversion makes a person take \$100k/year instead of 0.1% chance of a billion dollars: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5411775 – with similar logic I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s risk aversion so much as a rational adjustment of probability to take into account flaws in how we calculate&nbsp;probability.)</p>

<p>This article is interesting but also quite pessimistic about Japanese Culture. Maybe I can paraphrase the observation from the five-part&nbsp;piece:</p>
<p>As wealth and actual numbers of youth in Japan has decreased, mainstream culture has become stagnant, starved of (consumer) interest from what would otherwise be the trendsetters of today. It&#8217;s kind of the normal death of mainstream media/culture that we&#8217;re seeing elsewhere, but without the same kinds of replacement culture (e.g., internet culture). But while there&#8217;s been mainstream contraction, marginal groups have maintained their cultural engagement and consumption, as for them their cultural connection to the group is a priority in their lives. This has resulted in these marginal groups gaining a larger share of overall culture, even though in absolute terms there&#8217;s no real increase. It&#8217;s easy to see this as the marginal groups influencing mainstream culture, but this might just be the desperate hope of brands looking for the Next Big Thing, when in fact there&#8217;s no next big thing on the horizon. And the cultural output from these marginal groups is generally unsuitable (and unattractive) to any audience outside Japan (especially since it&#8217;s unclear that it is particularly attractive to a broad audience inside&nbsp;Japan).</p>
<p>This is sad, Japan has had a lot of wonderful cultural exports, and we are better for it. But when I finished the piece it occurred to me that I can&#8217;t think of any important new cultural phenomena from Japan in the last decade. Even the aren&#8217;t-the-Japanese-crazy clips are feeling rehashed, it&#8217;s just the same&nbsp;crazy.</p>
<p>Though it&#8217;s mostly an aside to the article, there are some very biting insights about the otaku (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otaku). One example that seems to frustrate the author is one of the &#8220;biggest&#8221; bands in Japan right now is <span class="caps">AKB48</span>: &#8220;Compared to past mass market groups such as Speed, the girls are intentionally chosen and styled to look like elementary schoolgirls and lyrically address older men with direct sexual references&#8221; (video reference: <span class="caps">AKB48</span> - Seifuku ga Jama wo Suru (English&nbsp;Subs))</p>
<p>On the other hand Korea seems like the up and comer from all fronts. Are the Japanese freaked out about Korea like we were freaked out about Japan in the&nbsp;80s?</p>

<p>A corollary to this article: at least for the purpose of education maybe we should consider &#8220;programming&#8221; to mean &#8220;doing something that leads to bugs&#8221; - for instance, handwriting <span class="caps">HTML</span> and <span class="caps">CSS</span> qualifies, for instance. But add in a fancy <span class="caps">WYSIWYG</span> editor and it doesn&#8217;t&nbsp;anymore.</p>
<p>Then we might ask: by removing tools are we just inviting bugs? If we took a word processor and added painful/dangerous features with hidden state, would it suddenly become more educational? I think there&#8217;s an answer to this, but it probably needs to be thought about explicitly if you are exploring the boundary. Is assembly more educational because there are more opportunities for&nbsp;bugs?</p>

<p>I wonder that every medium should have an equivalent of the utterance &#8220;uh huh&#8221; or the nod of the head – the way of saying just &#8220;I hear&nbsp;you.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was a period, just a few years I think, when they were compressing long-distance phone calls and replacing almost-silence with true silence. You couldn&#8217;t tell if the phone call was dropped, if the person was still on the other side of the call, it drove people to say &#8220;are you still there?&#8221; all too often. Online we&#8217;ve compressed away all these subtle cues, so they have to be actively reintroduced and&nbsp;reinvented.</p>

<p>A video comparing different instructional styles, Khan Academy, and what I&#8217;ll call a problem-first vs. technique-first&nbsp;approach.</p>
<p>I appreciate the critique: we should be introducing problems that are on the edge of student&#8217;s ability, and letting them confront the problem using what they know. We shouldn&#8217;t be introducing a technique for solving a problem and then giving students a bunch of equivalent problems. Handily, what Michael proposes would be an easy supplement to Khan Academy – the instructional videos are just as useful, but it would be another progression of videos that are problem-oriented rather than technique-oriented, but would still rely on the technique&nbsp;videos.</p>
<p>(I did get a little annoyed with +Michael Pershan&#8217;s use of aggregated educational outcome statistics as a justification – I don&#8217;t think there&#8217;s anything clear lesson from those numbers, just about every potential danger in interpreting causality from statistics is present in those&nbsp;numbers.)</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve been thinking about Aaron Swartz more and more as the day goes on. I didn&#8217;t know him. We met once, had lunch at the Golden Angel, talked as I remember it about <span class="caps">OLPC</span> and a project idea he had about academic publishing&#8230; I&#8217;ve entirely forgotten the details of the idea. I always thought I should try to connect with him more, that I should try to offer some support in light of his legal troubles, that my sister&#8217;s legal troubles at least offered me some sense of what he might be going through; I don&#8217;t know if I offered my sister the support she needed, I don&#8217;t know if I&#8217;d have had anything to offer Aaron, but at least some aspect of it seemed&#8230;&nbsp;relevant?</p>
<p>There&#8217;s these future plans you have, a sense of who is out there, of opportunities missed and found&#8230; and even though I didn&#8217;t know Aaron he was always in the corner of my mind, and opportunity to connect in waiting, an affinity to be found. But it&#8217;s not out there now, no opportunity, no potential. For me it is but a small corner darkened, but I sense that the reaction we&#8217;re seeing is this darkening multiplied out by a great&nbsp;number.</p>
<p>I watched half of Harold <span class="amp">&amp;</span> Maude yesterday, half tonight. In some weird way it seems like the fantasy of the living in the face of suicide. I have in the past found myself drawn to the anti-explanation of suicide: if you have nothing to live for, why not do anything? (For one to find comfort in this, one must ignore Newtown and whatever the next Newtown will be.) I&#8217;ve felt depressed, but never suicidal; as morose as it is, I can only find empathy through imagination. This to me is empathy: to imagine everyone, a skill I am only very slowly acquiring. And over time I realize it&#8217;s not freedom before the final act, but burden. We can&#8217;t unmake ourselves. That is why Newtown is not typical, but instead very atypical; we are until the end ourselves, which is in many ways good, and perhaps in all ways right, and yet it can also be&nbsp;doom.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve checked into Hacker News many times today, which is a kind of log of the sentiment around Aaron&#8217;s death. I have seen a growing (but probably fragile) sentiment of anger for Aaron&#8217;s persecutor, I imagine starting with this post:&nbsp;http://lessig.tumblr.com/post/40347463044/prosecutor-as-bully</p>
<p>In this at least I find I have some opinion. There is a strong sentiment I see in comment threads that the system is broken, not the individual (in this case the individual identified is Carmen Ortiz, not the prosecutor for this case, but the head of the office). Fuck this blame-the-system shit. That&#8217;s Waterfall thinking. Depersonalize the offense until no one is to blame, and nothing will happen. To depersonalize it is to ignore the discretion of individuals, but even more so to ignore the personal incentives that drive the system. To ignore individuals is simply bad analysis, a call to&nbsp;inaction.</p>
<p>Will people be able to get Ortiz fired? Unlikely. With my sister Susan Gaertner was the equivalent figure, heading the office that was pursuing absurd charges. She still has her job, it was never up for question. But I will at least offer this positive story: the people who supported my sister and the <span class="caps">RNC</span> 8 killed Gaertner&#8217;s gubernatorial run. In this case they did it by picketing any public appearances she made, until she started being a chronic no-show and then dropped out. It was never admitted, I don&#8217;t think it even showed up in the news, and probably she never could have actually become governor anyway, but I&#8217;m confident those protests did it, and it hurt Gaertner, and the blow was well deserved. The tools and the people here are different; the case is less absurd, but the people angered are greater in number and power. Anyway, a&nbsp;thought.</p>

<p>I should use a better note-taking&nbsp;system.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve realized this for a while, I have a lot of ad hoc things to remember now. Text editors aren&#8217;t working well, the granularity of notes are too small, the retrieval doesn&#8217;t match&nbsp;files.</p>
<p>Then I was listening to this podcast, part one where they talk to +Thad Starner (around 14:30): http://www.npr.org/programs/invisibilia/385792677/our-computers-ourselves – and he talks about the Rememberance Agent (http://alumni.media.mit.edu/~rhodes/Papers/remembrance.html), where as you enter notes, the agent shows you past notes that have related&nbsp;terms.</p>
<p>Thad talks about this all in the context of wearable computing, but working remotely, at least as far as work is concerned, I always have my laptop with me as I work. Including during all conversations. So it seems sufficiently ubiquitous. And indeed it&#8217;s the notes about people that feel most valuable to me – what did we talk about last, when else have I referred to this person I am now talking to,&nbsp;etc.</p>
<p>Any simple tools I might start with? (I keep being reminded of http://tiddlywiki.com but haven&#8217;t yet tried&nbsp;it.)</p>

<p>An excellent review/takedown of a <span class="caps">TED</span> book, that speaks to the larger trends among &#8220;futurists&#8221; (and a lot of <span class="caps">TED</span>).</p>
<p>The reviewer notes that these sorts really like the word &#8220;increasingly.&#8221; It is suddenly clear that should be a watch word: if you see &#8220;increasingly&#8221; you are about to be introduced to some baseless journalism about &#8220;trends.&#8221; Or to quote: This is a world in which pundits are increasingly using the word “increasingly” whenever they feel too lazy to look up the actual statistics, which, in the Khannas’ case, increasingly means all the&nbsp;time.</p>
<p>Other&nbsp;quotes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To return to Harry Frankfurt, the key distinction between the liar and the bullshitter is that the former conceals “that he is attempting to lead us away from a correct apprehension of reality,” whereas the latter conceals that he is not interested in reality at all. The bullshitter “does not care whether the things he says describe reality correctly. He just picks them out, or makes them up, to suit his&nbsp;purpose.”</p>
<p>Today <span class="caps">TED</span> is an insatiable kingpin of international meme laundering—a place where ideas, regardless of their quality, go to seek celebrity, to live in the form of videos, tweets, and now&nbsp;e-books.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I really like <span class="caps">TED</span> at first, but must admit that I am terribly bored by it lately. The article discusses a lot of the reason I find increasingly uninteresting. Though it&#8217;s also no longer even&nbsp;entertaining.</p>

<p>nspired by an email discussion about games to teach youngish kids to program, I have an idea I&#8217;m kind of excited&nbsp;about:</p>
<p>The Human Computer vs The Human&nbsp;Programmer</p>
<p>In this non-competitive game, the adult plays the part of &#8220;computer&#8221; or &#8220;robot&#8221; and the child (or children) is the&nbsp;programmer.</p>
<p><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>Programs&#8221; are made up of of a sequence of cards. The game comes with cards (probably small cardboard squares) with many different commands. Conditionals might be paired cards: &#8220;if X, goto other card&#8221; (or perhaps move down vs. left from the card based on a&nbsp;condition).</p>
<p>What kind of program do you make? The game also comes with a small board. There is a playing piece, the robot that is being moved around; the adult controls this piece based on the program that the child writes. The board is reconfigurable, with different obstacles and goals. Maybe it is a fire-fighting robot (that also must save a kitten!), maybe it is a treasure-seeking robot&#8230; specific situations will need some&nbsp;playtesting.</p>
<p>The idea is not just to script the robot to solve one map, though that can be a starting point; a child should be able to script the robot before worrying about more complex situations. The high-level goal is to create a program that lets a robot complete a kind of task on an unknown map. Once you&#8217;ve solved the first level – scripting one map – the adult is encouraged to reconfigure the map to challenge the program (and&nbsp;child).</p>
<p>You could make a computer game to do this. But eh&#8230; though you want to be pedantic as a human computer, you can be somewhat less pedantic than a computer. You can interpret the closest syntactically valid match for what the kid is writing, or correct them. You can narrate what you are doing and why, and you can talk about what is happening when it doesn&#8217;t work. You can probably make bugs fun instead of just frustrating. And then you can tweak the map just enough to stretch the child without completely breaking them. Also kids like to spend time with people more than with&nbsp;computers.</p>
<p>So&#8230; there&#8217;s the concept, I&#8217;ll have to pull together some supplies and give it a&nbsp;go.</p>

I&#8217;m more annoyed than I should be by a Facebook conversation. The premise: who is the Herod of our&nbsp;times?</p>
<p>Who is Herod (http://bible.cc/matthew/2-16.htm)? A two-bit character introduced briefly in Jesus&#8217;s birth story as a villain, and once it became clear that kind of villain wasn&#8217;t part of the story they wanted to tell about Jesus they killed him off, not bothering to fill out the character or even teach a lesson. And we are supposed to take a lesson from&nbsp;this?</p>
<p>Myth is a terrible place from which to learn lessons. Unless perhaps you view them with a more skeptical, more cynical eye (I&#8217;m looking at you Ishmael – http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ishmael_(novel) ) – the lesson of Herod is the lesson of how people create narratives, gravitas, how they try to get you on their side, and perhaps how tired tropes find their way into so many stories. It isn&#8217;t a lesson about what people actually do, or why they do it, or what is right and&nbsp;wrong.</p>
<hr>
<p>Huh, after getting some more hands-on experience with Operational Transformations (ala Etherpad) I&#8217;m a little confused by why the whole diamond-rewriting-composition part is as complicated as it is. The problem is out-of-order transformations being received, and everyone has to come to a consistent document. Transformations are rewritten to handle this conflict gracefully, given potentially quite a lot of these conflicts (like when two people are actively typing in a&nbsp;document).</p>
<p>But couldn&#8217;t we give every version a number, with all versions ordered? We assign the clients an order as well. Versions then are <span class="caps">MAJOR</span>.<span class="caps">MINOR</span>, where the minor version is the client&#8217;s order, and the major version is the increment of the last major version. Any client can then produce a version that fits into a global sequence of&nbsp;versions.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll assume that while timing is unreliable, ultimately all messages get through. So then we have the&nbsp;case:</p>
<ol>
<li>A client produces/shares a change, giving the previous document version and a new document version, and the diff that produces the&nbsp;change.</li>
<li>A client receives a change that works from the version it already has; it can then simply apply the&nbsp;diff.</li>
<li>A client receives a change that works from a previous version of the document (i.e., the client that produced the change hadn&#8217;t received some local change, or two entirely separate clients produced conflicting&nbsp;changes).</li>
</ol>
<p><span class="caps">OK</span>, so 3 is really the tricky part. What then do we do? Let&#8217;s say we have client A and B (ordered alphabetically). We start with document 6.A. Client A applies a change creating 7.A, we&#8217;ll call this change Patch1. It receives a change transforming 6.A into 7.B; we&#8217;ll call that Patch2. The new version will be 7.B (because it is the latest version). It sees that 7.A is therefore an obsolete change, and it creates 8.A that re-applies the change. Client B ultimately receives that patch from 6.A to 7.A and, using the same algorithm, can also produce&nbsp;8.A.</p>
<p>Which I guess is the same as <span class="caps">OT</span>. The transformation of patches is that 6.A+Patch1=7.A, and 6.A+Patch2=7.B. We then define the&nbsp;operations:</p>
<p>6.A+Patch2+transpose(Patch1, Patch2)=8.A, 6.A+Patch1+transpose(Patch2,&nbsp;Path1)=8.A</p>
<p>transpose() is not too terribly hard a function to produce, though it will effect user experience when conflicts arise. It must be deterministic, and must satisfy this basic&nbsp;equivalence.</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t decide if the ordering of clients matters. I think it does? That is, I think without that ordering we may not be able to make those two orders of execution reliable when conflicts arise (i.e., the same edit has to win on both clients). Maybe this isn&#8217;t as hard as I&nbsp;thought?</p>

<p>A long time back I read a post with the simple message: if someone doesn&#8217;t understand me, it&#8217;s my fault not theirs.

<p>Some thoughts on <span class="caps">OT</span> so&nbsp;far:</p>
<ul>
<li>EasySync the protocol feels too connected to text editing with annotations. (From this perspective Mobwrite is then just text editing without annotations.) I don&#8217;t want to squeeze everything into&nbsp;text.</li>
<li>Etherpad Lite has some code in Javascript that appears reusable outside of the entire context of Etherpad. That is&nbsp;appreciated.</li>
<li>ShareJS seems more flexible, and even presents a non-text demo (a game). ShareJS uses <span class="caps">JSON</span> for its protocol, which makes it more naturally&nbsp;extensible.</li>
<li>ShareJS is written in CoffeeScript, with lots of CoffeeScript idioms. It&#8217;s technically Javascript, but I don&#8217;t feel I&#8217;d be able to adopt any of its code literally as a result. (But I&#8217;m not above transcribing code into other&nbsp;languages.)</li>
<li>ShareJS is also younger and more experimental than it might seem from its site (which looks very nice and&nbsp;polished).</li>
<li>Other systems have ideas that might be useful, but I am not sure they have code that could be useful, or even protocols. Maybe&nbsp;Wave.</li>
<li>Wave, from my memory, emphasizes the document model, which is kind of like text with annotations, and kind of like overlaid <span class="caps">XML</span>. I remember it being a bit quirky, though I could also understand the justifications. I suppose understanding the expectations of the document model (i.e., valid <span class="caps">XML</span>) could inform the patching process. But I just don&#8217;t know what to take away from Wave, there&#8217;s a lot going on there (http://www.waveprotocol.org/protocol), more than I know how to digest (especially since I know that I don&#8217;t want to take the whole worldview – I don&#8217;t want to create a&nbsp;worldview!)</li>
<li>Maybe Wave is what happens when you don&#8217;t have a distinct concept of a &#8220;document&#8221; or a &#8220;repository&#8221; (with a repository being kind of like a super-document). That is, in Wave all things don&#8217;t belong to one container, and that makes things more complicated. And when things don&#8217;t belong to just one container you get trees, and then you got <span class="caps">XML</span>.</li>
<li>I really want patches to be an abstract concept, with certain expectations of what you can do with patches (I think inverting and commuting as in Darcs might be the essential operations, along with generating, applying, and verifying those patches.) I think this is the essence of <span class="caps">OT</span>, though the details of these things (especially commuting patches) can be ambiguous. But there is no &#8220;right&#8221; way to resolve conflicts, only less-wrong ways. There&#8217;s more to <span class="caps">OT</span> than the patches, but I think the patches might be the only application-specific&nbsp;aspect?</li>
</ul>

<p>In defense of pundits, sometimes being right is not the most useful thing a speaker can be for their audience. Someone who is wrong, or does not offer any qualifications on their claims, can in a way be inviting the audience to make up their own mind – to react. Anyone can be right by being vague, by allowing for multiple possibilities. The journalist who prefaces everything with &#8220;it is claimed&#8221; or similar conditions is doing this, being right by avoiding being anything. Even Nate Silver in his way did this, with a forecast that predicted probabilities – he&#8217;s still allowed to be &#8220;wrong&#8221; 10% of the time when he claims Obama had a 90% chance of winning, because there&#8217;s no truly wrong answer. There were states where one candidate or the other had a 99% chance of winning: what does that 1% even really mean? The chance that the leading candidate dies shortly before the&nbsp;election?</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not a fan of pundits, but I&#8217;m not a fan of journalistic &#8220;objectivity&#8221; either, and mere predictions don&#8217;t cover&nbsp;much.</p>

<p>A small comparison I had not thought&nbsp;about:</p>
<p><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>If back in the 1950s, 60s, and 70s, Chinese Communism had managed to deliver propserity as effectively as Soviet Communism (i.e., a not-so-high bar) then the reforms of the 1990s and 1980s would have ended up offering a much smaller payoff and the whole arc of Chinese growth post-<span class="caps">WWII</span> would have been smoother and less&nbsp;dramatic.&#8221;</p>
<p>Was the Soviet Union in some sense more successful than China? Or maybe it&#8217;s how you manage the transitions, not the absolute good you deliver, that defines sustainable political power. And in some periods the Soviet Union was really successful at economic growth. That is, the growth in the <span class="caps">USSR</span> before and after <span class="caps">WWII</span> was actually a pretty high bar. It just didn&#8217;t seem translatable to later&nbsp;needs.</p>
<p>And I&#8217;m still a little confused how both nations ended up being so bad at farming for extended periods, seemingly worse than their efforts at industrialization. Command economies are&nbsp;weird.</p>

<p>Not sure what I think about this. I won&#8217;t summarize it because I haven&#8217;t thought enough or listened closely enough to summarize it, so I suppose these thoughts will lack context and be largely useless if you don&#8217;t watch the&nbsp;video.</p>
<p>First major objection: why believe that we live in the present moment? This is put forward as a kind of self-evident truth, but it doesn&#8217;t jive with our self-concept, with any of our actions, with society. This is too much deference to physics (and perhaps too much deference to Buddhism). We don&#8217;t really have a handle on consciousness, and yet we presume to define consciousness and experience in these very reductionist terms. I have not however figured out what to really describe as the alternative (having discarded&nbsp;&#8220;eternity&#8221;).</p>
<p>Second: he offers mindfulness meditation as the beginning of an answer to the challenge of suffering without the comfort of religion. This comes out in particular right at the end (last 10 minutes or so). I think he misses the conflict. We can alleviate suffering in many ways, including purely psychological ways (such as meditation), but the reason everyone doesn&#8217;t take advantage of this isn&#8217;t just because they don&#8217;t know about it, or haven&#8217;t done the work. I see other avoidance techniques as kind of similar – you can take drugs, watch <span class="caps">TV</span>, follow the elections too closely, play video games, all to avoid ideas that make us suffer. Many people of course do this; I do this. But what regulates that avoidance isn&#8217;t that it&#8217;s too hard, it&#8217;s because of a belief: I don&#8217;t want to be that person. If we want, as he says, to have a reason to just be happy in the present moment, there are options to do get present moment happiness. But we don&#8217;t want to simply acquire happiness, we want to find a reason, to feel we&#8217;ve earned that happiness. <em>And what is more</em>, finding happiness is not our greatest goal – that is why we do not allow ourselves to pursue happiness unbounded, that is why we regularly place ourselves in the way of psychological harm, and look up to those that do so. Is meditation – as a path to happiness – any better, or just a narcissism that has created an impressive story about why it is&nbsp;virtuous?</p>

<p>This suggests that many of the deaths in the 16th Century in Mexico may have been from an indigenous disease (not a European disease), compounded by a bad drought – which not only made people vulnerable but also apparently changed the ecology to increase transmission through rodents. This figure is a sort of summary of the apocalyptic population decline: http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/8/4/01-0175-f1.htm – it gives a perspective to the way Mexico is presented in movies as kind of empty-feeling in the 19th century, as it kind of was empty, growing to only a little more than half its pre-Columbian population by the year&nbsp;1900.</p>

<p>I find diseases that have come and gone to be quite curious. The Black Death for instance seems, even if related to the Bubonic Plague, to also be somewhat unique: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Death#Alternative_explanations – I suppose something about it reminds me of the arc of ecological change as it presents itself in individuals&#8217;&nbsp;lives.</p>

<p>I like to imagine what the transitional period was like for homo-whatevers when we went from not having language to having language. I imagine this happening in a previous species. I assume we don&#8217;t know? Did we move quickly from gestures to syntax? Or fluidly, starting with simple syntax, like the stereotypical caveman? Or did we accumulate a large number of noun-like utterances until, overwhelmed, it fell into place in a structure where a smaller vocabulary could support a larger number of ideas? Did we learn then to talk of the past, or the future, and to talk of possibilities&#8230; or were those ideas already around, perhaps expressed with shared pretend play or acting, and we found a voice for something we already&nbsp;had?</p>
<p>In this video Ze suggests laughter (at times) could be an emotional release, perhaps when tension or fear is resolved. A way to tell each other, or even just ourselves: no really, it&#8217;s all okay. Which makes me imagine laughter as a pre-language expression, as something that could lead into&nbsp;language.</p>

<p><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>Google captured purchase intent and sold it to the highest&nbsp;bidder&#8221;</p>

<p>A thought while watching this little video of a robot walking: http://www.theatlantic.com/video/index/261343/ – part way through someone gives the robot a shove, to demonstrate that it&#8217;s able to handle and correct for outside forces. And the robot of course just gets its balance and keeps&nbsp;going.</p>
<p>It made me think of my <span class="caps">GPS</span> navigation in the car. One thing I&#8217;ve become very fond of, is if I miss a turn or just blithely ignore the navigation suggestion, it takes no offense, it just tells me the new route. The voice somehow feels judging, so we have it on mute – we really prefer that it be entirely divorced from the experience of a human navigator, and the result is far less&nbsp;stressful.</p>
<p>As long as you don&#8217;t knock down the robot or otherwise damage it, the robot doesn&#8217;t really care if you inhibit it. If you walk three-breasted on the sidewalk and give it no room to pass, it doesn&#8217;t care. If it&#8217;s standing in the way and you just push it aside, it doesn&#8217;t care. Which is great. And I wonder, similar to putting the navigator on mute, that we&#8217;ll want non-anthropomorphic robots for just this reason: we don&#8217;t have to care about their feelings, it&#8217;s often convenient and less stressful to disregard their &#8220;feelings&#8221; (which are of course entirely in our own imagination!) and so we should avoid triggering our natural impulse to&nbsp;empathize.</p>
<p>Another thought: could something similar happen with self-driving cars? Right now as a pedestrian I theoretically have the right of way at any intersection unless there&#8217;s a green light or arrow . And in most situations I could actually take that right of way if I wished – if I walked into the road, held up my hand, traffic would stop. But I don&#8217;t do that, it feels uncomfortably assertive, I am surprising drivers and I don&#8217;t know how they&#8217;ll react, and even if they stop I don&#8217;t want to get a dirty look. But if a car was driving itself then it&#8217;s only the car that is really going to be confused, and the car doesn&#8217;t really care. This could mean a greatly different dynamic on our public&nbsp;roads.</p>

<p>This article argues primarily that algebra is creating an insurmountable barrier for a class of students, and that it should not be the kind of prerequisite that it is. Secondarily it argues that algebra is not very useful to many people. And in conclusion, we shouldn&#8217;t require&nbsp;it.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m fairly sympathetic to desires to change math requirements, though this argument relies too much on the difficulty of math – an argument which can be easily disputed (e.g.,&nbsp;http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/answer-sheet/post/yes-algebra-is-necessary/2012/07/30/gJQAr6xMKX_blog.html).</p>
<p>I&#8217;m more concerned that algebra is, in current educational paths, a common terminal math class, and it is a terrible terminal math class. It introduces all sorts of formalisms and techniques and language that only really becomes useful later, as part of an entire lineage of mathematics, a lineage most people aren&#8217;t going to participate in, nor should we expect them to. If algebra is your last math class, where in your life would you possibly need to solve a second-order polynomial? Would you learn anything more from learning those equations than you would from memorizing&nbsp;poetry?</p>
<p>I&#8217;m all for algorithmic thinking, and learning how to apply numbers, but algebra is just a really bad way to do that. Not just because it&#8217;s too hard. There are many problems you can&#8217;t solve with high-school algebra, problems that can actually be solved with high-school skills, but because of the emphasis on these specific techniques we don&#8217;t teach other challenging, advanced, and useful&nbsp;techniques.</p>
<p>In the response the author&nbsp;says:</p>
<p><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>The difficulty students have in applying math to everyday problems they encounter is not particular to math. Transfer is hard. New learning tends to cling to the examples used to explain the concept. That’s as true of literary forms, scientific method, and techniques of historical analysis as it is of mathematical&nbsp;formulas.</p>
<p><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>The problem is that if you try to meet this challenge by teaching the specific skills that people need, you had better be confident that you’re going to cover all those skills. Because if you teach students the significance of the Consumer Price Index they are not going to know how to teach themselves the significance of projected inflation rates on their investment in CDs. Their practical knowledge will be specific to what you teach them, and won’t&nbsp;transfer.&#8221;</p>
<p>This is just so wrong. If you teach them what the <span class="caps">CPI</span> is, if you get them to a point where they could create their own inflation index given some data (e.g., let them make their own basket), and so forth, they will be far more ready to transfer that information to other areas than with your formal tools (which they all will have forgotten). I personally feel pretty confident that I can figure out how these things apply, I took a lot of math, and even I can&#8217;t remember those formal tools. The formalisms flow from the integrated understanding, they are not the source of integrated knowledge, and this is where our pedagogues are getting it wrong. Once you reverse this idea of cause-and-effect algebra starts looking far less&nbsp;important.</p>

<p>I got a lot out of this talk. Quite&nbsp;recommended.</p>
<p>One thing they talk about later on is the policy implications of various studies – and in particular, that things don&#8217;t change much. Like if you added up the purported positive effect of all the educational interventions, you&#8217;d expect every child to grow up a genius&#8230; but in reality these interventions don&#8217;t add up, and seldom could achieve their expectations standing alone. Which isn&#8217;t so much an indictment as just the admission: it&#8217;s hard to change&nbsp;anything.</p>
<p>Except then you must ask: why do things change? I feel like this pessimism is unwarranted, or at least it points to the impotence of&nbsp;policy.</p>
<p>Also I feel it&#8217;s the effect of truth-in-the-aggregate. I&#8217;m incredibly tired of statistics, and of data-driven policy. We&#8217;re trying to tease bits of &#8220;truth&#8221; out of noise, while ignoring models and real understanding&#8230; and completely ignoring individuals. In the aggregate policy has no effect because most people don&#8217;t care about your policy, even the people receiving or implementing the policy. But that says nothing of our individual ability to effect change. Yet we are surrounded by &#8220;news&#8221; (not just news, serious news) about how we should parent, or eat, or what education to pursue, or how to find love or happiness, based on these aggregates. And it&#8217;s just so&nbsp;dull&#8230;</p>
<p>Nevertheless, really interesting&nbsp;interview.</p>

<p><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>Relation of Threatened Egotism to Violence and Aggression: The Dark Side of High Self-Esteem&#8221; –&nbsp;http://www.emotionalcompetency.com/papers/baumeistersmartboden1996%5B1%5D.pdf</p>
<p>An interesting paper, making the claim that it is not low self-esteem that leads to violent behavior, but rather a high but fragile self-esteem, or exaggerated self-esteem (which is generally fragile since it is&nbsp;unjustified).</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a lot of citations offered as evidence, though of course citation alone doesn&#8217;t mean the conclusions follow. But the logic of the argument makes sense, and more sense than the frequently applied but not frequently justified assumption that low self-esteem is the basis of violent&nbsp;tendencies.</p>

<p>Every time I hear &#8220;the fact of the matter is&#8221; or &#8220;the reality is&#8221; I know I am about to hear someone pull out some &#8220;common sense&#8221; bullshit. It&#8217;s like a code phrase for &#8220;I have no facts or even an anecdote to offer but I want to add a contrarian&nbsp;opinion.&#8221;</p>
<p>This seems to be specifically a Very Serious People problem.

<p>I was listening to this discussion the other day, about John Rawls (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Rawls) (and later about Robert Nozick – http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Nozick – but I found that part less&nbsp;interesting).</p>
<p>I found the Difference Principle (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justice_as_Fairness#The_Difference_Principle) interesting enough that it&#8217;s stuck with me for the last few days. Wikipedia&#8217;s description feels a little lifeless, but to paraphrase what I remember from Schmidtz&#8217;s&nbsp;description:</p>
<p>The social order that is most just is the one that does the most for the person with the&nbsp;least</p>
<p>This doesn&#8217;t place equality of distribution as the goal, but accepts that quantity is not static and so the most just order may involve inequality. And certainly when you consider things besides resources this seems very proper indeed – when you consider the distribution of compassion, of respect, and of legal justice, equality is certainly less important than&nbsp;quantity.</p>
<p>By judging what the least among us receives, this is distinct from strict Utilitarianism (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utilitarianism) which might suggest that some may suffer if it is offset by even more happiness on the part of others (or in an absurdly degenerate form: http://www.smbc-comics.com/?id=2569). It also avoids the problem of comparing individual experiences. How does the happiness I get from a tasty cookie compare to your happiness finding a parking spot? Your happiness keeping your job? What if a bunch of us get tasty cookies, how many equal your job? The comparisons are somewhat absurd, though they also exist as real moral questions as the effect of an action can manifest itself in radically different ways for different people, and with substantially different numerators and&nbsp;denominators.</p>
<p>Anyway, I found the idea interesting, and while I don&#8217;t necessarily consider social justice the most important lens for many situations I at least appreciate criteria that makes sense, and this makes more sense to me than other (usually very vague) ways that I&#8217;ve thought about&nbsp;it.</p>

<p>The last six weeks have been&#8230; geez. I learned my niece Indigo had an enlarged heart, then cardiomyopathy, then a congenital disorder, and through it declining health, her heart growing weaker and weaker, large enough to crowd out one lung, growing so large because it had work so hard to only beat gently. It&#8217;s felt like a slow and painful and frightening&nbsp;decline.</p>
<p>But today, she has a new heart. And I am feeling very optimistic. Somewhere another family is grieving a terrible loss, and I feel it too, even across the barrier of anonymity. But I&#8217;m very thankful to that family, and to that baby, for giving Indigo a chance, and giving us a chance to know&nbsp;Indigo.</p>
<p>Ada is just three months older than Indigo, and since before they were born I have imagined them growing up together, knowing each other intimately and knowing each other from before they could even remember knowing. And I&#8217;ve enjoyed parenthood so much, and I&#8217;ve watched my sister and my brother-in-law struggle so much and its pained me that they haven&#8217;t been able to partake in those simple pleasures, as Indigo herself has not been able to enjoy the world nearly so much because her heart just couldn&#8217;t do enough; Indigo always seemed uncomfortable, and now we know she probably was uncomfortable, that things weren&#8217;t right for her for a long time. And now I feel a bit sad for her heart, though it feels a tad silly – it tried so hard, and compensated in such an extreme fashion for its own failings, and now&#8230; I don&#8217;t know where it is.&nbsp;Discarded?</p>
<p>But now I&#8217;m mostly hopeful and happy. For a long time things were getting worse, and I believe now that things will start getting better, and when times are hard they aren&#8217;t nearly so hard if you have hope they&#8217;ll get&nbsp;better.</p>

<p>I can&#8217;t admit this on Facebook, but I&#8217;ll just tell you guys: I don&#8217;t really care about shelter&nbsp;animals.</p>
<p>I mean, it&#8217;s fine&#8230; someone should care for unwanted animals and so forth. But among moral issues of our time, it hardly registers to me. And I&#8217;m not just talking global warming, famine, etc. There&#8217;s the big fancy moral issues, but there&#8217;s so many many other moral issues, issues that we as humans should think about. Have you called your grandparents and told them you love them? Shouldn&#8217;t we be hugging each other more often? Some people are dramatically, painfully insane; what can we do for those people? When they are in our lives what do we do for these people? I feel guilty that I&#8217;m not reaching out more to someone I know who I know is depressed, and it&#8217;s hard because he can make me feel depressed, but I should still try. Awkward kids wearing embarrassing clothing: someone need to intervene and get them some respectable clothes. There&#8217;s a thousand of these concrete moral concerns, the concerns of our actual&nbsp;lives.</p>
<p>There are so many of these things and though we talk about few of them they all matter. And shelter animals? I have a hard time constructing a moral world in which they register. Of course, clearly, there is no tradeoff whereby our raising and discarding of pets is morally justified. This is not one of those cold hard calculated compromises. But still&#8230; whatever. To those who care, that&#8217;s fine; but trying to convince everyone else that we should also care is bullshit. It&#8217;s a manipulation of social conventions, because we can&#8217;t say &#8220;this doesn&#8217;t fucking matter&#8221; because it&#8217;s not cool to express that sort of opinion, especially towards the shelter animal people. But fuck, stop trying to guilt trip the rest of us into thinking this is a major social issue. I care mostly for people and I&#8217;m very comfortable with&nbsp;that.</p>
<p><span class="caps">OK</span>&#8230; here&#8217;s where I&#8217;m really going to tell you a secret that I can&#8217;t tell other people, and maybe I&#8217;m even now telling the wrong people, and I preface this by saying that I care for all these people because they are people&#8230; but I can&#8217;t help but wonder about a person&#8217;s engagement with humanity when I see them so concerned with animals. I understand why it is easier to share unconditional love with an animal, to feel more enraged by the treatment of animals, to be more certain about the virtue of animals; I understand it and recognize it as a great moral challenge. The challenge is to see our fellow men and women with the same forgiving and loving perspective that is so easy to apply to dogs and cats. Humans deserve every bit as much unconditional and open loves as pets. Once that happens, how can you not see that the human soul has so many orders of magnitude more depth than these pets? And then&#8230; pets are fine, and they can do good things for us, and a big part of that is what we ourselves do for our pets. But that&#8217;s a personal&nbsp;experience.</p>
<p>Maybe that&#8217;s the challenge I&#8217;m having&#8230; between personal experience and societal obligation. Personal experience is our foundation, its the thing we use to extrapolate onto society. But extrapolation is dangerous, and I see an unfortunate extrapolation here, where a byproduct of personal alienation, a kind of misanthropic preference for pets, is projected onto&nbsp;society.</p>
<p>That all said, I sometimes worry seriously about the moral peril of our relationship and responsibility to simians and cetaceans. So I&nbsp;dunno.</p>

<p>Though there&#8217;s no real point to it, I can&#8217;t help but be amused pondering questions like these:&nbsp;http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/ow4hy/you_are_now_the_monarch_of_a_small_european/</p>
<p><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>You are now the monarch of a small European nation in the middle ages, how do you use your modern knowledge to create the most powerful empire ever&nbsp;seen?</p>
<p><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>Rules: 1. You have 50 years to rule 2. Has to be a small kingdom, like serbia or hungary 3. Placed in 500-1400&nbsp;A.D.&#8221;</p>
<p>I suspect most of the answers get the time scales wrong. Build roads, aquaducts, etc? Even with &#8220;magical&#8221; future knowledge building those investments will take a long time. Everyone can build cesspools and start using basic hygene with instruction, and that&#8217;s cool and all, but it&#8217;s not that revolutionary. A lot could be accomplished with military strategy, but that takes some time too. People mention longbows&#8230; which are cool, but take 10 years or more to master (archeologists have found notable differences in the skeletons of longbowmen; it&#8217;s freakish). I suppose to be fair there may be significant military discipline among the populace already. Still&#8230; while the compound returns on these investments might be substantial, will it matter in the short term? &#8220;Short term&#8221; was a lot longer back then. And technology is hard to&nbsp;bootstrap.</p>

<p>At a recent conference, kind of a brain-stormy conference, there was a small discussion about the possibility of ubiquitous public surveillance. E.g., putting a camera every 100 yards wouldn&#8217;t be that expensive. And what&nbsp;then?</p>
<p>Well, we went back and forth a bunch, and there&#8217;s always the looming civil rights angle. But: what specifically are we afraid of? I asked that question, but I felt like other people weren&#8217;t that interested and it didn&#8217;t go that&nbsp;far.</p>
<p>But damn&#8230; we talk about this stuff always alluding to the dangers, and we spend very little time actually investigating those dangers. The more I think about it, the less I think we are having rational discussions for lack of real&nbsp;evidence.</p>
<p>I tried to write down what I knew about the one case I know about, my sister&#8217;s. It&#8217;s just one case, but it&#8217;s specific. I hear references to other cases, but it&#8217;s not always that clear to me. For instance, the <span class="caps">SHAC7</span> are often referred to: http://www.shac7.com - and there was electronic surveillance in that case, but from everything I can tell it had little to do with the case; it didn&#8217;t identify the accused, and wasn&#8217;t part of the prosecution&#8217;s&nbsp;case.</p>
<p>The non-political cases are considered even less. There are clearly some big dysfunctions in our legal system, but what would the affect of ubiquitous surveillance be in those cases? <span class="caps">DNA</span> evidence, for instance, I believe (entirely by hunch, I have no numbers) has protected more than harmed people in the groups most targeted by the law system (i.e., young black men). There certainly are ways that surveillance could hurt more than help those groups! But we can get specific, instead of just using a knee-jerk assessment that anything The Man does always serves to&nbsp;oppress.</p>
<p>If we identify specific problems, then we can direct our efforts in that direction instead of universal contrarianism. I believe when it comes to privacy the contrarians and cynics have been too dominate in the&nbsp;discussion.</p>

<p>This makes me want to write up a prediction of the next, um, 20-30 years? from a social/political perspective: http://www.openthefuture.com/2012/01/the_future_isnt_what_it_used_t.html - not because I&#8217;m going to get it right, but as an intellectual exercise. I have some intuitions, but my own thinking is still dominated too much by agreeing or reacting against a small set of actual thinkers on these matters (and a lot of baseless &#8220;common sense&#8221; assumptions about the future, e.g., &#8220;the <span class="caps">U.S.</span> is becoming a police state!&#8221;&nbsp;thinking).</p>
<p>Maybe one of the biases that has made thinking along these lines is the attention paid to newsworthy events. If you do a random sampling of your own or other people&#8217;s lives, even very politically active people, it&#8217;s hard to see real movement towards a police state (or towards socialism or whatever chip you have on your shoulder). But if you use particular news sources it is easy to see these things. Looking at news sources is a great way to establish an intuition for how news sources will change in the future, I don&#8217;t think it says much about how life will&nbsp;change.</p>

<p>The dispassionate reporter of discovered knowledge is different from the neutral reporter of opinion (I&#8217;m so bored of that approach to news), or the pundrity that lacks insight but knows like a fraudulent mind-reader how to say nothing while seeming to make real claims. And this is not the same as the &#8220;realist&#8221; which is usually just cynicism in pretending to be empiricism. The source of Having Something To Say is still study, knowledge, intelligence, insight; to be a dispassionate reporter is to respect your audience to interpret those insights on their own, or to interact honestly in the pursuit of truth instead of a desire to&nbsp;win.</p>

<p>tl;dr, successful and well-educated guy takes 10th grade standardized test and fails badly. He doesn&#8217;t see the relevance of the test material to his professional or personal life, or anyone he&nbsp;knows.</p>
<p>There are test techniques that I believe can be much more informative than multiple-choice standardized testing. Some are intense, like an evaluation by interview (something akin to what Piaget did with young children: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_Piaget#The_Development_of_new_methods). But though I suppose we can&#8217;t use intense methods on every child, it certainly is a tool for controlling the test. Instead tests are controlled off a feedback system, future performance, correlation with other similarly-structured tests, or I&#8217;m sure in many cases nothing at&nbsp;all.</p>
<p>We should be testing the testers, and that means a careful examination of a sampling of children who fail and who pass, using radically different evaluation&nbsp;techniques.</p>
<p>I think it is possible that we could actually do wide-spread accurate testing. Or not&#8230; but we definitely aren&#8217;t right&nbsp;now.</p>

<p>Standardized testing unfortunately makes it impossible for a single teacher to make this reform&#8230;except in institutions not driven by testing, like a gifted program where you can expect the kids to do fine, or private school. I think it&#8217;s notable that <span class="caps">AP</span> classes don&#8217;t allow this freedom, and unfortunately have been replacing other advanced&nbsp;programs.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also unclear what an enlightened parent can do. Grade level advancement doesn&#8217;t change the nature of the education, just the topic. Supplementary education is possible, but there&#8217;s a certain cynicism to it, leaving the student oppressed in these pointless classes. Can you send your kid to a public middleschool for just a half day? I&#8217;ve known some homeschoolers that let their kids kind of flirt with public school without expecting much academic learning. How easy is it to negotiate that, I wonder? And again all these things are hard to do except with a student that is already advanced, or perhaps a failing student that demands a creative approach, while a student that is just getting by with the standard curriculum is kind of lost, performing adequately with effort but learning&nbsp;little.</p>

<p>What might only be really called an aside by Matthew Yglesias;&nbsp;http://thinkprogress.org/yglesias/2011/11/07/362297/you-dont-know-what-im-all-about/</p>
<p><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>I think the punk scene and the humanistic branches of the academy have some important things in common. They both involve a kind of deep rejection of the logic of market&nbsp;exchange.&#8221;</p>
<p>I hadn&#8217;t really thought about it, but I can see how there is an anti-market aspect to academia. That&#8217;s interesting, but what really tickles the imagination is the idea of punk being a rejection of the market. Is <span class="caps">DIY</span> also a rejection of markets? It&#8217;s so easy to see where markets are, where they excel&#8230; and if you look a bit harder, you can see where they fail. It&#8217;s common when you see markets fail to also look at how to fix the system, how to fix the market, make it more open or more fair or more transparent. But I haven&#8217;t thought in any systematic way about where markets don&#8217;t&nbsp;belong.</p>
<p>This makes punk feel much more relevant to&nbsp;me.</p>

<p>An interesting discussion of police response to drug&nbsp;violence.</p>
<p>In it he talks about one time when they identified a group of drug dealers, and constructed cases on them; not necessarily the best cases, but good enough. Then they approached both the dealers and people who cared about those young men - mostly mothers and grandmothers - and told them that they would not prosecute if they stopped their actions, but if they saw any sign of further dealing they would bring up those old/shelved cases. And it was&nbsp;effective.</p>
<p>This reminds me of the incident in my neighborhood, that I wrote about a couple times (first https://plus.google.com/104537541227697934010/posts/W6bR8VQHCp1 then https://plus.google.com/104537541227697934010/posts/fPoaStXxx1W). The man who was stabbed and killed (in a case of self defense) is profiled a bit in our neighborhood newspaper:&nbsp;http://www.southsidepride.com/2011/09/articles/The_lonesome_death_Justin_Jackson.html</p>
<p>What&#8217;s notable from the profile is that he committed a lot of crimes in the months before his death. I don&#8217;t really understand why he wasn&#8217;t in jail (where, it turns out, he would have been safer, i.e., kept safe from&nbsp;himself).</p>
<p>But there&#8217;s a kind of get-tough-on-crime potential here, but not tough as in jail. This guy got arrested a bunch of times, and it seemed to have no positive impact on him or society. But each of these arrests was a time when the state/society can have a lot of impact. Did his family, or any responsible person in his life, know what he was&nbsp;doing?</p>
<p>We can put people&#8217;s faces on billboards (as some places, for example when a person is arrested for soliciting a prostitute). But that&#8217;s really passive-aggressive. But family should know; and if the arrest was bullshit then fine, there&#8217;s a chance to explain (unlike with a billboard). If someone is going to reform this person, it&#8217;s not going to be the police. And if the individual feels no shame in coming before the system, they might still feel the sting of shame when their actions are presented to their loved ones. (If the person has no responsible people that can be identified in their lives? Then things are pretty fucked up, time to try something&nbsp;else.)</p>

<p>So you&#8217;ve probably heard we&#8217;ve reached 7 billion people on this&nbsp;planet.</p>
<p>I was talking with a friend about the Green Revolution (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Revolution) some time back&#8230; and about genetically modified food, chemical fertalizers, etc. They viewed that all with skepticism to say the least. But, I asked, what about all the people that otherwise would have died? Our planet&#8217;s population did not explode because people started having more children, it exploded because those children stopped dying. This crisis of population is a crisis of people not dying, and that does not as such seem like such a terrible&nbsp;crisis.</p>
<p>Before I became a parent I have noted that I expect my children to make the world a better place. Not hope but expect. This is not a very high bar: I expect that the world will be better with my child in it than it would be without my child in it. People have looked at me funny when I&#8217;ve said this, like this is some overbearing expectation, but now that I have a daughter I still feel the same, and I would hope that every parent would have this&nbsp;expectation.</p>
<p>And if such an expectation is achieved, multiplied by seven billion&#8230; would that not be wonderful? And why shouldn&#8217;t it be, it is within everyone&#8217;s ability to give at least a little more than is received, no matter how little that person may&nbsp;receive.</p>
<p>I have known people who have said: this world has too many people, I do not feel it is responsible to bring another person into it. I find this peculiar when I consider this simple expectation. But certainly not every parent expects this and not every child achieves it. Which is why, though I am not particularly afraid of 7 billion people, I do very much wish every child to be a choice; not necessarily a plan, but a choice, because I think then this ambition can be met, that each child will be met by their parents eagerly and with&nbsp;optimism.</p>
<p>Seven billion people is still a lot of people. But we have seven billion people to figure out how to make this work. We have interestng challenges&nbsp;ahead.</p>

<p>I came upon in this anti-malaria-fighting article (book review?) in a comment in response to the recent news about a malaria vaccine (http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/10/18/us-malaria-vaccine-scientist-idUSTRE79H59220111018 - I&#8217;d note that this vaccine, though a step forward, has fairly limited&nbsp;protection).</p>
<p>Besides disagreeing with the generally pessimistic tone, I find the underlying assumptions of this line of argument to be morally corrupted. But I should not spend the time to describe why right&nbsp;now.</p>
<p>(re:&nbsp;https://www.guernicamag.com/pogue_1_15_11/)</p>
<p>https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3132273</p>
<p>I think there&#8217;s something very patronizing and morally inconsistent about the kind of argument that is described in that article. Underlying its argument is a belief that the lives of all the people who die aren&#8217;t important, that these deaths are somehow the proper and natural balance. In some ways it may echo the cultures themselves; when life is precarious and lost for no outward reason (such as by a disease like malaria) then individual life loses some of its meaning, people value not only each other but even themselves&nbsp;less.</p>
<p>Medically there&#8217;s a tone of what-doesn&#8217;t-kill-you-makes-you-stronger, which is kind of bullshit. Malaria might not kill native adults very often, but it is not&nbsp;harmless.</p>
<p>And economically, the argument is similarly patronizing. After going on about the native immunity many people have, it then talks about how economic disruption is causing migrations, leading to people (not just whites) who don&#8217;t have the immunity to be exposed. The response: people should stay in their place. That the prerequisite for solving any problem is to revert to traditional structures and strengthen those structures (the same basic argument is made about poverty and many other African problems). The idea that Africans may in fact wish to have control of their own personal destiny is disregarded &#8212; that if conditions were better, if economic forces were less manipulative, people might still want to migrate, because the drive to better one&#8217;s life persists even when life is&nbsp;okay.</p>

<p>In an institution/company, what might we do when there is very inappropriate behavior? (re:&nbsp;https://plus.google.com/104537541227697934010/posts/TTSNAB7aQGh)</p>
<p>I am a fan of Restorative Justice (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restorative_justice). I only know of it one degree removed, I haven&#8217;t been involved in it directly. So, take this for what it is, given an indirect opinion of the&nbsp;matter.</p>
<p>Restorative Justice is an effort to create a new approach to crimes that have victims. The standard approach is to punish: you hurt the perpetrator, and in doing so you presumably pacify the victim. In a restorative justice program the victim has the opportunity to confront the perpetrator, to express how they were hurt, to know that it was heard by the perpetrator, and to have the perpetrator assertively understand the affect of what they&#8217;ve done, and directly try to make amends for their actions. The goal is one where the victim is satisfied and the perpetrator is reformed. Those two goals are approached simultaneously and&nbsp;directly.</p>
<p>So what should happen when someone, in the context of an institution (company, school, etc), acts in a grossly inappropriate manner? Let&#8217;s say: if the person is just an asshole, if they&#8217;ve mistakenly revealed their inner beliefs, if they are just opposed to the mission of the institution, then they should be fired. It&#8217;s a big world, you shouldn&#8217;t hook up with the wrong&nbsp;person/institution.</p>
<p>But what if this seems unusual, out of the place? Something I&#8217;ve learned about interaction with strangers in the public realm is: you never know what someone is going through. Bad shit is happening to some people, and they might seem terrible as a result. It&#8217;s not what any of us would want&#8230; but the right approach is to pull them closer, not to push them away. It&#8217;s too hard to figure out in the public sphere, but in an institution we have the tools to do the right thing. And even if it isn&#8217;t due to other circumstances, is this just a fucked up misunderstanding due to unfortunate circumstances, or a real&nbsp;problem?</p>
<p>So, bringing this back to the general case: what do you do when someone acts badly in a company or an&nbsp;institution?</p>
<p>I was talking (by necessity in the vaguest terms) with someone else from Mozilla about a vague incident that had occurred. This guy was from France. In France they have lots of labor laws, and he was shocked that someone just go fired out of the blue for a single incident. In France they have a process, a kind of jury of your peers, and they must decide if this is truly a sufficient reason to fire&nbsp;someone.</p>
<p>I have a certain respect for France. If things are going well enough, isn&#8217;t a 35 hour work week a good idea? They have enviable priorities. But frankly I thought this was a fucked up approach. Shit happens, shit which I am not okay with, and the response is a sort of trial? Imagine for instance approaching a female coworker in an inappropriately sexual way, mingling perhaps institutional status and your desire to have sex. That&#8217;s fucked up, and it&#8217;s fucked up for both of you which is why sexual harassment is so damned&nbsp;difficult.</p>
<p>So: imagine this has happened. In the court-like (French) context the perpetrator is highly incentivized to downplay the entire thing. He might even, having sobered up, feel terrible about what he&#8217;s done: but if he wants to keep his job, he better stick to the story that it was no big deal. However he feels, he better not take responsibility for what he did, because taking responsibility means being fired. The French approach encourages everything we don&#8217;t&nbsp;want.</p>
<p>I think the major intellectual problem with the French approach is that it disregards the case of one employee victimizing another employee. It frames everything in a hierarchical relationship, management-vs-employee, and doesn&#8217;t acknowledge that a substantial number of terminations relate to inter-employee issues (some portion of which involve &#8220;victims&#8221;, but probably even then a&nbsp;minority).</p>
<p>The zero-tolerance approach (<span class="caps">AFAIK</span> what Mozilla does) cares little for whether the perpetrator takes responsibility. In the case of employment, the reaction is to render responsibility irrelevant. Once you&#8217;ve been fired it hardly even matters; you are discouraged from even contacting the victim. It would matter if the institution was willing to publicize the reason for termination, but executive bravery meets a very hard limit somewhere before public disclosure. And it&#8217;s not unreasonable: it&#8217;s not okay to publicly condemn someone without also offering a path to redemption, and we have no path to&nbsp;redemption.</p>
<p>This is where I think Restorative Justice has a place. There needs to be a path to redemption, before termination, but also after termination. This doesn&#8217;t just serve to reform the perpetrator, but also serves as an example for the institution. If we aren&#8217;t willing to publicly say what &#8220;acting badly&#8221; means, how can we teach? And the humility of taking responsibility for our bad actions against our fellow employees is perhaps the ultimate culmination of institutional empathy. The worst of these activities (discriminatory, sexist, threatening) is perhaps the best counterexample, but in all its minor forms our wrongs against each other are best resolved in the&nbsp;open.</p>
<hr>
<p>So I was watching the <span class="caps">GOP</span> debates&nbsp;yesterday.</p>
<p>Why, one may ask, would I subject myself to&nbsp;that?</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t really watch sports, but this is largely a matter of cultural background. My parents didn&#8217;t watch sports, they kind of looked down on it, and for better or worse mainstream sports became at best a kind of anthropological exercise. But lacking anything to rebel against, I am really pretty neutral about spectator sports. Most of my peer group shares my disinterest, so there&#8217;s really nothing to rebel against (except &#8220;society&#8221;, but I&#8217;m not into rebelling against&nbsp;that).</p>
<p>Anyway, while considering spectator sports I can see the appeal to the rhythm of it. It&#8217;s not so unlike a video game. The rules of the game provide a very fixed set of variables in the progression of the game; this is appealing because it both gives you something to pay attention to, and gives you the mental relaxation of knowing you can ignore a wide spectrum of things. You can watch the coach get excited with amusement, because you know no one wins or loses until the timeout is over and the players are back in play. And you can watch the almost ritualistic preparation of batter and pitcher, comfortable knowing that the game really continues only when the ball is pitched. Like good humor, there&#8217;s always the chance the parameters might change, someone might steal a base, but allowing the mind to be comfortably relaxed makes that exceptional case all the more enjoyable. (I realize now that I am also describing a&nbsp;sitcom.)</p>
<p>Anyway, I follow presidential electoral politics in much the same way. It&#8217;s bullshit. I have no useful input to it. The ritual of it detracts from any genuine meaning, but at the same time it adds to the entertainment. Presidential electoral politics is kind of unique in this way. You can follow the aggregate partisan campaigns and wins and loses in the same way, but no one race is a sport in quite the way the presidential race&nbsp;is.</p>
<p>So it is with this humility and sense of non-importance that I comment on the presidential campaigns. It&#8217;s fucking bullshit. But some part of me can&#8217;t help but be entertained by it. And like a sports fan that feels invested in some team, also feels invested in wins and losses, I in this same way feel integrated into the race. It&#8217;s bullshit, and I carefully remind myself of this often, but I can&#8217;t help it, I still enjoy this stupid&nbsp;shit.</p>

<p>+Lee Love reminded of me drinking and work (me having been the one who brought it up https://plus.google.com/u/0/104537541227697934010/posts/3Afe8rfnMox), and that reminded me of a seemingly unrelated&nbsp;rant.</p>
<p>I am a fan of drinking in work contexts. I try to act a little inappropriately when that happens. I &#8220;try&#8221; in that I try to err on the side of inappropriate instead of erring on the side of the appropriate. This is an attempt to average; I know that I err on the side of the appropriate when I am sober. Since work drunkenness is uncommon compared to work soberness, it requires some effort to make the averages work out; luckily averages are not handled by a&nbsp;mean.</p>
<p>But&#8230; there&#8217;s a danger to this, because when you try to be inappropriate, and your judgement is already impaired, you might just go too far. And by &#8220;too far&#8221; in this post I mean &#8220;a firing offense&#8221;. (You might also go &#8220;too far&#8221; as in &#8220;being an asshole&#8221;, which frankly haunts me&#8230; but let&#8217;s partition). I&#8217;m going to talk about Mozilla, because that&#8217;s where I work, but I think Mozilla is middle-of-the-road in these issues, so what I say is probably (<span class="caps">AFAIK</span>)&nbsp;general.</p>
<p>In the last Mozilla All Hands (the meeting when all employees come together), in an executive Q&amp;A, +gary kovacs (our <span class="caps">CEO</span>) hinted at people being fired for inappropriate behavior. I.e., being sexist, racist, harassing people, etc. He got a bit of applause for this, though I&#8217;m pretty sure most/all people had no idea what particular incidences he was referring&nbsp;to.</p>
<p>I then learned that later that night someone I knew was fired after having too many drinks (<em>too many</em> being a kind of tautology) and acting violently towards someone else. To this date many people don&#8217;t know this person was even fired, and even less people know why exactly he was fired. (I only know by very indirect&nbsp;rumor.)</p>
<p>What the fuck is accomplished by this sort of thing? It&#8217;s not ballsy (i.e., worthy of applause( to fire someone, but be unwilling to say that you fired them, or why. But it&#8217;s the norm. It&#8217;s an attempt to filter the institution, to make a better company/group by ripping out the bad elements. I try quite hard (and not out of fear or firing) to avoid being a bad element even when drunk, but I acknowledge that potential, even in myself. And yeah, being fired isn&#8217;t the end of the world, especially for&nbsp;us.</p>
<p>Still&#8230; what value there is in drinking with my coworkers is the removal of that filter, and to filter that out of the company feels contrary to that goal. You might (reasonably) remove alcohol from company events, but it&#8217;s just avoiding the issue; if you really think that what is revealed when our guards are down is indicative of true intentions, then giving us alcohol and then firing some of us would be&nbsp;good!</p>
<p>The status quo is one where no one can learn, where institutions can&#8217;t learn. We can&#8217;t create a perfect sieve where the result is the perfect group of people. We have to learn each other, learn ourselves, learn our collective goal. Firing people quietly and without comment doesn&#8217;t accomplish&nbsp;that.</p>
<p>What else might we do? Another&nbsp;post&#8230;</p>
<hr>
<p>I have been considering a question put forward (apologies that I am responding to an aside): &#8220;I’m not ruling out a connection between inequality and the mess we’re in, but for now I don’t see a clear mechanism, and I often annoy liberal audiences by saying that it’s probably possible to have a full-employment economy largely producing luxury goods for the richest 1&nbsp;percent.&#8221;</p>
<p>There is an argument against stimulus funding that the government is inefficient at using the money it has, and that private individuals are more efficient, and so tax cuts have a greater benefit. The underlying idea I think is: the economy does best when money is being used as productively as possible (and insofar as money represents effort, the economy does best when we use our resources as productively as possible). And I believe we all, Keynesian or not, believe that this efficiency&nbsp;matters.</p>
<p>Can we then look at individual spending in the same way we look at government spending? Individual spending can be efficient: a person can for instance buy a reliable car to replace an unreliable car, letting them reliably get to their appointments. Lots of personal spending doesn&#8217;t just give someone else a job, but it makes us individual more productive, or healthier, or reduces possible future liabilities (e.g., home&nbsp;maintenance).</p>
<p>Is there a relation between productive spending and income level? There&#8217;s evidence that the poor don&#8217;t or can&#8217;t use their money as productively (for instance dollar store items are generally cheaper but of lower value than more expensive items). But any middle class consumer realizes also that there is diminishing returns on value as you buy more expensive things. The wealthy might buy a $10k oven, but it is not 10x more valuable than my $1k&nbsp;oven.</p>
<p>It seems possible that this could explain a relation between inequality and our economic problems: we&#8217;re throwing money away on the rich, who aren&#8217;t using their money&nbsp;efficiently.</p>

<p>These days there&#8217;s a lot of hand-wringing about native apps vs. the web. It&#8217;s been going on for a couple years really, though it flares up from time to time. And while there are skirmish wars happening at the boundaries, it&#8217;s a little hard to imagine a native app world. I remember reading through shareware catalogs as a kid, and that&#8217;s where we&#8217;re back to&#8230; and those days were shitty then and honestly pretty shitty now. But allow me to&nbsp;digress&#8230;</p>
<p>I happened upon Know Your Meme, one of those sites that&#8217;s on the periphery of my vision but always strikes me as a weird kind of archeology. I already know more of the memes than I probably should, but there&#8217;s still more of course. In a world of native apps would any of that&nbsp;exist?</p>
<p>Memes are one example of how are experiences on the web are a tip-of-the-iceberg experience. They can&#8217;t exist in an isolated environment. 4chan&#8217;s /b/ is often listed as the originator of these memes, but I suspect they are more often just the broker; and because everything is scrubbed with anonymity as it goes through 4chan it seems as though they themselves are the source. But to actually have a rich world of memes it requires this tremendous depth of interaction which no one person will see. The same goes for most of our content, flowing between information sources, aggregators, discussion. What we each receive has more depth than we would see if we tracked each item back to its source. Then you iterate this process back onto itself and you get the&nbsp;web.</p>
<p>Native apps appear to be able to mimic the experience of the web, but the result is superficial. There is no hidden depth. The best memes that come from Facebook are terrible copy-and-paste status updates, and Facebook is many orders of magnitude deeper than nearly any other native app could ever hope to be. It&#8217;s easy to talk about some stupid &#8220;average user&#8221; who just wants a simple pretty interface or whatever nonsense, but that a poor model. Yes, most people do not realize the depths of the web that make up the foundation of what they surface but that doesn&#8217;t mean they don&#8217;t genuinely appreciate the&nbsp;result.</p>
<hr>
<p>One of the problems he describes is the ol&#8217; this-<span class="caps">URL</span>-belongs-to-someone-else problem (like my profile <span class="caps">URL</span> here,&nbsp;https://plus.google.com/104537541227697934010/posts).</p>
<p>Instead of getting sad, is there a forward-looking resolution to this problem? There are some other issues brought up, but let&#8217;s just talk about portability and persistence of online&nbsp;identity.</p>
<p>There is something elitist about own-your-own-domain-name; it&#8217;s a nice resolution for those of us who can, but it wasn&#8217;t and still isn&#8217;t workable for the now-very-large audience that needs serving. Ultimately the <span class="caps">DNS</span> solution isn&#8217;t entirely different from private services, but it has a more neutral governance structure, and an open set of rules with proper legal redress, etc. It&#8217;s hard to create institutions to govern systems like that; it was and still is hard even to maintain that kind of neutrality for top-level domain names (and second-level are just a return to privately-controlled systems). It&#8217;s also hard to interact with bureaucratic systems like that, and you can&#8217;t maintain well-governed systems without the resources to resolve issues, and so they can&#8217;t really be&nbsp;free.</p>
<p>Resolutions to this identity issue often try to create yet-another-private-service. These services are just as prone to failure and thus to disappearing as any other service; maybe more so because they willingly choose to eschew associated commercial interests that could help fund them. Even then they are seen as competitors for other systems, and as such they get very little help from their&nbsp;competition.</p>
<p>In reality my main identities (@ianbicking on Twitter, /ianbicking on Facebook, /gobbledygook on G+) are actually pretty stable. More stable than anything I can produce. I won&#8217;t forget to pay for my domain name on these services and have some squatter snatch it up. There are ToS issues, but most &#8220;real&#8221; identities will never encounter these problems, and a valid system doesn&#8217;t have to be inclusive of scammers and spammers. The vast majority of people will not encounter issues (and at least G+ forced the issue early, so no one lost an established&nbsp;identity).</p>
<p>I can imagine a decentralized aggregation of these identities, instead of trying to point everything back to some New Hub. It needs to be reliable against a bunch of simple issues: services going down, forgotten passwords or email addresses that stop working, sites that you don&#8217;t even remember you ever used, the occasional bad actor and the frequent spam&nbsp;impersonator.</p>

<p>Re: Diaspora, and the large pile of failed distributed social networks&nbsp;http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2976330</p>
<p>I feel like it&#8217;s a form of opportunity cost that creates an overwhelming debt. Decentralization, and even more so all the motivations that lead developers down the path of decentralization, has nothing to do with making a good social network. It&#8217;s like all the solar-powered cars&#8230; a cute idea, but no one ever (ever) buys a car for fuel efficiency. You buy a car to travel, to carry things. So the solar cars are cute, but they fail at everything a car is supposed to do. You can&#8217;t possibly improve on something unless you start by implementing the&nbsp;thing.</p>

<p>The problems with violence in the neighborhood have continued. In the midst of vigils there have been gunshots, though as far as I know no one hurt. I don&#8217;t really understand what&#8217;s going on. Who are these people? Why are they here? Who is bringing&nbsp;them?</p>
<p>I am not optimistic about a frank and thoughtful discussion about the source of these problems. It&#8217;s not that people don&#8217;t want that discussion, but there is a barrier. A vagueness we all feel compelled to maintain. This isn&#8217;t a general problem with the neighborhood; not at all. This is a problem with a very specific group of people in the neighborhood. That group is a minority of a minority, and there lies the&nbsp;barrier.</p>
<p>The problem isn&#8217;t black people. The black people in this neighborhood are rather the first line of victims. But the problem is a thug culture that is embedded in the black population. I don&#8217;t mention the race because it&#8217;s particularly key to the issue, though any in-depth analysis would have to carefully cultivate a blindness to ignore it. But I mention it because the racial-specificity has made us unable to discuss the specific problem. We talk about &#8220;youth,&#8221; a term that&#8217;s become its own codeword, and &#8220;violence&#8221; as though it&#8217;s some kind of cloud hanging over us, unattached to any individual. But that&#8217;s bullshit. This isn&#8217;t some vague systemic problem. This is a very very specific problem. There is a very specific group of people causing this problem. And for every dramatic incident in the news, there are many more minor incidences; people being attacked (primarily youth-as-in-actually-any-young-person), I&#8217;m sure many a rape among peers, fights, fathers who shirk their responsibilities&#8230; things that are terribly corrosive to the group in which these thugs are&nbsp;embedded.</p>
<p>The barrier to discussion, the vagueness we apply, can feed a kind of racism itself. To identify the problem we must penetrate &#8220;black&#8221; as a monolithic group, in order to talk honestly about the real problem. It&#8217;s all too easy to start applying wide generalizations, like &#8220;black-on-black violence&#8221;. Yes, inter-gang, inter-thug violence is different than other violence. And when those thugs are predominantly black, it is no surprise that thug-on-black violence is fairly common, it&#8217;s a simple matter of proximity. There is something sad and pathetic but unsurprising when the thugs hurt each other, they are victims of their own choices. But everyone else&#8230; when we are unwilling to penetrate the broadest racial group to talk about specific problems all those people are shifted from fellow-victim to incidences of collateral damage. We are unable to talk about the majority-of-the-black-minority that are the people most hurt by the minority-of-a-minority that are&nbsp;thugs.</p>
<p>I risk falling into the pit of Godwin&#8217;s law with great immediacy&#8230; but I have read that among Germans everyone&#8217;s grandma or grandpa was a Nazi resistor, even when all you have to do is talk frankly to many of these people claimed to be wonderful by their grandchildren to realize they are still anti-semitic. Every gang member is a victim. They are all good boys who made the wrong choices, got with the wrong people. The finger always points someplace else. And figuring out who exactly the finger should point to isn&#8217;t particularly productive. But the story we create from these self-serving stories isn&#8217;t an accurate one; we don&#8217;t need to point the finger, but we can&#8217;t believe the grieving mother, the grieving brother, the grieving murderers who talk about their lost&nbsp;friend.</p>
<p>The story we have is one where people get lost. But I don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s right. Thug culture does have something to offer. Something base, appealing, terrible. People choose it, it doesn&#8217;t just choose them. It thrives on the romanticizing of violence, of the idea that it represents something more &#8220;real,&#8221; it wants to dominate the culture it is embedded within. And so much of the rhetoric in opposition to that culture accepts the very lies it&nbsp;spreads.</p>
<p>But I don&#8217;t know what I can do. I am many many generations separated from those lies. The extraction of those lies has in fact been cultivated for generations in my family. It is in part a byproduct of privilege, but to claim that is all it is would be unrespectful of the real effort that went into that. I cannot help but say: please, come with me. But who is ready to do this? And to do it, who must they leave&nbsp;behind?</p>

<p>He begins talking about something very like &#8220;belief templates&#8221; (https://plus.google.com/104537541227697934010/posts/DmJsh6rBtTq), concludes with what he believes is an important challenge for future research, communication of software, based on a foundation not of understanding but negotiation. Though it&#8217;s unclear if the beginning and end of the speech are related, I am tempted to relate them in some fashion&#8230; I&#8217;m just trying to figure out&nbsp;how.</p>
<p>Or, maybe that&#8217;s the problem; focused on belief and understanding we are missing an important cognitive step, a cognitive step that computers-as-agents must take before we get distracted with understanding, empathy, and so&nbsp;on.</p>
<p>I have felt that Object Oriented programming often falls into a morass when people relate the computer objects to real objects, when they focus on modeling a domain. The best Objects are often unrelated to the domain, they are not nouns in any relatable sense. They should flow from the purpose of the task, they should satisfy functional goals, not intellectual concepts. This is part of the process of figuring out what you are making; functional goals are typically far more accurate than intellectual conceptions of a task, and can iteratively guide you through the implementation process. I am tempted then to say that when dealing with cross-system communication we should cast aside meaning and focus only on goals; a system of verbs, commands, questions. Combined with reflection, verification, and a core set of verbs (verification without undo would be rather pointless, for instance), we might then have&nbsp;&#8220;negotiation&#8221;.</p>

<p>There was an incident in my neighborhood a couple days ago. A man was stabbed to death, on the street in front of many witnesses. A few days later we have learned that the man was killed in self-defense (corroborated by security cameras), that a group of other men attacked a guy at a bus stop, and after that man fled they followed him a short distance, and the man then defended himself, wounding one attacker, killing another. Something somewhat similar happened a few years back when a man was robbed on the bike path near my house, and in the scuffle wounded an attacker (again with a knife), a teenage boy, who even after his wound pursued the victim, perhaps in doing so fully sealing his&nbsp;fate.</p>
<p>This neighborhood has a quite active neighborhood forum. I&#8217;m not sure how exactly to describe this neighborhood&#8230; I guess I&#8217;d say it&#8217;s very leftist. &#8220;Liberal&#8221; doesn&#8217;t really fit. As such the reactions are complicated. And of course they should be complicated. To treat death as anything but a tragedy is cruel. But what&nbsp;then?</p>
<p>Some will call the dead man a victim. A victim of&#8230; society, gangs, bad choices. In a sense this is true. But it lacks the appropriate poetry, the appropriate depth. I feel like there is Shakespearean language waiting to be conjured, but I am not well versed enough to find those words. He is a victim of&nbsp;himself.</p>
<p>I have heard many people talk about the poor choices that lead up to these events. I am disappointed by such language. &#8220;Poor choices&#8221; is not the same as &#8220;a corrupted soul,&#8221; and there is a corruption to those who would so freely turn to violence. I doubt any of you reading this make an active choice to commit violence upon another person, or not to do so. If it is a choice it is too&nbsp;late.</p>
<p>But a declaration of justice done seems so cruel. Those of us who put aside violence, deliberately or by circumstance, have also put aside violent justice. To call this just is to accept physical domination, to accept domination and oppression. It is an unfortunate bit of leftist dogma that we forgive the underclass of its own attempts at domination; so often it is the pathetic attempt of the underclass to dominate the underclass. Pathetic in its impotence, but cruel in what it attempts. And this violence is an attempt to&nbsp;dominate.</p>
<p>This man who is dead has been undone. Unrepenting, unforgiven, and now with no ability to ever redeem himself. This is the tragedy, and the tragedy of it is&nbsp;deep.</p>

<p>I have a perhaps irrational faith that discussion can help us get beyond irrational belief; that where media has failed we can, through an iterative process, perhaps reach some consensus. Maybe it&#8217;s Wikipedia that makes me feel this way; it is and should be hard, but consensus is possible, especially when built on other&nbsp;relationships.</p>
<p>But of course it&#8217;s not that easy. +Tim Bray has been thinking about this some too (https://plus.google.com/107606703558161507946/posts/B63fDJ9EYno), and probably other people as we now have yet-another-forum-for-discussion, and both successes and failures. A recent post of mine (https://plus.google.com/104537541227697934010/posts/5rX8oMt7hnN) reminded me of the&nbsp;failures.</p>
<p>I think one of the problems we have with discussion forums is that we&#8217;re not confident enough to make rules (beyond barring the most egregious forms of lying and insult; and even that is inconsistent). But everyone understands the flaws of our political discussions, and I think there&#8217;s a lot of room for building up rules that help make the discussions&nbsp;productive.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know what the right rules would be, but it&#8217;s worth discussing. Probably in wiki-form. One (that I thought of from a comment from +Glyph Lefkowitz in a different context) is simply barring generalizations. Or, more specifically in this context: each thread of discussion typically has a leading comment (obviously the personal post in the G+ case). Nothing should be more general than that. You can re-share and generalize, but then you&#8217;ve created another thread; people can choose to participate if they want. But if you want to comment, you should be drilling down on the idea. If it&#8217;s not worth drilling down, then find something that is worth that effort; there is no lack of political material on the&nbsp;internet.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s just one idea. Probably something with Godwin&#8217;s Law is worth including ;) And maybe other things. The goal is productive discussion, not any particular sense of right. Misguided ideas of &#8220;free speech&#8221; and whatnot are much of what makes comment threads such a ghetto; keeping an eye on the goal should&nbsp;help.</p>

<p>An interesting thought experiment on who constrains their behavior in the face of&nbsp;scarcity&#8230;</p>
<p>Also, related to taxes in general: if we have more regressive taxes (which most usage taxes are, despite their many benefits), then we need to offset that with progressive taxation elsewhere; the result is simply a neutral&nbsp;tax.</p>

<p>Somewhere along the line &#8220;we&#8221; (the technology people? the open source people? technorati?) were labelled as tending libertarian. Maybe by <span class="caps">ESR</span>, back when he was considered relevant to the community. As a thoroughly not-libertarian person this has frustrated&nbsp;me.</p>
<p>But I think, if we were to be labelled as anything, it should be this: technocrats. Not just because it has &#8220;techno&#8221; in the title. Programmers aren&#8217;t, as far as I can tell, more drawn to techno music than the general populace. You might call it meritocracy, but I find that idea vague, in exacty the way that does not fit with our beliefs. A technocracy (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technocracy) is rule-by-those-who-care-about-the-thing-they-are-ruling. A do-ocracy (http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Do-ocracy) is not that much different, really. A technocracy applies when a do-ocracy is no longer possible: do-ocracies work when the work exceeds the ability to perform the work. Introducing coercion (which eventually government must do), the importance of choices exceeds the burden of work, and a selection criteria must be applied; selection by peers to me means a technocracy. But to excel in a technocracy is as much a matter of will as skill, because I believe it is intrinsic that we desire to do that which we also excel at, and yet potential never results in accomplishment without effort. Meritocracy implies potential should lead to power, while a technocracy implies accomplishment should sustain&nbsp;power.</p>
<p>I think a technocratic perspective is more opinionated than it might seem. It is most certainly elitist. It aspires to benevolence. It requires a community of peers, perhaps even a hierachy of peers, a complex mesh of peers as domains cross each other and compromise must be found. And it still requires guards, ways of avoiding overreach. But underneath it all, technocracy is progressive (with a small P), modernistic. And amidst the tedium of the left-right debate I wish technocracy had a voice, a manifesto, a label for people to rally&nbsp;behind.</p>

<p>There&#8217;s a theory about praise and children, and how some praise can be counterproductive; I think this describes it, but I don&#8217;t have time to research now:&nbsp;http://nymag.com/news/features/27840/</p>
<p>What if this same concept was applied to nations and nationalism? I&#8217;ve thought about this for all of thirty seconds, but I think maybe it&#8217;s like a big deal. I&#8217;ll think it through more&nbsp;later.</p>

<p>The coworking this guy describes is coworking I could actually imagine being part&nbsp;of.</p>
<p>I am, it seems, an employee. The icon on this article stares at me, accusingly. But I am happily and employee. I hate being independent. It is perhaps because I hate commerce. Anyway, an&nbsp;aside.</p>
<p>Despite being an employee, I&#8217;m interested in coworking because otherwise I work at home. This is appreciated lately with a new baby at home, but ultimately I don&#8217;t like working at home. Coworking has some appeal, but I feel little draw toward any coworking spacing I see. What William describes in many spaces is a good description of my reluctance, though my reluctance is intuitive and he actually manages to put it into&nbsp;words.</p>
<p>I am if anything turned off by fancy spaces. If the community is true, the space should be cool through the will and involvement of that&nbsp;community.</p>
<p>Pretend-real-office stuff seems like envy; if you want to be a real company in a real office then you&#8217;ll never really appreciate where you are. And pretending that you are real&#8230; if you can&#8217;t tell customers a compelling story about what this coworking community is and what it means, that&#8217;s&#8230; unfortunate, a lack of pride, a lack of understanding about community. And while I believe mutual aid is an important part of community, networking feels vulgar in&nbsp;comparison.</p>
<p>And yet, whatever it might be, there needs to be hustle. Comfortable is not sustaining. How do you balance the desire to expand with the desire to build inward? Alienation gnaws at everything, it is the great destroyer of voluntary&nbsp;efforts.</p>
<p>But still&#8230; it doesn&#8217;t take many people at all to make something special. Most ambitions I see look outward, but perhaps that means that an ambition looking inward can be even more powerful. In this case, inward to the group, even to a group. But still the most challenging question is left: what&nbsp;group?</p>

<p>An intelligent discussion of the filter bubble:&nbsp;http://www.gabrielweinberg.com/blog/2011/06/the-real-filter-bubble-debate.html</p>
<p>I haven&#8217;t read the filter bubble (is it worth it?) but it has struck me as an unsophisticated approach to the issue. &#8220;Unsophisticated&#8221; as in &#8220;good enough to be a pundit&#8221; but not &#8220;good enough to impress me&#8221;. And in my filtered ego-centric world, impressing me is what&nbsp;matters.</p>
<p>Snarkiness aside, I think the article puts forward the questions about filtering&nbsp;well:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>a) which personal signals should be used; b) what controls should we (as users) have over how our personal signals are used; and c) how results that arise from the use of our personal signals should be&nbsp;presented</p>
</blockquote>
<p>With appropriate transparency I find the filtering&nbsp;unconcerning.</p>
<p>I also think filtering can be more than just unconcerning, but positive in all the ways that the Filter Bubble things it might be negative (such as increasing partisanship because of divergent senses of the truth bolstered by filtered media). There is the concept of the Overton Window (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overton_window): the range of ideas that are considered acceptable (or reasonable) in the current political climate. If you argue outside the Window - too far right, too far left - it can be like talking to a brick wall, and no one will take you&nbsp;seriously.</p>
<p>Each person has something like a window of ideas that they can meaningfully assimilate or even react to. They might be informed about other ideas (or not), but they aren&#8217;t ready to actually accept those ideas. There&#8217;s lots of ideas after all, the range of possible ideas is enormous, and to expect an open mind to a large portion of those ideas is perhaps asking too much. I also think it isn&#8217;t productive - debate should change minds, and if changing minds is impossible then it&#8217;s not really debate. Despite this many people enter into debates knowing full well that no change will happen. I do not care for these discussions, I find them a distracting vanity; and if the filter bubble excludes those, so be&nbsp;it.</p>
<p>The Overton Window is often visualized in terms of the left-right dichotomy, with unacceptable extremes on both ends. This makes sense in a singular discussion, the kind of discussion where everyone is participating together, like the Nightly News. With just one kind of discussion you have to find a continuous window, a range of acceptability. But of course real issues aren&#8217;t a range. There&#8217;s many ways of looking at real issues, there&#8217;s many manners of arguments, there&#8217;s many experiences that color people&#8217;s opinion. There&#8217;s no one window that can encompass&nbsp;what</p>

<p>Commenting (edit: maybe I should say &#8220;annotation&#8221;) on the web is my persistent nagging non-accomplishment. But&#8230; another&nbsp;idea:</p>
<p>There&#8217;s two concepts I see: one, you setup a page to receive annotations. Usually you focus on the parts that need annotating (like the content, and not the sidebar). Handy, but requires&nbsp;setup.</p>
<p>A second: you allow anything to be annotated anywhere. A parallel-web concept (e.g., SideWiki, but there&#8217;s been a ton of these over the years). The problem: this parallel web is almost completely empty. There&#8217;s not enough density of comments to make it&nbsp;useful.</p>
<p><span class="caps">OK</span>, a third emerging concept, which isn&#8217;t my new idea, but just occurs to me: third-party aggregation sites have become a kind of comment-on-the-web. E.g., you can add comments to a blog post, but another discussion entirely happens on Reddit around that same <span class="caps">URL</span>, and potentially a bunch of other sites. (Are there browser addons to see these? Depending on the content and the commenting forum, off-site comments are often much more&nbsp;interesting.)</p>
<p>A fourth concept: don&#8217;t try to create a parallel web, but make these annotations/comments into real documents. E.g., I comment on http://foo.com/something.html but my comments appear at http://somecommentsystem.com/ianb/foo.com/something.html and if I send that link to someone, then they&#8217;ll see the result (either in a static form, for posterity, or using an addon or bookmarklet they can see it in the live page). Then it becomes a simple tool, rather than a whole system. And coming back to the off-site comments, this is another kind of off-site comment (just one that is contextualized with the rendered&nbsp;page).</p>

<p><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>The fundamental value proposition is around privacy: it&#8217;s the opposite of Facebook and Twitter&#8217;s universal broadcast&nbsp;paradigm.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ugh. Privacy has stolen our minds, made social discussions among techies dumb. Frankly when it comes to privacy I think Zuckerberg is mostly right, and he has payed attention to what really matters. There&#8217;s a lot of surface area in these mediums, and interplay with the users and the medium itself. There&#8217;s a lot to consider. Privacy is dull in comparison. Privacy is based in fear and inaction and reluctance, our worse&nbsp;attributes.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve randomly tossed people into Circles, but for now it doesn&#8217;t mean much. It will mean something when I have a functional goal that I can accomplish with Circles. And I think they&#8217;ll be useful. I can use it like a mailing list, for instance. But privacy&#8230;&nbsp;eh.</p>

<p>I thought the latter part of the article did a good job of getting out of standard&nbsp;incentive-thinking.</p>
<p>Why is someone good at doing something? Maybe they&#8217;ve responded to incentives to develop themselves to satisfy market desires. But it seems more likely that the person has themselves been part of some positive feedback cycle of self-development. You can call that feedback cycle &#8220;passion&#8221; or &#8220;a love of the craft&#8221; or &#8220;flow&#8221; or &#8220;talent&#8221; or a bunch of things – and there probably are many distinct reasons to enter into that cycle, they aren&#8217;t just words for the same thing – but in the end there was self-motivation and a personal desire for improvement. Why would that stop? If you got to be good through that motivation, wouldn&#8217;t you want to keep satisfying&nbsp;it?</p>

<p>Hard work is hard, but I wonder if it truly requires an anti-social&nbsp;approach.</p>
<p>The nice thing if you are working in isolation is that everyone involved in your work environment is probably aligned towards a goal. Or at least we hope you yourself are aligned – and yet even that is hard to manage, as we all know from our own ability to distract&nbsp;ourselves.</p>
<p>An open office, messaging, all those distractions aren&#8217;t just distractions, they are external influences that aren&#8217;t designed to help you get <span class="caps">YOUR</span> work done. Someone else has a question to help them get <span class="caps">THEIR</span> work done. Someone else is monitoring your productivity to help them alleviate their own&nbsp;anxiousness.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not a big fan of pair programming, but I do like how it can lead to better focus. It&#8217;s like you are focus accountability partners. I also like ad hoc meetings setup for a specific purpose, if the purpose really is important for the participants I think it&#8217;s productive. And if the problem is really important, I like a meeting where we talk things through and then get quiet for a long time. We don&#8217;t give up. We don&#8217;t defer the problem, leave and go our separate ways. Part of doing hard work, in my experience, is loading up the tensions, piling up everything that makes it hard, and then finding the way out. It&#8217;s not always easiest to do that&nbsp;alone.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t think being a &#8220;jerk&#8221; is a personal trait, it&#8217;s an environmental&nbsp;result.</p>
<p>Sometimes people are very picky because they are trying to stonewall you. They come up with review comments that might be accurate, but aren&#8217;t actually intended to help the change land. Maybe they review just far enough to veto, and then you fix that and they review enough to veto again. That kind of jerk is not worth much, but it&#8217;s the malintent behind the impolite behavior that is the problem. Often the person is disengaged and disinterested in their&nbsp;job.</p>
<p>Sometimes people are become defensive and difficult because they don&#8217;t believe they are contributing enough compared to their past performance. I&#8217;ve seen a lot of people who did a lot of good work in the past, but aren&#8217;t doing well now. Maybe processes changed, maybe how the team makes priorities changed, maybe technologies changed, maybe they aren&#8217;t managing themselves well, maybe they are just depressed and having a hard time functioning. Maybe it&#8217;s compounded because their own displayed confidence backed them into a wall, and they can&#8217;t admit there&#8217;s something they don&#8217;t know or aren&#8217;t able to do, and so they can&#8217;t learn to do it. These jerks are &#8220;essential&#8221; (because they know stuff, maybe have authority), but not productive. Sometimes they stonewall to hide&nbsp;this.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s jerks who have their own agenda that doesn&#8217;t align with some of the people they are supposed to work with. It a matrixed organization everyone validly has independent agendas that cross with each other. Maybe they only feel personally responsible for product quality, while they are a gatekeeper for people who are supposed to deliver new functionality. Because of how authority may be setup, someone may feel trapped between two authorities (their boss and this gatekeeper) with no way to come to agreement on priorities. Usually this is a lack of understood overarching priorities from leadership. Sometimes without that in place the only way to &#8220;win&#8221; is to be&nbsp;difficult.</p>
<p>Personally I don&#8217;t have a problem working with abrasive personalities so long as we truly share a goal and are working towards it. Having a group of people who really share a goal is not as common as one would&nbsp;hope.</p>

<p>As a maker-turn-manager I&#8217;ve become skeptical of this perspective. I think it&#8217;s indulgent and misdirected. Yes, if I as a manager schedule your time, I&#8217;m probably not going to schedule it for your best performance. But I don&#8217;t think the problem that as a manager I don&#8217;t leave you giant blocks of uninterrupted time. It&#8217;s that as a manager I tend to interrupt your time with meetings that serve my role, and a manager&#8217;s role tends to be focused on prediction, expectations, upward-directed planning, balancing work, status, risk&#8230; all things that aren&#8217;t even intended to improve actual execution. In theory of course a manager is supposed to be focused on team performance and execution, but the heaviest pressure on a manager is about how the team fits into the larger organization, not how the team&nbsp;works.</p>
<p>If a maker&#8217;s days are interrupted by meetings that are genuinely structured to improve their execution, I don&#8217;t think the interruption is very concerning, and may be beneficial. This theory about a Maker&#8217;s Schedule, and these theories around attention, make these positive interruptions less likely to happen – the maker&#8217;s become skittish about all meetings, become reclusive, sometimes causing a downward spiral because the maker actually needs those meetings and becomes more reclusive out of shame because the maker is confused and performing poorly. Defensively the maker reacts against the structure that remains – the structure of meetings created by the manager, meetings which aren&#8217;t supportive, where the maker is not sufficiently engaged to feel confident in repurposing the meeting&#8230; but the dysfunction is that in the face of these meetings a better response would be more meetings, better meetings, meetings where the makers leave the meeting ahead of where they started instead of behind. But don&#8217;t expect the managers to call those meetings – frankly as a manager I often can&#8217;t make those meetings happen even when I want&nbsp;to.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll also copy a post I wrote on the topic&nbsp;(https://plus.google.com/u/0/+IanBicking/posts/jgJCdMkzyBE):</p>
<p>I&#8217;m somewhat pro-meeting, which maybe puts me at odds with the cultural norms of&nbsp;developers.</p>
<p>I think I realize some of the problem. Meetings tend to be called by managers. Managers have management goals. Process, deadlines, coordination, etc. The developer sits around in case they provide some important input on one of those topics, or to give status, or to commit to a deadline. Nothing in that kind of meeting helps the developer&#8217;s work. And the developer tries their best to withhold, to protect their own work, but also to protect the project which actually needs that&nbsp;output.</p>
<p>In a developer-oriented meeting the topics would be decisions to make, architectural choices to consider, noting places of tension where a creative solution could be helpful. In a developer meeting it is reasonable to take some time to look at code. To do a bit of research – right in the meeting – to answer a question. To brainstorm ideas. If a problem is hard, it is reasonable that everyone go silent for a minute and ponder the&nbsp;problem.</p>
<p>In The New Science of Building Great Teams (https://hbr.org/2012/04/the-new-science-of-building-great-te&#8230;) they discuss some evidence-based observations about communication patterns. In it they suggest that high levels of communication lead to more productivity. By developer sensibilities, very high levels. But mostly peer interactions – developers interacting with&nbsp;developers.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d really extend this to all the people engaged in making the product, design, user experience, user research, development, probably support and other roles. In an ideal model there would be dozens of meetings, as different sets of these people came together to talk about what is relevant to those groups of people. These meetings would not have clear and firm agendas, the product is the agenda, finding the agenda is some of the work of the&nbsp;meeting.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s easy to blame management for the unproductive meetings. We&#8217;re calling these snooze-fest status meetings. But I&#8217;d turn it around: professionals shouldn&#8217;t depend on management to initiate meetings. Sure management can try; I try to setup meetings I think will be productive for other people. The Standup is the quintessential example. But we know where those so often end up: as yet another management-led status meeting. And it&#8217;s a form without a clear purpose. Who should be in the standup? What should we talk about? When those things are defined by management we get management-style answers. Even better than trying to fix the standup, keep it from being necessary: make the meetings that help everyone do their work, where the topic is always execution and not prediction or planning or&nbsp;status.</p>
<p>With Project Managers and other professions focused on planning there is a danger that we defer to the specialists. But everything needs to be planned. The next line of code I write has to be planned. Developers have to be planners, every one of&nbsp;them.</p>

<p>If I was making an interactive command line, I think I&#8217;d want to do it all in shell. Let&#8217;s say it&#8217;s a <span class="caps">CLI</span> that interacts with a remote server, then I might have a &#8220;script&#8221; that &#8220;starts&#8221; a custom <span class="caps">CLI</span> by&nbsp;doing:</p>
<table class="highlighttable"><tr><td class="linenos"><div class="linenodiv"><pre>1
2
3
4
5</pre></div></td><td class="code"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="ch">#!/usr/bin/env bash</span>
<span class="nb">export</span> <span class="nv">REMOTE_ADDR</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">&quot;</span><span class="nv">$1</span><span class="s2">&quot;</span>

bash
</pre></div>
</td></tr></table>

<p>Now you do something&nbsp;like:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>$ server-cli https://myservice.com
service:$ which upload
/path/to/server-cli/commands/upload
$ upload ./my-file.png
uploading.......
</pre></div>


<p>All you are doing here is adding all your custom commands (which are just command line applications), and starting up the <span class="caps">CLI</span> by giving it some context of some sort. All I have here is \$REMOTE_ADDR (which by convention a command like upload would read), but you could have auth or&nbsp;whatever.</p>
<p>Along with this, you get a pretty workable programming language (shell), access to the local environment, access to the &#8220;standard library&#8221; of commands you know, and so&nbsp;on.</p>

<p>I personally am disappointed that there&#8217;s so little will to improve buses. Buses have a lot of good&nbsp;attributes:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Turn radius is pretty good: streetcars have 18-20m turn radiuses, buses are comfortable at 12m radius, doable at 9m, and can go lower. Buses are compatible with existing city&nbsp;forms.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Because of this you can change routes based on demand. This almost never happens, but it&nbsp;should.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Broken buses don&#8217;t break the&nbsp;line.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Express buses can coexist with local service&nbsp;buses.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Turns out passing is a useful&nbsp;feature!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It would be possible to responsively add buses to meet demand. Never happens, but&nbsp;possible.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Variable stop frequency is a possibility. If you are on a late-night bus in New York they&#8217;ll let you off at any corner you want. (Most cities lack this basic sense of decency, but I won&#8217;t claim we do buses&nbsp;right.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The vehicles are not proprietary. You don&#8217;t like your buses? Buy any brand you&nbsp;like!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>New manufactures could enter the market. Trains are regulated to a degree that makes it very difficult to enter the market. This is especially bad in the U.S., so maybe it&#8217;s unfair: we have terrible regulation, and local manufacture requirements. This has a lot to do with the high subsidies trains require: it requires so much political will that everyone wants a piece of the&nbsp;pie.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Buses don&#8217;t have to be inefficient. Intercity buses are often more fuel-efficient than intercity trains, for instance (I&#8217;m guessing this is mostly because they use variable pricing to run at capacity, but something like that is possible for transit&nbsp;too.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Rubber wheels are pretty awesome for stopping, and stopping is pretty awesome for not killing people. Trains are incompatible with humans and even cars except at very low speeds, and require intense separation, or barriers with long lengths of times to let traffic and pedestrians clear. Surface trains substantially hurt the walkability of their immediate&nbsp;surroundings.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Buses can run lines that are more dense than trains, which is important for people with disabilities. Most disabled people I see are using&nbsp;buses.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We really do need roads everywhere. I remember making SimCity cities with only trains, but that&#8217;s not a real thing. You need roads for emergency vehicles, trash collection, utilities and utility repair, your moving truck, and so on. I&#8217;d love to see roads scaled back, but they aren&#8217;t going to disappear, so let&#8217;s make the best of&nbsp;them.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Buses do absolutely suck. But I am not convinced they have to suck. Unfortunately transit systems (buses or trains) have no incentive to meet customer demand, their real customers are the government not the riders. Riders are a liability for transit systems, and so there&#8217;s painfully little&nbsp;innovation.</p>

<p>Underlying this sentiment is the idea that the poor are a monolith. That someone stealing from cars or someone with mental problems who can&#8217;t maintain a job or relationships is a good representation of &#8220;the&nbsp;poor&#8221;.</p>
<p>The guy in the article who had his <span class="caps">BMW</span> broken into can afford to be blasé about the incident - he&#8217;s insured, whatever was stolen he can replace without blinking an eye.

<p>I was reading &#8220;The Early History of Smalltalk&#8221; a while back (http://worrydream.com/EarlyHistoryOfSmalltalk/) by Alan Kay, and the thing that jumped out at me was goal-oriented methods (see the section &#8220;Object-oriented&#8221; Style). That is, when you are calling other code you don&#8217;t tell the other code how to do something – and of course you don&#8217;t go poking into what the other code &#8220;knows&#8221; (i.e., accessing properties on an object) – instead you say &#8220;please, make it this way&#8221;. The code may succeed or may fail, but you aren&#8217;t micromanaging the&nbsp;code.</p>
<p>From my time with Smalltalk I found this pattern quite remarkable, though also at times hard to trace. You&#8217;d tell an object to do something, and it might access some object it knows about, maybe do a test or guard, and then it would tell the other object to go do that thing. And the other object might in turn delegate, many levels deep. The result could be really incredible and compact, though it also felt like it wasn&#8217;t actually easier to understand. Kind of Ravioli Code (http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?RavioliCode), though not the kind of modern Ravioli Code you might see because someone takes <span class="caps">DRY</span> too seriously – instead it reminded me more of a mathematical proof. Mathematical proofs are really cool, but they do not contain the information necessary to reproduce them; a mathematical proof is the result of studying and pondering and struggling with a problem for a long time until you reduce it to something compact and beautiful. The result seems magical, but in part because you threw away all the struggling that produced the result. That&#8217;s what the core Smalltalk class hierarchy felt like to me; beautiful, maybe not reproducible, not always accessible. All of which is a critique of one place and time of code, and <span class="caps">OO</span> is bigger than that, but I suspect it&#8217;s also some of the result of created goal-oriented methods All The Way&nbsp;Down.</p>
<p>Functional programming can also be goal-oriented if you can reify all your goals, because ultimately that which isn&#8217;t reified (that is, made into data or state) can&#8217;t be the result of a function. I don&#8217;t have as intuitive a sense there, is goal-oriented functional programming an ideal people&nbsp;hold?</p>
<p>Another Smalltalk lens on <span class="caps">OO</span> is message-oriented programming, where you have a set of objects or actors which pass messages, but never directly &#8220;touch&#8221; each other, and in some sense objects are more autonomous than a conventional understanding of <span class="caps">OO</span>. This does not map well to functional programming – the purpose of messages to autonomous objects is to effect state, to make changes in the world. Of course that&#8217;s the purpose of all programming, so it&#8217;s not crazy. In some sense functional programming lifts the purposeful and useful outcomes of a program out of the programming, and into the environment. I would consider that a stronger contrast with <span class="caps">OO</span>.</p>

<p>After Engelbart&#8217;s group disbanded it seemed like he ended up in the wilderness for a long time, and focused his attention on management. I&#8217;ll project onto him and would guess that he felt more constrained by his social or economic context than he was by technology, that he envisioned possibilities that were unattainable for reasons that weren&#8217;t technical.

<p>The first time I heard about this approach was Boxer:&nbsp;http://edutechwiki.unige.ch/en/Boxer</p>
<p>Some more info here:&nbsp;http://lambda-the-ultimate.org/node/4695</p>

<p>It goes beyond framing a bit, making things like variables concrete (they are actual boxes that contain a value). But it doesn&#8217;t do full Scratch-style pluggable programming, the statements are still text, as in &#8220;Frame-Based&nbsp;Editing&#8221;.</p>

<p>In a discussion I had recently we started talking about metaprogramming, which in practice is only the tiniest and most minimal execution of the implied idea: writing programs that operate on programs. Modern convention is to treat programs as black boxes that only the developers of that specific program can hope to reason about. And so metaprogramming is when a programmer writes or very carefully uses a component that operates on the program, but the result is just the program – you can&#8217;t run the program without the applied metaprogramming nor can you apply metaprogramming to a program and expect it to work. Except&nbsp;debugging.</p>
<p>Underneath the suggestion in the paper I see something similar. &#8220;Programming&#8221; might be an overly specific term. But a call to apply reasoning to systems and computation. Not applying reasoning to specific systems, as a programmer might analyze or test a specific program (what we&#8217;re already doing), but to systems as a whole. I can see this in other computing developments. Operating systems are the result of reasoning about hardware. The result looks very different from coding directly to the hardware, especially in our mature state. But programs still are binaries with machine code. Before the <span class="caps">OS</span> of course was the program itself. And so what would it look like if we applied this kind of reasoning to&nbsp;programs?</p>
<p>But oh, we already apply so much reasoning to programming! But in a certain way. We apply reasoning to compilers, which programmers use as they will. We build libraries and hope they are used well. And then we pull these together to some actual purpose in the program. And we assemble programs into systems. Each step empowers the next layer, but we don&#8217;t apply (much) software to explore, verify, or extend these layers. Our tests are typically written as binary pass/fail systems, with no generalized attention to <span class="caps">WHY</span> something fails – and we can&#8217;t apply generalized attention because the program is too&nbsp;opaque.</p>

<p>In these plans it feels like the highest priority is to make the design comprehensible for the planners. An expression of incredible laziness. And still such a common planning behaviour. On a smaller scale you might look at one skyscraper and consider the raw quantity of human activity contained within, all utterly erased by the architecture so that every floor and window looks the same - what a&nbsp;loss!</p>
<p>On the level of roads and navigation we can start to consider ignoring comprehensibility entirely. With navigation systems and even more with automated vehicles we can traverse a city without understanding it. Who needs the strict hierarchy of transportation from the Radiant City? Or even the hierarchies we have&nbsp;now.</p>
<p>Transportation is the beginning, but commerce will follow - will we need the hierarchy of warehouses, big box stores, local shops, categories of retail&#8230;? New Urbanism principles may survive, but only as an aesthetic, urban planning as&nbsp;decoration.</p>
<p>The organic city structures we&#8217;ll see (organic because what use has nature ever had for comprehensibility?) could go more than one way. Like an algae bloom of suburbia, structure without character or meaning. Maybe suburbia is already an expression of this&nbsp;trend.</p>
<p>But if we don&#8217;t fetishize old patterns like New Urbanism, and we don&#8217;t create spiritually beige non-patterns like suburbia, what other structures do we have to meaningfully organize our cities? I&#8217;m somewhat at a loss. But then no one is asking me anyway&nbsp;;)</p>

<p>Something I&#8217;m coming to learn: for any bureaucratic system, those who are most capable of taking advantage of the system are the privileged. Every time we try to arrange a benefit for the poor, infirmed, disadvantaged, disabled, we create a tool for the more privileged to advance themselves. The poor hit a rough spot and they can&#8217;t hold onto their homes – only the well off can hold their property for decades. Even rent control: who is most able to ward off an eviction? Who can access the legal system? Who can mount their own defense? Who can see the machinations of their own landlord and work in advance to counter? At every turn, when we make a rule, we give a tool to those who can work with rules; if those people were at one time not privileged, they are privileged now, and have been for some&nbsp;time.</p>

<p>Probably like many of you I mostly hang out around middle class, highly involved parents. But sometimes I find myself around other parents who are not as involved. I think those other parents don&#8217;t see themselves as the primary impact on their children; they probably don&#8217;t see themselves as the primary impact even on their own&nbsp;lives.</p>
<p>Among my peer group there are kids with learning problems and disabilities and all sorts of things. And the parents are watching and notice these problems, and work hard to resolve the problems, and reach out (and know how to reach out) for help. Among those other parents many kids are fine, and will develop quite normally, but there are also kids with learning problems, disabilities, health problems – things that won&#8217;t just be fine without intervention. And I&#8217;ve repeatedly seen those other parents just not notice, to resign themselves (and thus their children) to these&nbsp;limits.</p>
<p>With this in mind I&#8217;ve realized a lot of rules and materials aren&#8217;t directed towards me or my peers. These &#8220;what your children should know by kindergarten&#8221; lists are mostly to catch the kids who are in real trouble, but their parents haven&#8217;t noticed. (The parents who notice don&#8217;t particularly need extra reminders that they need to give their children extra help.) A lot of programming and structure is intended to make up for a lack of structure for this particular group of&nbsp;kids.</p>
<p>The involved parents of course always make this about themselves (and me too). Because we&#8217;re involved, because we&#8217;re constantly asking &#8220;should I worry about this?&#8221;, because we believe we can make a difference through our effort. So the interventions intended to bring up one set of kids instead get applied – and applied most vigorously! – to an entirely different set of kids that probably didn&#8217;t need any of&nbsp;it.</p>
<p>And then we go on boards and talk about these lists and are shocked at how limited the expectations of a 4-year-old are (because the lists are intended only to catch kids in trouble) and we start to brag about our kids because we&#8217;re trying so hard to do the right thing and it&#8217;s never clear if we&nbsp;are.</p>

<p>On the public policy side, I have begun to wonder if empathy-based theories of social change get in the way of the goals of social justice movements. That is, social justice movements are pining after something they cannot achieve through empathy, and are distracted from their goals as a&nbsp;result.</p>
<p>A rather pedestrian example, I was having a discussion about transit planning with a group of people. Despite the less than enthusiastic reception transit gets from typical middle class white people, there&#8217;s still a sense that the system is biased towards them, and doesn&#8217;t serve communities of color/etc as well. The modern urbanist sensibility here is to have community engagement, neighborhood meetings, etc. All very grassroots. But who shows up to these things? Older white educated people mostly, usually with negative opinions to share. In this discussion people were very concerned about how we could get more representation from other communities, how we could hold more of these meetings in relevant neighborhoods, at times when working people could attend,&nbsp;etc.</p>
<p>The underlying logic of this participatory model is basically empathetic. People individually express themselves so that they can influence each other and the decision makers. They do this through empathy. The decision makers are generally more white, more privileged, more educated (and we can&#8217;t expect to recruit more uneducated urban planners!) These people will be more receptive to perspectives coming from people like them. The response is often to increase the participation, be more inclusive, broaden the perspective. But minorities will always lose out, increasing participation doesn&#8217;t disrupt that empathy bias. You can have more meetings in neighborhoods with minorities, and the white people even in those neighborhoods will still out-influence the&nbsp;minorities.</p>
<p>Can we fix the empathy problem in policing by getting more minorities on the force? That has not seemed very effective. Can we create better services for minorities by listening to their needs and responding? Eh, the best I&#8217;ve seen is people feel listened to, which is too often the substitute for real change. So I wonder if instead we stop relying on empathy in these circumstances, as emotionally attached as we are on the idea of&nbsp;empathy.</p>
<p>Going back to the original example, if we want to design a decent transit system we need to ditch the community feedback and go to data. In that model everyone is counted the same. Hidden bias isn&#8217;t enough to create a model where a black person as 3/5 of a white person. And of course people still select models based on feedback, and that feedback will be biased, but it&#8217;s way better than what we have now. Instead of trying to fix bias in order to fix social injustice, I think we&#8217;d do better constructing systems that remove the effect of bias in those places – which is the opposite of what most social justice advocates intend when they suggest we address the &#8220;root&#8221; of the&nbsp;problem.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t think the bystander effect is nearly as significant as common wisdom would imply. People don&#8217;t respond not because they think someone else will, but because they don&#8217;t understand what&#8217;s going on. I live in an urban area, and I pay attention to noises, but almost every time I hear a scream and investigate it&#8217;s some boisterous teenagers or some similar phenomena. If I knew the person was requesting help – even if I don&#8217;t know <span class="caps">WHY</span> they are requesting help – I would&nbsp;respond.</p>
<p>The wiki page largely confirms this as well: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bystander_effect#Emergency_ver&#8230; – most of the factors which encourage response by bystanders would be satisfied by this&nbsp;system.</p>

<p>I come from Minneapolis and moved back here as an adult. A few&nbsp;observations:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Of course lots of stuff still sucks, this is a low bar for miracles&nbsp;;)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The region of influence is huge – going west the next real city is Seattle. This has always been an important part of the city, first for lumber, then agriculture, and now medicine and&nbsp;education.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sure there&#8217;s a brain drain, but we also have that large region draining into this city. Rural areas produce smart and interesting people as&nbsp;well.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Government is quite competent. I get a broad and consistent sense that people who work in government, elected or not, see it as a form of&nbsp;service.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Government is generally fiscally conservative. Not bullshit fiscal conservatism, but the kind that keeps expenditures low <span class="caps">AND</span> taxes high. As a result the squeezes we have had (the same everyone has had lately) haven&#8217;t been too&nbsp;destructive.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Minneapolis is embedded in a quite large county, that includes a lot of suburbs and even some rural areas (even if those are dwindling). Minneapolis is not the majority of the county, population or area. I know many urbanists get excited about unified governments like Indianapolis where county and city take on the same boundaries. I think that&#8217;s unsafe – you can get shit done, but shit can also fall apart. St. Louis is a good&nbsp;counterexample.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We&#8217;re even less unified than that, because Minneapolis and St. Paul make up one metro area, the two being largely indistinguishable from each other. I liked this opinion piece on the problems with city government: http://www.slate.com/blogs/moneybox/2013/07/19/urban_malgove&#8230; – specifically the problem with a lack of political competition in core cities. Like most big cities Minneapolis is almost one-party (there&#8217;s a Green Party that manages to just barely hold on to relevancy), but the competition between Minneapolis and St. Paul I think helps keep both of them honest. It&#8217;s a friendly competition, but it helps moderate things. For instance, a useful critique lately has been that St. Paul Public Schools manages to spend considerably less and has better outcomes, for a student body that looks largely the same. I&#8217;m hoping we explore that&nbsp;further.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cost of living isn&#8217;t that low. Lower than San Francisco, sure, but everything in the <span class="caps">U.S.</span> is cheaper than that. We don&#8217;t have the bursts of speculation that drive prices up in weird ways, and we have the naturally suppressive power of our weather, but it&#8217;s not&nbsp;cheap.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There are many criticisms of the disparities here – that Minnesota generally and Minneapolis along with it have a greater difference in outcomes for whites and minorities, across many measures. Some of these are problematic (I&#8217;m very unhappy with our policing), but some of the criticism I think is unwarranted. We have a large Somali population, for instance. They are struggling. But they <span class="caps">JUST</span> <span class="caps">MOVED</span> <span class="caps">FROM</span> <span class="caps">SOMALIA</span>. Families torn apart, no background in an educational or economic system like here, I&#8217;m certain many people hold trauma from their experiences in Somalia. Of course they aren&#8217;t doing awesomely. But they are doing okay, and all considered that&#8217;s kind of incredible. And that population is in Minnesota <span class="caps">ENTIRELY</span> because of our social services. And I&#8217;m glad this community can use its wealth to help these people, but the talk of disparities is just off. I think this is largely true for many of the minorities here who are fairly recent immigrants, we could do better but we&#8217;re also doing good by them. (The same assessment doesn&#8217;t really apply to Native Americans, that&#8217;s a sad situation where this community is not living up to its&nbsp;obligations.)</p>

<p>A friend of mine posted her daughter&#8217;s homework, which had a math problem like &#8220;What is 17 - 9?&#8221; then &#8220;Explain.&#8221; Her daughter wrote something like &#8220;because it is&#8221;. Which is all the damn explanation that should require. The friend did admit that her daughter later added an explanation. (To be fair, I think they were looking for something like &#8220;because 9 + 8 = 17&#8221; which isn&#8217;t entirely&nbsp;unreasonable.)</p>
<p>This is a pattern I have seen more, and I think is part of Common Core more generally. It makes some sense, but it also feels like they are aping good education. Yes, it is important that students have more than one way to approach a problem, that they understand the truth of the answer and not just the mechanism to produce it, and it is good if a child can work at articulating their thought processes. But, acknowledging that, the Common Core response is: add some more questions requiring the student to do those things. It&#8217;s not&nbsp;supportive.</p>
<p>Now, back to boys and girls. These vague requirements, these attempts to induce &#8220;critical thinking&#8221;, are not well defined, and the only demonstrable result is whether you can please the teacher. (<span class="caps">IMHO</span> in a better approach a student would use multi-step thinking, construct and answer their own problems, and ultimately produce a result that could be externally and objectively validated, ideally supporting iterative development and adding complexity.) Boys are not very good at pleasing teachers, certainly not nearly as good as girls are. A boy would be less likely to amend his answer to satisfy the absurd question, less likely to try to read the teacher&#8217;s mind to figure out what output the teacher was trying to get. A boy is less likely to match the girl on language skills at some of those ages, and then can&#8217;t even excel at something that isn&#8217;t language based, like math. Everything becomes an essay question, and if you aren&#8217;t good at essays not only won&#8217;t you be graded well, you may not enjoy the work itself. And the harder you are pushed towards performing the more you will be pushed towards your weakness (the flaw that is keeping you from being graded well); this may improve your grades at that moment, but at the cost of long term&nbsp;learning.</p>
<p>Kids have a lot of time to learn what they need to know. So much time&#8230; when people talk about lengthening school days and years, it makes me think about expecting people to work late to increase output. It&#8217;s not smart. But worse it reveals a lack of value being placed on the time already spent. But if you let a child learn what is right for them to learn, when it is right to learn it, there&#8217;s so much time for them to become eventually well&nbsp;rounded.</p>
<p>It sucks for girls too. They cope better, they are better equipped to conform. They are also cursed with that ability to conform. The bad results for boys often involve obvious external measures, like failing, disciplinary measures, testing poorly, struggling after school. The bad results for girls are often more internal, a fragile identity, not nurturing their own autonomy, feeding on external rather than internal&nbsp;validation.</p>
<p>This is why as a parent I opt out of public&nbsp;education.</p>

<p>Seeing this Brave New World thing pop up again. <span class="caps">OMG</span> sheeple wake up! People have become passive, drowned in&nbsp;irrelevance!</p>
<p>I find this line of discourse dehumanizing. &#8220;People&#8221; apparently includes everyone but the reader. Some would claim this is the conceit of such critique, a claim that only the reader sees the world for what it really is, the reader (and writer) are better than everyone else. But this kind of critique has gone on too long for me to feel this way – instead I think these critiques erase the reader, erase the idea of constructive engagement, they don&#8217;t say &#8220;you, reader, are the smart one!&#8221; instead they say &#8220;you are stupid and purposeless, not even worthy of critique, instead I shall turn my eye to only the unnamed&nbsp;masses!&#8221;</p>
<p>People need to stop talking about &#8220;people&#8221;. Neil Postman should stop talking about &#8220;people&#8221;. Have the guts to say who you are talking about. Or if more likely you are only talking about archetypes, step up and acknowledge the universal inapplicability of archetypes to real people, each of whom is better than your out-of-focus description. When you multiple out individuals into a group you don&#8217;t get a teaming mass – maybe <span class="caps">YOU</span> can only appreciate those individuals as a teaming mass, but don&#8217;t project the limits of your perception onto those individuals. Life is bigger than any one goddamned sci-fi&nbsp;story.</p>

<p>In the marketplace consumer expectations can get higher, a sense of entitlement develops, and that entitlement can be the valid effect of genuine progress. Not because the providers have to satisfy our sense of entitlement, but because they do, because that&#8217;s what it takes to compete until at some point that&#8217;s what&#8217;s expected just to play the game. Food providers at some point stopped competing on food safety because everyone demanded everything be safe. We started expecting cars to be very reliable, and if someone makes an unreliable car then fuck caveat emptor, it&#8217;s not going to become a matter of whether some consumers are willing to make that compromise and some are not – instead your brand becomes shit and you have to beg people to come back, if you can at all. Right now we don&#8217;t have that expectation about APIs; but some people want us to, we are moving that direction, and maybe we will get there. Or maybe we&#8217;ll get somewhere else; progress however ensures that we will get somewhere, that consumers will find something new about which to feel&nbsp;entitled.</p>
<p>And yeah, these companies don&#8217;t &#8220;owe&#8221; us anything, but consumers (even the subset of developer-consumers) can still get pissed off at them and say shit and that&#8217;s the fucking market. And maybe it won&#8217;t mean anything, maybe it&#8217;ll all fade away&#8230; and maybe it won&#8217;t. That&#8217;s the risk those brands are taking. It&#8217;s our market-based prerogative to bitch about whatever the hell we want to bitch about, using whatever hyperbole we want, with any sense of entitlement that we&#8217;ve&nbsp;acquired.</p>
<p>If someone starts sending mail bombs to these companies because they aren&#8217;t tending their APIs as we&#8217;d like, then that&#8217;s coercion. But there&#8217;s no coercion here, this is just people offering their opinions. So quit yer whining about our whining, the internet has entitled us to whine as much as we fucking want to, and has offered market-based ways to lift or bury that&nbsp;whining.</p>

<p>This is a good critique of the form of Bill Nye&#8217;s anti-creationist screed:&nbsp;http://jasonlefkowitz.net/2012/08/bill-nye-demonstrates-how-&#8230;</p>
<p>The form of his argument only encourages the conflict. He clearly feels contempt towards creationists, and even towards those who sympathize with them. As soon as you&#8217;ve shown contempt you&#8217;ve given up on convincing anyone of anything, and are just cheering on your&nbsp;side.</p>
<p>A serious attempt at promoting evolution would emphasize how you can resolve the tension between the theory of evolution and a strong belief in Christianity and The Bible. (There&#8217;s no reason to pretend this is a general issue, it&#8217;s a Christian issue:&nbsp;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Level_of_support_for_evolution#&#8230;)</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not a Christian, so I can&#8217;t write something more authentic than what Bill Nye might (though I damn well could write something less offensive). But I can imagine what the intellectual tensions are. I made an attempt (https://plus.google.com/104537541227697934010/posts/TnMt9Wgf&#8230;), something&nbsp;like:</p>
<p>To convince someone of evolution, as a Christian, I&#8217;d want to emphasize a reverence for the world as God created it, that He teaches us through the world around us, and that learning from and of that world could never be in contradiction with His word, in the Bible or as shown to us through our faith. The world is full of contradictory messages and lessons, we can&#8217;t always expect to decide that one is right and another is&nbsp;wrong.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d want to probe how the person has chosen to resolve the tension between Bible-as-fact and Bible-as-historical-document. For example, the Bible in many places talks freely and without condemnation about slavery, and clearly this does not fit with a modern understanding of Christian morality. I would hope that the person has seriously considered this problem and come to a resolution. I would hope to find a way to fit evolution, and ongoing scientific discovery in general, into that intellectual&nbsp;template.</p>
<p>Some Creationists might claim, for instance, that something as complicated as the eye could not be made through the incremental changes of evolution – it had to be designed. But this is a terribly limited notion of God. Could not God create a mechanism that would lead to the design of His choosing? Is there a mechanism so complicated that He could not conceive of it and create&nbsp;it?</p>
<p>There is a story of creation in the Bible. It is not a recipe of how to create a world. It is a message given to us to explain the world, a world that we cannot ever fully know. We&#8217;ve found tensions in that story. Consider for instance dinosaur fossils. Some people have considered this and read Genesis, and decided that dinosaurs must have lived in the Garden Of Eden, or been wiped out by the Great Flood. Does the Bible say this? No. There is more in the world than is in the Bible. Does the Bible talk of electricity, or about germs? No. Would we try to create a Biblical basis for this phenomena? No. The Bible covers the entirety of the creation of the Earth in one chapter, would we expect it to be comprehensive? It is our burden to resolve the world we see with the Bible as written. Some decide to ignore the world. This is a lazy approach, God did not give us the world in all its fullness just for us to ignore&nbsp;it.</p>

<p>Coincidentally I just came upon the term &#8220;Concerted Cultivation&#8221; (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concerted_cultivation) which describes the modern middle class typical parenting, the very thing that leaves kids with little time to play. Working back from that you get to the book Unequal Childhoods which contrasts middle class and working class parenting (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unequal_Childhoods#Parenting_St&#8230;). I find the contrast&nbsp;interesting:</p>
<p><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>Concerted Cultivation: The parenting style, favored by middle-class families, in which parents encourage negotiation and discussion and the questioning of authority, and enroll their children in extensive organized activity participation. This style helps children in middle-class careers, teaches them to question people in authority, develops a large vocabulary, and makes them comfortable in discussions with people of authority. However, it gives the children a sense of&nbsp;entitlement.</p>
<p><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>Achievement of Natural Growth: The parenting style, favored by working-class and lower-class families, in which parents issue directives to their children rather than negotiations, encourage the following and trusting of people in authority positions, and do not structure their children&#8217;s daily activities, but rather let the children play on their own. This method has benefits that prepare the children for a job in the &#8220;working&#8221; or &#8220;poor-class&#8221; jobs, teaches the children to respect and take the advice of people in authority, and allows the children to become independent at a younger&nbsp;age.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8230;</p>
<p>When contrasted against Achievement of Natural Growth it&#8217;s not so surprising that parents have decided to take another path. Simple romanticism about the past isn&#8217;t really that helpful. Just kick the kid out of the house and let them play? People talk about the lack of peers that aren&#8217;t similarly scheduled up, but I see kids all the time who are left free&#8230; and I&#8217;m not comfortable with how those kids are developing in that environment. Not that they aren&#8217;t fine playmates, but it&#8217;s not a kind of parenting I would want to imitate. And a lot of the efforts pushing for more structured time (more afterschool activities, full day kindergarten, universal preschool) are directed towards those kids that need it. But of course we all get washed up in it, even if increased structure is only needed by a segment of the&nbsp;population.</p>
<p>There are other models. Consider for instance Tools Of The Mind (http://www.toolsofthemind.org/), a preschool program that has shown surprising success. It incorporates a lot of pretend play, but adds structure to that pretend play. But it&#8217;s not authoritarian structure. Adults are really important to children, we have a lot to offer. We can enhance play, get kids out of ruts, enhance the environment, help kids match up their desires with productive paths of learning. Which also means giving them independence at the right time. And sometimes at the wrong time. And sometimes kids need to be understimulated. But it&#8217;s not that&nbsp;simple.</p>
<p>From the article: &#8220;You can’t teach creativity; all you can do is let it blossom. Little children, before they start school, are naturally creative.&#8221; I don&#8217;t buy that. Teaching creativity might be going a bit far, but it can absolutely be nurtured and inspired. Children, when just left alone, <span class="caps">DO</span> <span class="caps">NOT</span> <span class="caps">DO</span> <span class="caps">WELL</span>. I know just interjecting myself in a kids play for 30 seconds, at the right time, can considerably improve the creativity of their play. My nephew has been pretty into playing with blocks lately, but kind of repeating himself. I started making a bridge with a ramp, and he&#8217;s been obsessed with those forms for the last few days, trying new configurations, larger structures, bridges across corners, all sorts of stuff. Real creativity, he&#8217;s not just copying what I did. But he needed a little&nbsp;inspiration.</p>
<p>Do you just let kids work out all their problems between each other on their own? Sometimes kids work things out well. Sometimes they fight, often they bully, sometimes they are deliberately cruel, or depressingly meek. Setting up a bunch of rules is a bad solution too. Never hit! Now you can&#8217;t play fight with paper towel rolls. And you can&#8217;t learn how to interact physically without hurting each other. Always share! Or: always ask before taking! Or: turns! But sometimes one kid really wants something, and the other kid just happens to be holding that thing. Or sometimes a kid is just immitating, they ignored the toy until they saw someone else enjoying it. But the negotiated response is more sophisticated than any rule. Ask, trade, offer, come up with a creative way to both play with the toy. Acknowledge that not all kids communicate well with language, but body language is often more than enough to work on. But this doesn&#8217;t happen on its own. As the kids get older, they don&#8217;t communicate constructively on their own, or resolve their own conflicts, but they can do those things. They need help. Not rules, not structures to define their interactions, but they need engaged adults (or older&nbsp;children).</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t really disagree with this article. But it&#8217;s a critique that lacks empathy with the parental decisions that got us to where we are, and it does not respond to the concerns those parents have had. I think there&#8217;s a way to achieve both, parenting isn&#8217;t a choice somewhere on the line between two extremes, there&#8217;s no limit to the number of novel and engaged choices available to&nbsp;us.</p>

<p>I am disappointed when I hear the term &#8220;socio-economic factors&#8221; in discussions of education. First, as if &#8220;economic&#8221; wasn&#8217;t enough you add in &#8220;socio&#8221; to create a term that means &#8220;factors coming from every part of a person&#8217;s life&#8221;. Of course there are socio-economic&nbsp;factors.</p>
<p>But I dislike it particularly because often it feels like a statement: we don&#8217;t know what the causes are (which is why we make the weakest possible claim by using this incredibly expansive category), and we aren&#8217;t going to try to find&nbsp;out.</p>
<p>So I particularly appreciate this program, and the research it is based upon. We have a pretty well identified phenomena: talking a lot to kids, at a young age, helps them. A lot. And some people talk to their kids a lot more than other people. We should delight in this finding! We have a pretty clear way to identify a lot of kids whose lives could be greatly improved through changes in their parents&#8217; behavior, and that change is widely&nbsp;accessible.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s this kind of finding that penetrates &#8220;socio-economic factors&#8221; and in the process identifies something&nbsp;actionable.</p>

<p>These comments would be a lot more interesting if people identified what was cool rather than just bitching about ego or syntax or licensing. I&#8217;m not going to be using the Wolfram Language, but I&#8217;d love to identify the best ideas from it. And it&#8217;s a different enough language that I am confident there are interesting ideas in&nbsp;it.</p>
<p>My own&nbsp;contribution:</p>
<p>Idly looking about I come upon this page, which is not particularly notable:&nbsp;https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/Sow.html</p>
<p>What is notable is this&nbsp;example:</p>
<p>In: Reap[Sow[a]; b; Sow[c]; Sow[d]; e]
Out: {e, {{a, c,&nbsp;d}}}</p>
<p>Reap/Sow ss a funny language feature that I haven&#8217;t imagined before, but that&#8217;s not really the point. The point is that this is a runnable example – that&#8217;s actually what is output. Typically when you run something like that you get &#8220;NameError: a is not defined&#8221;. And &#8220;a&#8221; here is really a variable, of sorts – it&#8217;s not a string or symbol (at least not a symbol in the sense that we know them in&nbsp;programming).</p>
<p>Given this, snippets of code are just as executable as entire programs. Every expression is like a function with the free variables as its parameters, and a sequence of expressions is a bit like function&nbsp;composition.</p>
<p>This is all natural from the perspective of mathematic notation. In a more traditional programming environment I think it&#8217;s reminiscent of partial evaluation: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partial_evaluation – where you analyze a program and execute expressions opportunistically. It&#8217;s really almost the same as partial evaluation, but the Wolfram Language knows a lot more about how you can execute different combinations of expressions than a typical language. A typical language does not really &#8220;believe&#8221; that (a+b) and (b+a) are equivalent. It doesn&#8217;t know how to relate different operations. Nor do normal languages have a concept of simplification, so they can&#8217;t speculatively try other arrangements (where none in isolation is clearly better or simpler than another) to see if simplifications are&nbsp;possible.</p>

<p>First, there is no confirmation that people&#8217;s lives were just as fulfilling before the development of now-modern <span class="caps">US</span> communities. There is evidence that people did not like their living situation, and pursued other living situations. That&#8217;s how this all happened. There are storylines that assume that all those people are stupid rubes conned into something they didn&#8217;t really want, but I find those offensive to my democratic sensibilities. Well&#8230; it&#8217;d be okay if they were offensive, but they also are&nbsp;far-fetched.</p>
<p>But more important right now: we can&#8217;t just undo this. Metropolitan areas have become much larger than they were before, and you can&#8217;t squeeze all that development into old boundaries or even old forms. There can&#8217;t be one center to a metropolitan&nbsp;area.</p>
<p>And even the idea of local centers supposes that there are no useful decisions to make, that all providers of a service are equivalent except for their location. There will be a Catholic church in your neighborhood, but will there be a Baha&#8217;i temple? Can you get your kid to the daycare you want, then get yourself to the job you want, and get home, and have your partner do much the same, all within your local center or the limited mass transit connections you might find between centers? Is the entire concept of Costco wrong? Because there can&#8217;t be Costco without decentralized multi-use transportation&nbsp;methods.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s lots of smaller (single-center) towns with a nice downtown, and a crappy strip area elsewhere. In those towns everyone shops in the crappy strip, because they want a nice big grocery store with good prices, and you just don&#8217;t get that with a local/small grocery store. And businesses that provide real value want to build new buildings, and it&#8217;s damn hard to build the right building in built-up cores. Maybe resolvable, but it&#8217;s hard, and regressing to older forms won&#8217;t do&nbsp;it.</p>

<p>I remain consistently unclear what is the take-away is with discussions of Male Privilege. Are men supposed to feel guilty, and by carrying around that guilt they will act better? It&#8217;s often said that it &#8220;should be acknowledged&#8221; but what then? A lot of men (at times myself as well) bristle at this stuff, but at least for me it&#8217;s the sense that there are unspoken accusations underneath the discussion. I don&#8217;t get the point of acknowledgement alone, and since I don&#8217;t understand the point I&#8217;m inclined to infer there&#8217;s an unspoken motivation behind the&nbsp;discussion.</p>
<p>If the point is &#8220;we should be sensitive to one another&#8221; then yes, absolutely. I personally try hard to do this, towards women, towards beginners, towards people with other domain expertise, towards people with social anxiety&#8230; there&#8217;s a whole bunch of people who have different needs, and programming communities have their own quirky mix. It&#8217;s hard, I forget, other people forget, finding a balance between empathy and boundaries can be awkward at times&#8230; but eliminating the awkwardness or uncomfortable events is something I personally don&#8217;t try to do. Maybe because my own personal demon is alienation, and I know those boundaries are dangerous for me &#8212; they allow me to stick to a comfort zone that I know I need to push my way out&nbsp;of.</p>
<p>But&#8230; privilege&#8230; I just don&#8217;t know where that fits into this. There&#8217;s lots of specific issues I understand and can engage with. Impostor syndrome (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome) for instance &#8212; this is something I&#8217;ve heard a lot of women feel quite strongly, even in cases when I know the person should not feel that way. I&#8217;ve felt it too, but I know it&#8217;s felt more strongly by many women, and if I keep it in mind maybe I can do something positive with that knowledge at some time, to reassure, or perhaps to push someone further knowing they might be self-limiting themselves for the wrong&nbsp;reason.</p>
<p>And in these discussions I&#8217;ve heard other useful anecdotes&#8230; but in these lists (the article and the list of Male Privileges)&#8230; not really. It feels like there&#8217;s two&nbsp;categories:</p>
<ol>
<li>Don&#8217;t be a jerk. Fine, I&#8217;ll try not to be. Sometimes I might be. I&#8217;m sorry, I&#8217;m only human, I will accept criticism if it is&nbsp;offered.</li>
</ol>
<p>There&#8217;s also a message: don&#8217;t let other people be jerks. I&#8217;m not sure how I feel about this. If I feel strongly like both I and the possible-jerk are really members of the same community, then I would like to make the community better. But I have no interest in getting outraged because some dude somewhere said something offensive. Like the comment sections in many gender-diversity-related articles get filled with sexist bullshit (or worse)&#8230; I don&#8217;t know who those people are, I don&#8217;t recommend anyone even read that shit, and having absolutely no investment in that transient community of commenters I don&#8217;t see what I (or frankly anyone) should try to do about it. Just shut the fucking comments&nbsp;down.</p>
<ol>
<li>The message to respect boundaries and be professional. I&#8217;m simply not okay with this one. This isn&#8217;t just a profession for me, and that&#8217;s true of my community (and most open source related communities). I see other professional communities and I am totally disinterested. To be fair, in those professionalized communities there are a lot more women. But that&#8217;s a tradeoff I&#8217;m not willing to make. If I or any other member of the community wishes to profess, on a personal channel (like a Twitter account) that they find women attractive, so be&nbsp;it.</li>
</ol>
<p>Truly misogynist stuff isn&#8217;t okay (and that does occur, <span class="caps">IRC</span> can be particularly bad) and some awareness could be useful there, though I think outrage is not particularly helpful &#8212; it invokes defensiveness instead of empathy. Outrage strikes me as more to the emotional benefit of the person who is outraged than it is of benefit to the&nbsp;community.</p>

<p>If we ever make robots that truly take care of our needs - especially our emotional needs - we will also have to make them so it appears it is really they who need us. They will have to seem incapable, by a hidden design, to make do without&nbsp;us.</p>
<p>This is not because we need them to be incapable of rising up. Rather it is so we can feel needed. If they are to take care of our emotional needs, the need to be needed is great among&nbsp;them.</p>
<p>Industrial robots, well that&#8217;s something quite&nbsp;different.</p>
<hr>
<p>Is there a closed form of&nbsp;reality?</p>
<hr>
<p>Unpopular opinion: female characters often fall flat because they are written without initiative (there&#8217;s some word I can&#8217;t remember&#8230;&nbsp;Autonomy?)</p>
<p>But they are often written without autonomy because they are written without true&nbsp;responsibility.</p>
<p>They are often written without responsibility because that is the moral cover we&#8217;ve all agreed&nbsp;on.</p>
<hr>
<p>Imagine you set up a little group. Let&#8217;s call them Masons. You help each other out. Even unfairly. It&#8217;s like a conspiracy, but just one of mutual&nbsp;benefit.</p>
<p>Seems wrong but why? You can know what each other wants and work towards that for each&nbsp;other.</p>
<p>Masons are one example. A family or tribe can be&nbsp;another.</p>
<p>If we don&#8217;t have it, what do we replace it with? Something &#8220;fair&#8221; but we don&#8217;t even know what anyone wants then. We don&#8217;t work towards each other&#8217;s good, we work towards some abstract idea if good that doesn&#8217;t match&nbsp;anyone.</p>
<p>Which is why it is so vulnerable to say what you&nbsp;want.</p>
<hr>
<p>Being stoned gives me a triangulation on my soul. This is not my true soul, yet neither is my sober self. Each of those is just a feedback cycle of purported observation on one&#8217;s&nbsp;self.</p>
<p>But my self&#8230; That is something quite different than even my perception of my self. I don&#8217;t know if we can understand or describe that true self - if we&#8217;re stuck with our illusionary self descriptions - but I suspect we can, that we just haven&#8217;t tried yet, haven&#8217;t figured out what that true soul&nbsp;is</p>
<p>But I digress&#8230; I think the teatollers problem is that they only see it as a linear space, you can only be closer our further from your true self, not a multidimensional&nbsp;space.</p>
