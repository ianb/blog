        <div class="entry-content"><p>Ah, if I was to start a&nbsp;school&#8230;</p>
<p>Watching my nephew enter kindergarten, and thinking about my own daughter going to school in a few years, I feel disempowered by this. As a parents of a toddler, right now my wife and I have incredible power over how she is raised.  Some people bristle at this choice, at all the obsession over parenting; I don&#8217;t, I think this is important, I think being engaged in the process is important, for my daughter and future children and for us as parents.  We&#8217;re building a <em>family</em>, to all of our&nbsp;benefit.</p>
<p>This sense of control seems to wane as children get older.  School is a big part of that.  We give up our children to other people, and not just to people but to <em>systems</em>.  Teachers are chosen mostly by lot. If you find the school you want your child to go to, it may or may not be possible.  And yet more lotteries.  If you have hustle you can win these lotteries, stuff the ballots, find the&nbsp;exception.</p>
<p>So I&#8217;ve been thinking: should I be giving up this choice?  Should I be deferring to others, or to society or&nbsp;government?</p>
<p>To imagine starting a school seems like a fantasy, I have a hard time even taking myself seriously.  But it&#8217;s not impossible.  And so I&#8217;ve been thinking about what that school might&nbsp;be.</p>
<p>There would probably be a basis of certain traditional academics. Kids need to learn to read, need to learn to add and learn a bunch of other stuff.  But I&#8217;d like to see these traditional academics as a fallback, as the approach you take when something important isn&#8217;t going to happen&nbsp;otherwise.</p>
<p>I believe mixing kids of different ages is really important.  The best peer for a 6-year-old isn&#8217;t just 6-year-olds, nor is the best peer for a 12-year-old exclusively other 12-year-olds.  Younger children have a lot to learn from older children, and when older children have a chance to teach (and take some responsibility for) younger children they learn a tremendous amount&nbsp;too.</p>
<p>But why stop with kids?  Why do we partition children from adults, leaving only teachers?  Adults are good people too, they can demonstrate mature interactions, they can be helpful and important people in a child&#8217;s life.  As one of this generation&#8217;s non-traditional workers (I work at home, in a small office in the attic), what if I worked in the school itself?  Not work for the school, just work in the school.  I would of course participate in the school, but even when I wasn&#8217;t doing something specific I could still be part of the school&nbsp;culture.</p></div>
