        <div class="entry-content"><h2>So What Does This Look&nbsp;Like?</h2>
<p>So far I&#8217;ve written about abstract qualities of the experience.  What would it actually look&nbsp;like?</p>
<h3>Privacy Through&nbsp;Notification</h3>
<p>Minimal interfaces are cool.  Especially when you are working with something that <em>adds</em> to a page.  But we&#8217;re talking about potentially pretty significant privacy leaks here, even security problems depending on how much the collaborator can&nbsp;do.</p>
<p>The primary way I think we can address this is by making sure the collaboration interface is clear, ubiquitous, and <em>does not</em> fade into the background.  Whenever you are doing something, it should be clear to you that you are doing it in front of other&nbsp;people.</p>
<p>I also think opting in to new domains as part of a collaboration group would be useful.  Most sites either are, or are not, intended for a specific group.  In my own work <code>*.mozilla.org</code> is fine, as is <code>github.com</code> and <code>github.io</code>.  <code>reddit.com</code> probably isn&#8217;t; there might be <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1phhx1/we_are_mozilla_ask_us_anything/">exceptions</a>, so the &#8220;include once&#8221; and &#8220;include forever&#8221; distinction makes&nbsp;sense.</p>
<p>People are definitely going to make mistakes, but such is&nbsp;life.</p>
<h3>Another Way To Think About&nbsp;Tabs</h3>
<p>One of the first inspirations for thinking about collaborative browsing was the largely vaporous suggestion that collaboration should be part of Firefox <a href="https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/tab-groups-organize-tabs">Tab Groups/Panorama</a>. Whatever it is, I think <em>some</em> more sophisticated way to deal with a set of pages is necessary.  Now we&#8217;d be talking about our own pages, and other people&#8217;s pages.  And people may want to refer to pages and pieces of pages.  That may be the underlying metaphor behind Mode Changes: go to a new tab, fork a tab, review someone else&#8217;s tabs, etc. The linear list of tabs along the top has no room for anything so&nbsp;sophisticated.</p>
<p>And we&#8217;re not <em>just</em> talking about tabs, we&#8217;re talking about pages in a more sophisticated way.  Tabs are perhaps even a distraction, a particular bit of <span class="caps">UI</span> we&#8217;ve become familiar with.  We might want to watch someone else&#8217;s page action, &#8220;fork&#8221; their page (which could be as simple as loading a <span class="caps">URL</span> locally), tell someone else we&#8217;d like them to view our page, including exact scroll position and selection, or give someone a record of what we&#8217;ve&nbsp;done.</p>
<p>One thing the idea of &#8220;tabs&#8221; does give us is a two-level grouping: we have both <span class="caps">OS</span>-level windows, and for each window a list of tabs.  I fear this distinction is unclear to many people.  If it wasn&#8217;t, then we could imaging all collaboration groups existed in distinct windows (or on mobile devices, perhaps individual apps), and then we have a further breakdown of pages and tabs and other people&#8217;s tabs from there.  Using Pinned Tabs we might allow a bit of ubiquitous non-collaborative content across windows (Pin Harder!)  Or maybe we have another super-organizer on top of tabs but below windows.&nbsp;Tab-tabs.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s an aside, but over the Mozilla Summit there was a discussion about what Firefox can do to be better for web developers.  The <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/mozilla.dev.developer-tools/lzrrNCS4oKg">biggest takeaway</a> wasn&#8217;t the developer tools, it was tab management &#8212; nothing specific to developers, just to users who use the web a lot and want the most out of their&nbsp;tool.</p>
<h3>The Collaboration&nbsp;Tools</h3>
<p>So what do we actually show&nbsp;people?</p>
<p>Seeing each other&#8217;s mouse pointers is very compelling &#8212; it&#8217;s what people notice first, and seems very attractive.  I think this is more than just some sort of raw broad appeal.  <strong>The mouse cursor is like the body language of web interaction</strong>.  If the cursor is moving around, the person is very engaged with the page &#8212; they might not click on anything or do anything, but you see that movement.  The cursor often also indicates intentions, people move cursors to where they are <em>thinking</em> about doing&nbsp;something.</p>
<p>Text selection is another tool, more precise in many cases than a&nbsp;cursor.</p>
<p>Form focus and keyboard activity are also good to show.  We show them separately in TogetherJS, but probably they should be combined.  Form focus can often be unintentional.  We don&#8217;t care if a field gets autofocused, we only care if the focus represents the user&#8217;s intention to interact with that&nbsp;element.</p>
<p>Being able to show a snippet of a page is something I&#8217;ve found myself frequently wanting (something TogetherJS does not yet do).  This is somewhere between &#8220;go here now!&#8221; and &#8220;maybe look over here, m&#8217;kay?&#8221; &#8212; I really want someone to see some part of a page.  This might take the form of a screenshot that links to the original&nbsp;page.</p>
<p>When using screensharing there&#8217;s potential to rewind an interaction. This could answer the &#8220;huh, how did we get here?&#8221; question.  You can&#8217;t rewind normal apps, this is an example of someplace where screensharing (unlike simple peer-to-peer collaboration) enables some really neat&nbsp;features.</p>
<p>When in screensharing/demonstration mode you may want to &#8220;fork&#8221; the page.  This would open the page as normal, and then do what state initialization is possible in peer-to-peer mode &#8212; changing form field values, scrolling to the proper position, and doing any custom synchronization the application has&nbsp;defined.</p>
<h2>Feasibility</h2>
<p>Obviously making something cool is cool.  Fantasy tools work great! Can we actually make&nbsp;this?</p>
<p>Browser Mirror and TogetherJS together represent two distinct and fairly in-depth experiments.  I think a full tool needs to include both approaches.  We have not entirely demonstrated that these techniques can be robust on the wider web, or at least that when they fail they do so in a way that&#8217;s reasonably transparent and at least partially usable.  But I feel quite optimistic on this&nbsp;count.</p>
<p>For ambient awareness we may need some new <span class="caps">UI</span> metaphors and organizational tools.  Doing this well is non-trivial, and it must transparent, understandable, but also not too intrusive.  And it may involve new ways to organize browsing contexts, which means mucking about in fairly contentious parts of the&nbsp;browser.</p>
<p>Because this necessarily means multiple participants, we have to worry about version mismatches.  For screensharing scenarios we can to some degree rely on the source browser to bootstrap the viewing browser, thus absolutely ensuring consistent versions of client code.  But for many other parts of a system we run a bigger risk of conflicting or out of date&nbsp;clients.</p>
<p>With a <span class="caps">UI</span> and group interactions that need refinement and perhaps specialization for different kinds of groups, it may be infeasible to come up with a <span class="caps">UI</span> that is widely optimal.  The challenge here: can at least part of the <span class="caps">UI</span> be distributed and developed separately from the browser?  If so, version mismatch might also be&nbsp;mitigated.</p>
<p>Collaborative tools necessarily work in heterogeneous environments. If we demand Firefox (and to begin with, specifically Firefox <em>Nightly</em>) how many groups could we reasonably support?  Far too few, I think – requiring everyone in a group to switch to a single browser just to preview these capabilities is too unrealistic.  If we rely only on current cross-browser capabilities then we can&#8217;t do much beyond what TogetherJS already does.  Any attempt to standardize would be&nbsp;folly.</p>
<p>In some cases cross-browser isn&#8217;t hard at all.  For the <em>viewer</em> in a screenshare environment you might almost have to work to keep it from being cross-browser.  And viewing alone is useful functionality!  We don&#8217;t need parity across all browsers, we just need a functional and useful experience.  Extensions may also be a partial solution, though they could also require excessive effort for what may still be an inferior experience.  Also I don&#8217;t believe newer versions of Internet Explorer offer any extension&nbsp;mechanism.</p>
<p>Security looms as a risk in all of&nbsp;this.</p>
<h3>Intermediate&nbsp;Products</h3>
<p>I am distrustful of a final vision of this suite of tools.  What is really feasible to implement?  What is useful?  What is attractive? What is error-prone, or&nbsp;dangerous?</p>
<p>What usable tools can we produce along the&nbsp;way?</p>
<p>One is simply Browser-Mirror-style screen sharing, with no particular persistent sessions, view-only or almost-view-only, and explicit link-based&nbsp;invitations.</p>
<p>Another component is chat (text, audio, video) in the browser context. This is actually already happening under the name <a href="">Talkilla</a>.  In another sense this has also happened as part of the <a href="">Social <span class="caps">API</span></a>, allowing content to be more persistent in the browser, upon which you could build&nbsp;chat.</p>
<p>TogetherJS of course is another tool.  It live entirely in content, but it can incrementally lean on the browser to implement pieces. This would solve some current usability issues, like needing to reconnect audio chat whenever you&nbsp;navigate.</p>
<p>We could provide communication channels that content could take advantage of, while managing the communications through our in-browser presence&nbsp;system.</p>
<p>We could expose page information to the Social <span class="caps">API</span>, allowing collaboration tools to be built in this&nbsp;sidebar.</p>
<p>We could explore peer-to-peer authentication, for managing the identity of your peers.  Right now most authentication schemes use some server&nbsp;authority.</p>
<p>We could provide basic browsing information (URLs, and activity/attention) for ambient&nbsp;awareness.</p>
