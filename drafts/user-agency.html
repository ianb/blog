        <div class="entry-content"><p>Mozilla is above all other things a maker of a user&nbsp;agent.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s easy for us to forget that.  We talk about &#8220;the open web&#8221; a lot in Mozilla, far more than we talk about being a user agent.  But our effect on the open web is far less direct than our effect on this user agent that we&nbsp;create.</p>
<p>In part we&#8217;ve stepped back from engaging with the concept of user agent <strong>because</strong> of the open web concept.  We talk ourselves out of innovating because of web standards and accepted&nbsp;conventions.</p>
<p>The competitive landscape for browsers is perhaps a bit peculiar. There are basically four players: Apple, Microsoft, Google, and Mozilla.  Apple and Microsoft are not particularly progressive, they just want their stuff to work, reluctantly following along.  So mostly we pay attention to Google and Chrome; Google does at least <strong>care</strong> about the web.  But Google&#8217;s business is primarily tied to web <strong>sites</strong> – they are&nbsp;supply-siders.</p>
<p>Half the time people at Mozilla seem obsessed with opinions we project onto the web-as-it-is.  Privacy, user control, decentralization. Those are reasonable values, but they are values more meaningfully applied to the larger world.  We apply these values to Mozilla&#8217;s own operations not because the effects are particularly meaningful, but because we believe that we must set an&nbsp;example.</p>
<p>And yet still, we are a user agent.  That is, we are placed between, one sidek, the content and application providers, and on the other the user.  This arrangement, which is one of the essential aspects of the web, has been successful.  It is a platform in which users can confidently interact with nearly anyone, knowing that the user agent can offer considerable protection.  It could be argued that the browser has, through its implicit regulation, created a healthy market of interactive content, to the benefit of both provider and&nbsp;consumer.</p>
<p>The nature of this user agent is fairly fixed.  All the options work relatively similarly, most of the similarity through deliberate standardization effort.  Outwardly we all have bookmarks, tabs, <span class="caps">URL</span> bars, implicit search, and so&nbsp;on.</p>
<p>But is this all we can do?  A focus on the web platform makes it hard to see new potential.  If we do something different with our platform then we are messing with standards.  If we do something beyond standards then will anyone pay attention?  Who wants to develop just for Firefox users?  Adoption of novel Firefox platform features has been modest when they do occur, usually limited to hobbyist&nbsp;experiments.</p>
<p>These constraints are limited to the scopes we already expect, to this supply-side perspective, a web-developer-focused notion of success. When we extend the platform in new directions, and when we offer users new experiences, we can create something that might be viable even if it is&nbsp;Firefox-specific.</p>
<p>Our research has shown that a large number of users are polyamorous towards their browsers – they will frequently move between browsers because of a particular feature (or lack of a feature).  Maybe the per-browser cookie jar keeps people mobile as a form of profile switching, and so they retain habits of moving between browsers and a a readiness to be won over by one browser or another.  There&#8217;s room for competition, and it seems like there&#8217;s an audience for that&nbsp;competition.</p>
<p>In this landscape features that target users make sense, while features that target web developers (and web sites) don&#8217;t make&nbsp;sense.</p>
<p>When Firefox rose in prominence, it was in an environment where there were no real competitors.  Internet Explorer wasn&#8217;t doing anything, Microsoft wasn&#8217;t interested in this competition.  I think there still exists that open field, a place where no one wants to compete with Mozilla, but we won&#8217;t find it by looking at our&nbsp;competitors.</p>
<p>But mobile, but mobile, but always mobile!  The desktop is dying! This doesn&#8217;t make sense to me.  It feels like a game of misreading statistics.  Of unnecessarily aggregating products.  Are computers suddenly becoming less important?  Perhaps people have stopped doing work on a computer?  The world gets bigger, different parts at different paces, but the rise of one technology doesn&#8217;t itself make another technology less important.  Where do we want to be in five years, or ten years?  What is the path to that destination?  I can&#8217;t even start to answer that question.  Does the path lead through the desktop, or through mobile, through an operating&nbsp;system?</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know.  But the bet I&#8217;d like to make &#8212; not because I know it will win, but because I want it to win &#8212; is that the path forward is through user agency.  Through a user empowerment that doesn&#8217;t just <em>protect</em> users, but strengthens markets and creates new ones.  I want our path forward to be one where we empower users first, and developers come along.  I&#8217;m tired of those gatekeepers.  I want every user to be a power&nbsp;user.</p>
<p>[Games are perhaps a bad direction, because we want to enable people to cheat &#8212; we want to create the cheater&#8217;s browser, the user agent that always acts to your best&nbsp;benefit]</p>
<hr>
<p>Mozilla&#8217;s job is making Firefox.  This is what we are paid for.  We are paid in cash mostly by Google, but really our money comes from the presence of our user base.  And our user base exists because of the quality of the product that is &#8220;Firefox&#8221;.  We don&#8217;t have our users because of our mission.  We <strong>want</strong> to have users because of our mission, we keep telling ourselves that it&#8217;s because of our mission, <strong>but it is not</strong>.  It&#8217;s the product.  The mission is the wages we extract from our users.  Mozillians want the mission, users want the product, and we leverage our users for the mission, we use our mission to motivate ourselves and attract developers and for Mozillians to tell ourselves that there is a purpose.  Mind you, I like the mission, and it does buy us something, but we aren&#8217;t the <span class="caps">EFF</span>.</p>
<p>Pursuit of continued success <strong>is</strong> our&nbsp;job.</p></div>
