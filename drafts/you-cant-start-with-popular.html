        <div class="entry-content"><p>Mozilla&#8217;s undergoing a lot of changes in the last few years.  A huge part of this is related to the question of choosing <em>why</em> Mozilla does what it&nbsp;does.</p>
<p>For a while I would go around asking people at Mozilla how they would tell someone else <em>why should you use Firefox?</em>  It&#8217;s a frustratingly hard question for us to answer, and answers often rested on the values of Mozilla&#8230; and sadly not how those values were embodied in Firefox itself.  But there was a subtly different kind of answer that I also got: people should use Firefox because its popularity is what gives Mozilla the influence to protect the web.  In some sense this is a more honest answer, but it also says nothing about why <em>you</em> should use Firefox.  And so it went for Mozilla and&nbsp;Firefox&#8230;</p>
<p>Things are changing in Mozilla!  The Firefox Group no longer accepts these kinds of answers.  But that still doesn&#8217;t actually answer the question: <em>why should you use Firefox?</em>  There is a tension here, unresolved&nbsp;questions.</p>
<p>In an effort to resolve these questions we are trying very hard to focus our planning on user value.  This is different from focusing on, say, open standards, privacy-for-privacy, or acting as an example of good corporate behavior.  Mozilla <em>is</em> a mission-led organization, it does have values that drive our action, but we&#8217;re using that more as a filter and less as a driver of our activity.  I think this is good: when we were more mission-focused instead of product-focused it made it all too easy for each person to project personal goals onto the organization, with disappointment for everyone involved (myself&nbsp;included).</p>
<p>But user value, the pursuit of popularity&#8230; I&#8217;m skeptical of this too.  Sure, it would be awesome to have a breakout hit&#8230; as though we can just will ourselves to achieve this.  But we must instead prepare ourselves – expect as an inevitability – that everything we do will be met with disinterest.  We&#8217;re never going to simply achieve success.  And what then?  Do we pivot?  Do we flail?  Do we retreat?  Do we figure out what it is we understand how to do, then come up with reasoning that supports a clear&nbsp;path?</p>
<p>So I would assert that we must not start with user value and we must not simply pursue popularity.  We have to decide what Mozilla and Firefox organizations desperately <em>want</em> to be popular.  Not everything that we want may be achievable, but we still have to start with desire, because it&#8217;s desire that will allow us to go through the challenging and sometimes painful process to actually achieve success, to keep working when it&#8217;s not going well and none of it feels&nbsp;rewarding.</p>
<p><a href="">Context Graph</a> hints at an idea.  But it&#8217;s fragile, incomplete; if someone said &#8220;eh, let&#8217;s not do that&#8221; all efforts would immediately scatter to the&nbsp;wind.  </p>
<p>It&#8217;s not Mozilla&#8217;s goal, but I will state <em>my</em> goal with <a href="">Pageshot</a>.  It is not to be useful, it&#8217;s not just jamming on the popularity of screenshots.  In the three-way struggle for power between site owner, user agent, and user, I want to shift power to the user (not even to the user agent, whose role we have kept limited in PageShot).  And even though PageShot has kept getting pushed aside for other priorities, even though it has no sponsor, even though I can see many dragons up ahead, we keep&nbsp;going.</p>
<p>Should our products tell a story?  Do you want to get on board, see where this is going?  Not everyone thinks a user agent should tell a story.  Open standards work against this, towards commodification (and towards site owner dominance, given the dynamics of these bodies).  Google doesn&#8217;t want the user agent to tell a story, except maybe a story of competence and accuracy, the cold depersonalized politics and aesthetic Google brings to the web and embodied in so many of their products.  Mozilla has learned far too much from Google.  Can Firefox have a voice?  This is a question for the institution of Mozilla, and since institutions aren&#8217;t people the only way we&#8217;ll get an answer is if it does or does not express a voice in its&nbsp;product.</p></div>
