        <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve been thinking about surveillance, <span class="caps">PRISM</span>, the <span class="caps">NSA</span>, a lot recently. As perhaps we all have.  And I&#8217;ve had a hard time dissecting my own feelings on the matter, identifying exactly what bothers me and what&nbsp;doesn&#8217;t.</p>
<p>On the one hand, I&#8217;m actually open to the idea of surveillance.  How much?  I&#8217;m not sure.  Conducted in what matter?  I&#8217;m not sure.  I don&#8217;t know what it should look like, or if it should exist at&nbsp;all.</p>
<p>The concrete outcomes of surveillance aren&#8217;t clear at all.  A liberal sort of person in the past might have thought &#8220;we can&#8217;t have surveillance cameras in inconspicuace places, why a negro might appear to look at a white woman in a lustful manner, such that a malicious person with access to the archives could frame any negro man and get him lynched.&#8221;  But unless you indulge in incredibly hyperbole (which a lot of the people in this discussion do) that wasn&#8217;t the outcome. Openness breeds tolerance and&nbsp;liberalism.</p>
<p>So we don&#8217;t know what to expect out of changes to surveillance.  I for instance think that a surveilled group could be better understood by law enforcement groups, and less likely to have negative stereotypes projected onto them.  I don&#8217;t have any reason to trust that the police have accurate notions of the cultures and customs of radical groups, so I think there should be a real concern that persecution can proceed from ignorance.  But neither group wants to believe this &#8212; the police want to believe they are confronting dangerous people, the radicals want to believe they are dangerous to <em>someone</em> enough to expect reprisals, and find conspiratorial explanations of persecution more comforting than the idea it was just a big&nbsp;mistake.</p>
<p>But I don&#8217;t know.  I&#8217;m pretty sure other people don&#8217;t know either. How do I know?  Ask for the evidence.  Not <em>journalistic evidence</em> but <em>real evidence</em>, and the two aren&#8217;t very close.  The evidence you must as for is what evidence there is that conclusions follow from the provided anecdotes.  If you ask &#8220;how does the <span class="caps">FBI</span> receive political signalling that would make it persecute certain political groups?&#8221; and there&#8217;s too much handwaving, too many implausible suppositions without enough consideration of less conspiratorial causes.  That doesn&#8217;t make it impossible that these critiques are <em>right</em>, but it does make it impossible to be certain of outcomes &#8212; the best we&#8217;re dealing with is political science on the level of alchemy, it is not the stuff of engineering, of predictable&nbsp;results.</p>
<p>What we do have is an iterative political process where we can watch policy effects unfold and adapt the law to stear that effect.  I don&#8217;t want to get in a truistic gung-ho admiration of democracy, but it does have a number of successes it can point to, some that even the most fervent critic would have to acknoledge so long as they were honest. And you don&#8217;t have to believe that the wisdom of democracy comes from the wisdom of the masses to at least see that there is a process of reflection and advocacy and choices spread over a wide set of perspectives that make up the law &#8212; even if politics is an insider game, that still includes a far greater set of perspectives than a dictatorship.  And even if the effect is not always as direct as we&#8217;d like, the wider opinions of society filter their way into these&nbsp;discussions.</p>
<p>But this is all contingent on critical and informed decision making, and when programs are secret that does not&nbsp;happen.</p></div>
