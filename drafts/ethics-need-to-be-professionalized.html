        <div class="entry-content"><p>When I was a younger developer I was placed in situations where I felt pressured into unethical&nbsp;practices.</p>
<p>Many of the unethical practices from that time are now much better. A small case might be &#8220;is it acceptable to put plaintext passwords in a database if that saves development time?&#8221; That sounds like a security issue, but like many security issues it immediately turns into an ethical issue. The client who is paying to me isn&#8217;t going to be hurt if those passwords leak, instead they are putting other people at risk, and a hidden risk at&nbsp;that.</p>
<p>On the kind of small, shoestring projects I worked on at the time, I might well be the only person to advocate for the right thing. I usually won these arguments because I was pretty good at explaining myself – or at least explaining the other person into submission – and because I was and still am terribly stubborn when I think I&#8217;m right. (Narrator: he is not always right.) But if plaintext passwords are relatively simple, and don&#8217;t ultimately require any product compromises, there were other issues that are not so simple and where I did not stand up for the ethical thing, or even recognize it at the time. (In retrospect every aspect of the dating site I worked for was a fraud, and I knew at the time that it wasn&#8217;t right to help the scalper automate buying&nbsp;tickets.)</p>
<p>It&#8217;s easier now that I&#8217;m older, but there will always be young people trying to hustle up some job, or insecure about their skills, or customers who specifically shop around for pliable engineers. Individually standing up for ethical behavior isn&#8217;t scalable and isn&#8217;t broad&nbsp;enough.</p>
<p>Security practice has something to teach us here. There was a time when even basic security practices felt like an ethical quandary. Having to be ethically engaged to do basic parts of your work is not positive! It means difficult conversations, it means sometimes losing the argument, it means the person who is ethically engaged probably underperforms the person who just does what they are&nbsp;told.</p>
<p>Security culture and best practices have moved a lot of questions out of the realm of ethics and into professionalism and acceptable standard practice. Let&#8217;s do more of that! Having <em>ethical concerns</em> is a position of weakness, it puts those questions on the sidelines, it makes ethical behavior a critique instead of a&nbsp;foundation.</p>
<p>The result has to be done piece-by-piece, taking current areas of &#8220;ethical concern&#8221; and giving each area a name, coming to some broad consensus on standard practice, documenting that, aggressively defining it as professional and excluding unethical practice as unprofessional, and spreading it with a confidence that <em>this is just what professional behavior looks like</em>. The consensus probably won&#8217;t be as aggressively ethical as many people would like (myself included), but I&#8217;m pretty sure it will be better than a lot of <em>current</em>&nbsp;practice.</p>
<p>Some&nbsp;areas:</p>
<ol>
<li>Creating demographically balanced data sets for training&nbsp;models</li>
<li>Appropriate handling of user&nbsp;data</li>
<li>Acceptable practices for soliciting reviews&nbsp;4.</li>
