        <div class="entry-content"><p>Mozilla is at a turning point. We’ve <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2020/01/15/readying-for-the-future-at-mozilla/">just laid off a bunch of people</a>. This feels sad and disappointing. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usage_share_of_web_browsers#/media/File:StatCounter-browser-ww-monthly-200901-201905.png">Firefox’s marketshare</a> is all disappointment, and the many real technical improvements we’ve made to Firefox can’t seem to turn it around. And yet Mozilla seems as necessary as ever, if not&nbsp;more.</p>
<p>The sense of loss in the layoffs could turn into a sense of doom, or a need to get out, or resentment, or questioning of means. I would rather think of it in terms of resolve: this is a signal that we can’t just keep fighting the same battles. On a personal level we’re not suffering, Mozilla treats its employees well, and I am confident that the people leaving – and myself when that time comes – will do well. It <em>will</em> be stressful, and leaving against your will is powerfully disempowering. It seems fair that those of us still here also take on a sense of (productive)&nbsp;stress.</p>
<p>The question we have is: what should Mozilla do? As described in the announcement of layoffs, we are making sacrifices to leave room for new opportunities. But any opportunities available are only the ones we find for&nbsp;ourselves.</p>
<p>This is where I will offer my opinion on what product directions Mozilla should&nbsp;take:</p>
<h1>User Agents as both tactic and&nbsp;strategy</h1>
<p>A user agent is a program that belongs to the user and acts on behalf of the user. Specifically it interacts with third-party services and&nbsp;software.</p>
<p>User agents are fairly uncommon. Browsers of course. Email clients. There used to be instant messaging clients, but these are mostly gone. Mobile <span class="caps">OS</span>’s fill many roles of a user&nbsp;agent.</p>
<p>An <em>independent</em> user agent is particularly important. You might consider the Facebook app to be a user agent that allows the user to interact with the Facebook service, but there’s no real boundaries: the client, the backend, the site, the social network, the business that funds it, are all one big thing. The <a href="http://scripting.com/davenet/2001/04/30/strategyTax.html">strategy tax rate</a> is very high in a system like Facebook. The user cannot separately choose their agent and their service, which is antithetical to an&nbsp;“agent”.</p>
<p>Because a user agent acts on behalf of the user, it should aspire to interpret the person’s <em>intentions</em>.</p>
<p>Independent user agents are naturally subversive. For instance, ad blockers subvert the monetization of the web, but not in the service of any alternative: they add directed instability (as opposed to directionless instability), and we don’t know how the system will ultimately react. Right now technology (and maybe capitalism generally) is filled with tensions, but the tensions are externalized away from the commercial institutions and onto the public. An independent user agent does not accept that&nbsp;compromise.</p>
<h1>Adversarial&nbsp;Interoperability</h1>
<p><a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2019/10/adversarial-interoperability">Adversarial interoperability</a> describes making things interoperable despite the wishes of hopeful&nbsp;monopolists.</p>
<p>As described, some <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2019/06/adversarial-interoperability-reviving-elegant-weapon-more-civilized-age-slay">classic examples</a> of adversarial interoperability are the various applications that learned to read Word documents, Samba reimplementing the <span class="caps">SMB</span> protocol, and web&nbsp;crawlers.</p>
<p>Sometimes this stuff was dangerous and unwanted. There was a time when it was common for applications to ask for your login credentials to Gmail so they could comb through your email, purportedly only to collect contacts, but who really knows? The answer to this has been APIs, a kind of cooperative interoperability, but whose bounds are limited by both parties’ incentives and ability to coexist in&nbsp;peace.</p>
<p>I believe a user agent can be an important component in both reforming the dangerous old ways and unwinding the silos of today. I wouldn’t want to give some new social network access to my entire email interface and identity, but if I can trust a responsible user agent I believe it’s possible to create a user agent that can mediate that kind of data transfer safely and responsibly confirm intent. By placing a person at the center, and by creating a user agent that aligns itself <em>only</em> with that person, we can create something with unique technical capabilities – freed from the complicated business relationships of rivals – and with the moral standing to make humane choices that may not align with corporate&nbsp;goals.</p>
<h1>What might the next user agents look&nbsp;like?</h1>
<p>Importantly the next set of user agents need not and should not wait for the world to catch up. From day one a new user agent should work with the world we have right&nbsp;now.</p>
<p>Creating something that works with an uncaring and possibly hostile world is hard. We’ve built browsers on specifications and negotiations, the careful compromise between users and site owners and implementors. I don’t think we’ll have that luxury for this set of user agents, even if the relationship is ultimately the right thing for the entire&nbsp;market.</p>
<p>Some examples that come to&nbsp;mind:</p>
<ul>
<li>A multi-protocol messaging&nbsp;system</li>
<li>A promotional mail aggregator/forwarding&nbsp;system</li>
<li>Account management: list accounts you have, offer to delete fallow accounts, etc. (Features <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/lockwise/">Lockwise</a> may&nbsp;grow.)</li>
<li>Tools to allow you to navigate topics regardless of linking; e.g., if I see a questionable article, can I find trusted articles on the same&nbsp;subject?</li>
<li>Ways to navigate multiple video streaming&nbsp;services</li>
<li>Tools to move data between personalized or authenticated&nbsp;services</li>
<li>Collective aggregation and analysis of personalized advertising (sometimes users <em>want</em> to make data public that a service provider would rather keep&nbsp;private)</li>
<li>Firewalls and VPNs and other tools that can mediate at the network&nbsp;level</li>
<li>Tools to interpret difficult or opaque documents, such as terms of service&nbsp;agreements.</li>
<li>Tools to navigate customer service relationships. Put a bot at both ends of the&nbsp;chat!</li>
<li>Tools to publish, aggregate, and analyze bills. Start with cable and internet&nbsp;service.</li>
<li>Apply third-party indexes, reviews, and commentary to other&nbsp;services.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some of these are examples of re-establishing a latent client/service relationship. Others try to pull out structured data where it might otherwise be hard to find and use. Some involve creating collective knowledge, and/or encoding knowledge into the&nbsp;tool.</p>
<p>I think encoding knowledge in our tools is interesting, though relatively untested. Armchair punditry often declares: people just need to start acting smarter! Do your own research! But if positive change requires everyone to suddenly become smarter, more knowledgeable, wise in the ways of every corner of our vast economy and ecology, then that change cannot happen: if a recipe for change is a recipe where everyone becomes something they are not, then it is no recipe. But a trusted agent can be knowledgeable on your behalf, change can happen through reputation and aspiration applied voluntarily to individual’s&nbsp;actions.</p>
<p>Agents that know things on your behalf might sound patronizing and dictatorial, but it’s not far from how things work already. Do we teach everyone how to read domains carefully so they know the difference between <code>paypal.com</code> and <code>paypal.com.service.biz</code>? Or do we put up a warning when someone tries to open the second&nbsp;link?</p>
<h2>Keep the web at the center of&nbsp;Mozilla</h2>
<p>I believe Mozilla should still go long on the&nbsp;web.</p>
<p>I’ve long felt a pervasive futurist-pessimism about the web, and yet the web still dominates. The web is the source of knowledge, the one common denominator of interface, and by percentages other things grow faster, but in mass the web still grows fastest of all. Sure the web struggles in places, but it’s the water we all swim&nbsp;in.</p>
<p>The web is also so damn malleable. If we’re willing to get our hands dirty then just about everything we need to mediate, separate, aggregate, everything we need to disrupt or enhance for users is in the web somewhere. And Mozilla has the&nbsp;skills.</p>
<h2>My own&nbsp;work</h2>
<p>A while back I joined the Voice Products team in <a href="https://research.mozilla.org/">Emerging Technologies</a>. I’ve been meaning to write about it, but now I’ll have to write about it&nbsp;here.</p>
<p>The team’s definition (<em>voice</em>) made me a bit reluctant at first. I don’t like interface-driven divides. I wasn’t part of the clicky products team previously, nor would I call mobile a touchy browser, and “voice” feels like it should be a secondary attribute. But teams need a name, and the team is open minded, so Voice is also a fine&nbsp;name.</p>
<p>Due to technological advancements voice interfaces are feasible where previously they were not, so there is some reason to think opportunities are newly available. But potential opportunities are only as good as the actual opportunities you&nbsp;find.</p>
<p>What excites me particularly about voice is how directly it engages with intention. Every visual and click interface is a kind of multiple-choice-question. There are still a lot of choices! But you can’t click on something that’s not on the screen. And it’s not just the finite set of options, but how those options are composed: user intention is performed through a set of interactions. With your voice you can say anything. You can talk about things that don’t exist yet, things in the past that have paged away, you can combine thoughts and actions, nouns and verbs in all kinds of&nbsp;ways.</p>
<p>Of course you can’t <em>actually</em> do many of those things right now. But what a fun thing to try to do! There’s open space to explore. And all of it is engaged tightly with intention: unbounded by multiple choice interfaces we can imagine a person saying what they really want to do instead of manually executing on a recipe of actions to achieve an&nbsp;intention.</p>
<p>And because you can talk about things you can’t see, you can express intents that aren’t bound by services. Each tab in a browser is its own world, and cross-tab/cross-site/cross-service interactions require the clipboard and tab switching and a lot of personal mental&nbsp;accounting.</p>
<p>We’re starting out <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/firefox-voice">with a voice assistant in the browser</a>. The ceiling on this particular packaging of voice functionality is probably low; there are limited use cases for talking to your computer. But I am hoping we can retain a sense of imagination to see how this is the scaffolding for much&nbsp;more.</p>
<p>Right now we cannot actually <em>do</em> most of the things you’d want to tell your browser to do. We’re adding stuff, but it takes time, it’s a very small team, and we’re very much trying to understand what exactly it is we (and users) are trying to accomplish. By attaching our tool to a high-functioning and familiar web browser we will never abandon a user, because they can always just go back to normal user. As we get get better I hope the alternate input methods become less and less necessary. Speech output could in turn makes the visual output less&nbsp;necessary.</p>
<p>If you don’t need to see the browser, if we can mediate and abbreviate the necessary output, if we can understand the commands you give, I can see how these same approaches can be applied to mobile or a voice assistant or a <span class="caps">TV</span> or whatever&nbsp;else.</p>
<p>If the tool can confidently execute even more (or at least know its own limits) then you can take those same actions that a person speaks and start to do them on behalf of the user even when they aren’t present, creating an autonomous&nbsp;agent.</p>
<p>If all this is built on the web, and even built on browsers, at each stage you can fail back to another familiar interface, or provide auditable interactions like a set of screenshots that show how the voice assistant tried to perform an interaction. At no point does it have to be perfect, just better and&nbsp;better.</p>
<p>There’s so many unknowns here, and hard and very much unsolved problems, that we can’t know if it’s possible. This is one possible user agent among many, and Mozilla should try a bunch. But I’m optimistic. <em>And</em> pessimistic: actually accomplishing this will require some faith, some stubbornness, some humility, some ingenuity, and definitely a lot of community. That’s a lot of things that have to come together in order to achieve success. For this experiment, <strong>or any other product experiment Mozilla will try</strong>, we need to figure out how to be a bit more&nbsp;brave.</p></div>
