        <div class="entry-content"><p>I have recently joined a new team and group at Mozilla, in Emerging Technologies, Voice Interfaces, and specifically the project creating a browser-based voice&nbsp;assistant.</p>
<p>Being back in the world of prototyping new products and user experiences is comfortable and enjoyable. It reaffirms my own understanding that I am not a good <span class="caps">SRE</span>. I technically have all the qualifications to be an <span class="caps">SRE</span>, which is why in the midst of organizational change I sometimes end up unintentionally in those kinds of roles. But it&#8217;s no good for anyone. I sometimes feel guilty about this, but I&#8217;m trying to get over this. No one would accidentally assign me to a visual design role, and I would not reluctantly say &#8220;sure, I can do that.&#8221; But if it&#8217;s some kind of <em>programming</em> then I can&#8217;t help&nbsp;myself.</p>
<p>But now I feel like I&#8217;m back in my wheelhouse. Even though I&#8217;m inheriting a project, it was fairly small, within the scope of being completely refactored. I realize I do well when I can keep an entire project in my head, which is a combination of project scope, self-determined architecture, and me investing the time to keep it under control. Nothing about this scales, but that&#8217;s why I like early projects. An early project also makes it <em>worth it</em> for me to keep everything in my head, because that gives me the confidence to embrace substantial change and revision as we discover what the project should&nbsp;be.</p>
<p>The specific project I am working on is a voice assistant for the browser. I want to explain why I&#8217;m excited about it, but I feel like I have to preface this by acknowledging that my ambitions for the project may never come to pass. I don&#8217;t want you, reader, to confuse this for a project roadmap. This is more like a time capsule I&#8217;m creating for myself, that I can compare against what we really&nbsp;make.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a few different ways to think about voice&nbsp;interfaces:</p>
<ol>
<li>Supportive technology for people or situations where other inputs and interfaces don&#8217;t&nbsp;work</li>
<li>A way to create more ambient or subtle interfaces, without visual impositions, and without a need for immediate physical&nbsp;presence</li>
<li>A way to interace using natural language instead of defined interfaces with visual feedback establishing the exact options&nbsp;available</li>
</ol>
<p>As an example of (1) I search for things on my phone using voice because it&#8217;s annoying to type some queries. My daughter can use Alexa to play music even though she is not literate. In this area the focus is on&nbsp;algorithms.</p>
<p>A lot of futurism focuses on (3), and it&#8217;s kind of the fantasy of ubiquitous household technology. Home voice assistants focus a lot on this, and there&#8217;s a lot of focus on&nbsp;hardware.</p>
<p>(3) is what I get excited about. I use voice to create reminders on my phone for this reason, it&#8217;s the ability to express something in a sentence that would otherwise require a series of navigations, date inputs, typing input, and perhaps mental&nbsp;calculations.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s been experiments in natural-language input in the past, such as <a href="">Ubiquity</a>. Voice makes that natural language input easier, sloppier, more casual, and deliberately orthogonal to other clicky or typy interfaces. There&#8217;s obviously upsides and downsides to these features. But hopefully voice interfaces are a good reason to try&nbsp;again.</p>
<p>In turn there&#8217;s two approaches to voice&nbsp;interfaces:</p>
<ol>
<li>Allow individual applications to define their own voice interaces. Make sure it&#8217;s easy for them to get the input they want. Potentially create a hub that will direct voice input to the appropriate application, as a kind of federated&nbsp;approach.</li>
<li>Voice is used to control the singular user agent, that interprets and executes the command. In this model applications at most provide semantically-defined verbs, and the user agent decides how to make use of&nbsp;them.</li>
</ol>
<p>Traditionally Mozilla has chosen approach (1), often with new Web APIs or specifications. And we may well do so for voice, but in <em>this</em> project we are exploring (2): the user agent collecting and interpreting voice input, and then executing the command as it sees fit, potentially across services, and without the service or application opting-in to&nbsp;anything.</p>
<p>Creating a voice web user agent is both easier and harder than the first approach. It&#8217;s harder because interpreting and acting on arbitrary commands, across the extensive diversity of the web, is hard! It&#8217;s easier because having done it, the tool actually does something; while having defined a specification, nothing in the world will have changed until and unless people make use of that&nbsp;specification.</p>
<p>Making a voice-based web user agent is, of course, much more work than our little team can possibly do. So we also need a great deal of scaffolding. For this project, desktop Firefox is that scaffolding. The number of things this provides to us is hard to enumerate: installation systems, permissions, account systems, multitasking, interface surface area, and a completely capable fallback to the normal mouse-and-keyboard interface. We&#8217;ll be leaning on this very, very heavily for the foreseeable&nbsp;future.</p>
<p>Unfortunately for all its benefits, the ceiling is pretty low on what we can achieve in the context of desktop Firefox. People don&#8217;t <em>want</em> to talk to their desktop computers. There&#8217;s a good chance you have Siri or Cortana available to you right now. Do you use them? I don&#8217;t. Instead there&#8217;s this rich, complete, familiar, well-optimized mouse-and-keyboard interface, and I&#8217;m at my computer because for whatever I&#8217;m doing that&#8217;s a good&nbsp;interface.</p>
<p>This sounds pessimistic, and it is, but I don&#8217;t want us to create unreasonable expectations. We&#8217;re not going to get a lot of people using this tool, at least not in this form factor. If we&#8217;re successful, it will be by creating something useful that has lessons and approaches we can translate elsewhere. I have some ideas where that &#8220;elsewhere&#8221; can be, but for now there&#8217;s lots of work and risk in just making something&nbsp;useful.</p>
<p>So what would make this&nbsp;useful?</p>
<p>Visual interfaces involve lots of categorization and narrowing focus: you get things done by navigation, reading categories, parsing visual groupings, until you find a&nbsp;control.</p>
<p>Voice controls just wait for you to say something, then try to make sense of it. There&#8217;s no enforced focus or scope, except of course the assistant&#8217;s dense&nbsp;incomprehension.</p>
<p>A good assistant will, I think, support commands across services, and without this focus-switch-refocus-act&nbsp;behavior.</p></div>
