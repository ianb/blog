        <div class="entry-content"><p>Some things are best learned informally through practice. Other things are really hard to learn that&nbsp;way.</p>
<p>You don&#8217;t have to go through a computer science degree to learn things formally. But you do need to sit down, find some directed learning material, and work your way through to understand these&nbsp;things.</p>
<p>Most of my own learning has been informal, and I think that&#8217;s true for most experienced software engineers. While I went through formal <span class="caps">CS</span> education, I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s what made me a &#8220;good programmer&#8221;. I am happy to see the rise of Bootcamps, and generally impressed with their outcomes, as they seem to push people into the practice of programming as quickly as possible. But some things don&#8217;t lend themselves to intuition or incremental&nbsp;learning.</p>
<h2>Parsing and&nbsp;compilers</h2>
<p>I played around with language implementation when I was pretty young, doing it entirely by guessing. This did not work&nbsp;well.</p>
<p>When I took a programming language course using <a href="">recursive decent parsing</a> it was a revelation. Things that seemed super hard suddenly became&nbsp;easy!</p>
<p>To this day I still am drawn to hand-written recursive decent parsers, like that first course I took. This is a sign that maybe I need <em>more</em> formal learning to expand my comfort zone. Specifically bottom-up parsing feels like it requires another round of formal&nbsp;learning.</p>
<p>The <a href="">build yourself an interpreter</a> series seems like an excellent introduction&nbsp;here.</p>
<h2>Neural&nbsp;nets</h2>
<p>Being part of this decade&#8217;s zeitgeist, this is relatively new to me too. Of course people talk about &#8220;deep learning&#8221; and &#8220;machine learning&#8221;, but those are categories. Neural nets are a specific technique, amenable to concrete&nbsp;learning.</p>
<p>Honestly while I&#8217;ve taken course material, I&#8217;m pretty sure I need to go deeper to get the understanding I need. When I took an online course a couple years ago I had a hard time finding good tutorials where you make a neural net from scratch, but now there are quite a few of&nbsp;these.</p>
<p>Some of the math and statistics here seem a bit distracting. People talk about &#8220;probabilities&#8221; but usually it&#8217;s all scores and rankings. Putting something on a scale of 0.0-1.0 doesn&#8217;t make it a probability! Especially when you literally pulled a normalization function out of your ass to get the number on that&nbsp;scale.</p>
<p>Data manipulation, feature selection, etc., seem amenable to informal, intuitive, and incremental learning. These areas are essential to actually making something that works, but I think they come from&nbsp;practice.</p>
<h1>Things best learned&nbsp;informally</h1>
<p>For all this, there&#8217;s a bunch of things I think you have to learn with practice and&nbsp;projects:</p>
<ul>
<li>Debugging</li>
<li>Code&nbsp;organization</li>
<li>Creating a mental model of runtime&nbsp;behavior</li>
<li>Therefore, most&nbsp;concurrency</li>
<li>Data structures, and choosing the right&nbsp;one</li>
<li>Testing</li>
<li>Error&nbsp;resilience</li>
</ul>
<p>With these there often isn&#8217;t a gestalt moment, a single idea that clarifies things. Instead you have construct and assimilate new mental models. You might progress from a naive but effective approach to a much more mature approach, and you have to recognize the opportunities to change how you work&#8230; but you have to start&nbsp;somewhere.</p>
<p>I think practice is necessary for these because this kind of mental reforming requires quite a bit of personal effort, you have to literally mentally struggle. I don&#8217;t think classes are a great way of achieving this. You might not be asked to struggle with the right thing. Often you aren&#8217;t really asked to struggle&#8230; if something is a struggle, there is no guarantee you achieve the goal, or even that having achieved an external goal that you&#8217;ve therefore made the internal changes to your mental model that supported that. Projects don&#8217;t really care what&#8217;s easy for you, what&#8217;s fair, what is reasonable, and as a result they can ask more of you, and ask it over an extended period of&nbsp;time.</p></div>
