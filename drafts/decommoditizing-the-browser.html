<p>Note: I am a Mozilla employee.  Nothing here represents Mozilla&#8217;s opinion, though I wish it&nbsp;did.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Andreas Gal, former Mozilla <span class="caps">CTO</span>, recently wrote an article: <a href="https://andreasgal.com/2017/05/25/chrome-won/">Chrome Won</a>. Andreas was key to the FirefoxOS effort, which also was part of several years of Mozilla losing focus on the desktop Firefox product.  We&#8217;ve <a href="https://medium.com/the-official-unofficial-firefox-blog/browse-against-the-machine-e793c0fee917">refocused</a>, and yet I&#8217;m unsure if the loss of focus or the regain of focus affects the&nbsp;trends:</p>
<p>[!insert&nbsp;image]</p>
<p>And&nbsp;why?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As Eric describes in his article, a lot of amazing technical work has gone into Firefox for Desktop the last years. The Desktop-focused teams were expanded, and mobile-focused efforts curtailed. Firefox Desktop today is technically competitive with Chrome Desktop in many areas, and even better than Chrome in some. Unfortunately, looking at the graphs, none of this has had any effect on market trends. Browsers are a commodity product. They all pretty much look the same and feel the same. All browsers work pretty well, and being slightly faster or using slightly less memory is unlikely to sway&nbsp;users.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Just like Firefox had an opportunity because <span class="caps">IE</span> was left fallow, Chrome had an opportunity because Firefox gave Chrome the opportunity to be faster and more reliable. Chrome is not going to return the favor, it&#8217;s not going to lose people&#8217;s trust, and so Firefox will not get another opportunity to win by making a better commodity. In the current browser market you can lose by making mistakes, but doing things right just maintains the status&nbsp;quo.</p>
<p><em>And yet</em> I strongly disagree with&nbsp;Andreas:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I started Firefox <span class="caps">OS</span> in 2011 because already back then I was convinced that desktops and browsers were dead. Not immediately–here we are 6 years later and both are still around–but both are legacy technologies that are not particularly influential going forward. I don’t think there will be a new browser war where Firefox or some other competitor re-captures market share from Chrome. It’s like launching a new and improved horse in the year 2017. We all drive cars now. Some people still use horses, and there is value to horses, but technology has moved on when it comes to&nbsp;transportation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Millions of hours are spent in desktop browsers every day.</strong> There is work to be done, and it is worth doing. How can this be our terminal condition? It is hubris to claim that this is the best that can be&nbsp;done&#8230;</p>
<h2>The danger of&nbsp;values</h2>
<p>At Mozilla we talk a lot about our values.  How we value privacy, how we value user sovereignty, and so&nbsp;on.</p>
<p>This is a dangerous story we tell ourselves: that Mozilla&#8217;s vision of itself is itself a feature of our&nbsp;products.</p>
<h2>Featuritis</h2>
<p>Everyone seems afraid of features, and Mozilla is no&nbsp;exception.</p>
<p>In part this is simply because the market is stable. People get what they want out of their browsers, they are familiar with the features, they&#8217;ve found ways to make the features work for their purposes. Firefox users are probably happy with Firefox acting the way it acts, because that&#8217;s why they use&nbsp;it.</p>
<p>It is <em>hard</em> to introduce a change in functionality that is useful. But lots of things are <em>hard</em>.</p>
<p>As a user it is hard to trust changes in functionality. If I see something new, is really intended for me? Will it stay around? Would it be worth it for me to change a functional workflow I already&nbsp;have?</p>
<p>Answer those questions is itself yet another product design goal. So be it! But I also think it is a problem of the commodity browser itself: between the Firefox user and Mozilla we have no shared understanding of <em>why</em> the person using Firefox wants to do <em>anything</em>. We offer a neutral window to the&nbsp;web.</p>
<p>Mozilla has found that it is common for people to use multiple browsers. People seem to categorize their behavior into browsers – one browser for work, another for home, or another for watching movies, another for privacy, or another for additional security. But which browser a person&nbsp;chooses</p></div>
