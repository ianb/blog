        <div class="entry-content"><p>In <a href="http://hapgood.us/2015/07/21/beyond-conversation/">Beyond Conversation</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/holden">Mike Caulfield</a> revisits <em>As We May Think</em> and alludes to Douglas Engelbart&#8217;s ideas about hypertext as a more personal&nbsp;experience.</p>
<p>http://hapgood.us/2015/07/22/follow-up-reader-as-link-author/&nbsp;http://luke.opperman.net/blog/2015/07/annotation-perspective/</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a kind of critique of the web, but I think this is unnecessary; the web is <em>very close</em> to this model, and I believe much of what is missing is not so much a flaw in the medium as it is missing tools for working with the&nbsp;medium.</p>
<p>Some of these features, cut slightly&nbsp;short:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>You have a library of items.</strong> You own them, they are in your memex. You don’t link documents you have to documents you don’t, because that would be&nbsp;silly.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="caps">OK</span> – this is not that easy.  In so far as it is a global and universally accessible library, we have <a href="https://archive.org/web/">ways of keeping content around</a>.  If the content is personal then it is much more challenging.  Typically people email themselves stuff they want to hold on to.  It&#8217;s&nbsp;primitive.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Each memex library contains your original materials and the materials of others.</strong> There’s no read-only version of the memex, because that would be&nbsp;silly.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The web is great at this!  Just post something&nbsp;somewhere.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Links are associative.</strong> This is a huge deal. Links are there not only as a quick way to get to source material. They remind you of the questions you need to ask, of the connections that aren’t immediately&nbsp;evident.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We have links.  But in-content links are unlikely to be there to remind <em>you</em> of a question <em>you need to ask</em>.  Still I can save/post an item that says <code>Read http://hapgood.us/2015/07/21/beyond-conversation/ later, consider how it relates to http://readwrite.com/2009/12/07/memex_xerox_trailmeme</code>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Links are made by readers as well as writers.</strong> A stunning thing that we forget, but the link here is not part of the author’s intent, but of the reader’s analysis. The majority of links in the memex are made by readers, not&nbsp;writers.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When you make a link you are a writer!  Associations and links are&nbsp;content.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Links are outside the text.</strong> A corollary perhaps of the above, but since links are a personal take by readers on the relationships of two items, the links cannot be encoded in the document, because that enforces a single interpretation of the document. Links inside the document say that there can only be one set of associations for the document, which would be&nbsp;silly.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Envy!  If the document contains links how does that stop anyone from making links outside the document?  The only real critique I see is that having links inside the document we remove most demand and affordances for anything&nbsp;more.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>There are both linear trails and side trails.</strong>  This may be weird to our modern sensibilities, but clearly Bush has scenarios in mind where you’d follow a more or less linear reading path, and scenarios where you’d have a lot of side&nbsp;paths.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;m pretty sure we have these.  A link to &#8220;Page 2&#8221; is a linear trail from Page 1.  You might even say that the See Other section in a Wikipedia article is linear.  Inline links might be merely related or a source of inspiration (though that&#8217;s a link form that is on the decline) or it might add depth, background,&nbsp;evidence.</p>
<h2>On The Web Everything Is A&nbsp;Document</h2>
<p>This idea that <em>linking is outside the document</em> is unnecessary: links become documents.  Everything is a document of some&nbsp;sort.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But this memex thing isn’t how the Internet works. There is no class of trail blazers. You don’t share a set of linked documents with a friend. You don’t own the documents you read. Links are boring references to supporting material, not prompts for though or a model of expert&nbsp;thinking.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He&#8217;s describing the entire Internet!  I want to share a set of linked documents?  I throw the links into a document.  Get fancier?  Make it a blog post.  Maybe I don&#8217;t &#8220;finish&#8221; the idea?  If you want to know at least one facet of a person&#8217;s thinking, follow their feed (whatever the medium): a personal storyline of&nbsp;stuff-I-want-to-share-and-talk-about.</p>
<p>If you want to link two documents it&#8217;s as simple as putting those two links next to each other.  Insert a few words between the links and you practically have an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_Description_Framework#Overview"><span class="caps">RDF</span> triple</a>, only written for&nbsp;humans.</p></div>
