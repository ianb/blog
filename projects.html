<h2><span id="llm"><span class="caps">LLM</span>&nbsp;period</span></h2>
<p>I started using <span class="caps">GPT</span> in October 2022 (<span class="caps">GPT</span>-3 text-davinci-002), applying it to some long-standing frustrations I had using <span class="caps">NLP</span> with voice interfaces. It immediately solved problems I had struggled with for years, and at that point I was hooked. Here&#8217;s some of what I&#8217;ve done with LLMs&nbsp;(newest-first):</p>
<dl>
<dt id="memory-atlas"><a href="https://youtu.be/xjJRB9i9220?si=cMvorYNro34mg0FF">Memory Atlas (video&nbsp;demo)</a></dt>
<dd>This is a (prototype) app for making personal catalogs of your household items (or maybe anything?). It uses voice for the data input, with the <span class="caps">LLM</span> structuring the transcript and managing the resulting database. I started this as a personal project for my own decluttering, using ad hoc <span class="caps">AI</span> tools to make lists of belongs in my house. But it&#8217;s a concept I&#8217;ve been thinking about for years. I think I&#8217;ll do more with&nbsp;this.</dd>

<dt id="intra-game"><a href="https://github.com/ianb/intra-game">Intra: the&nbsp;game</a></dt>
<dd>I wrote this for a <a href="https://textadventurehack.com/">Retro <span class="caps">AI</span> Quest</a> hackathon (which I won!) You can play it on <a href="https://www.playintra.win/">www.playintra.win</a> (you will need to bring your own <span class="caps">API</span> access using <a href="https://openrouter.ai/">OpenRouter</a>). You can also see a <a href="https://youtu.be/k4xybFjEONw?si=uV8fg2uq5ZhuK74s">demo video</a> of the entry, though I&#8217;ve made a lot of changes and improvements since then.
<br /><br />
This is the most recent incarnation of various <span class="caps">LLM</span>-based roleplaying experiments I&#8217;ve done. The most interesting features are:
<ol>
<li>Concrete world state managed outside the <span class="caps">LLM</span>. There are locations and characters, with mutable but concrete attributes, and the <span class="caps">LLM</span> prompts make use of this state and can update&nbsp;it.</li>
<li>The history log lets the game construct history from different perspectives. Character prompts include just the history items the character would have directly&nbsp;viewed.</li>
<li>User input is mediated, so that instead of directly talking or acting, the input is reinterpreted within the constraints of the&nbsp;game.</li>
<li>Characters have (limited) schedules and purposes, and the game runs on a clock. Lunchtime discussion can get pretty&nbsp;excitable.</li>
<li><span class="caps">LLM</span>-generated summaries. Like in a text adventure you go in a room and get a description of the room; in the game the <span class="caps">LLM</span> takes the room, the characters, what the characters are up to, and creates a brief&nbsp;description.</li>
<li>Some action resolution with dice&nbsp;rolling.</li>
</ol>
Still I&#8217;m struggling to make it into a &#8220;game&#8221;. Specifically: clear, achievable goals, with a larger arc to the game, and enough feedback for the player to know they are on&nbsp;track.
</dd>

<dt id="brilliant">At&nbsp;Brilliant</dt>
<dd>There&#8217;s nothing public to show here, but some of the projects I worked on during my time at <a href="https://brilliant.org/">Brilliant.org</a>.
<dl>
<dt><span class="caps">LLM</span>&nbsp;Infrastructure</dt>
<dd>Typed prompts, tools, and pipelines; typed prompt templates; prompt and model comparison tools; using Wolfram Language to verify math; self-critique&nbsp;pipelines</dd>
<dt>Content Enhancement <span class="amp">&amp;</span>&nbsp;Generation</dt>
<dd>Generating practice problems (interpolated from existing problems); precalculating (helpful) feedback for common wrong answers to open-form questions; feedback for multiple choice wrong answers; contextualized word definitions and explanations; on-demand translation (like into Spanish); experimenting with auxiliary voice output with <span class="caps">LLM</span> rewriting (to translate equations to a spoken form); review tools and human-in-the-loop tools for generated&nbsp;content</dd>
<dt>Code&nbsp;Generation</dt>
<dd><span class="caps">LLM</span> migration of proprietary code; chat-based modification of Interactives code; pipelines to distill and understand hybrid code/text&nbsp;documents</dd>
<dt>Search <span class="amp">&amp;</span>&nbsp;Analysis</dt>
<dd>Embedding search across the <span class="caps">CMS</span> and interactive codebase; tool for ad hoc analysis of our lessons; <span class="caps">SQL</span> chat&nbsp;tool</dd>
</dl>
</dd>

<dt id="z3">Helping an <span class="caps">LLM</span> Reason Using&nbsp;Z3</dt>
<dd>This was an experiment in having LLMs write <a href="https://github.com/Z3Prover/z3">z3 code</a> to solve <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zebra_Puzzle">Zebra Puzzles</a>. It took a fair amount of prompting, but they were able to solve pretty difficult puzzles. Or at least Claude Sonnet 3.5 was. I made a <a href="https://youtu.be/UjSf0rA1blc?si=6XjAnBaXH5rz953D">20min demo video</a> and also had a <a href="https://youtu.be/TUAmfi8Ws1g?si=0KBQuN66nZyK357K">conversation about it</a> at the <a href="https://bstn.cc/">Boston Computation Club</a>.</dd>

<dt id="lifelived"><a href="http://a-life-lived.com/">A Life Lived</a> and <a href="http://worldwanderer.xyz/">World&nbsp;Wanderer</a></dt>
<dd>These are a pair of experimental games that I reflected on in <a href="https://ianbicking.org/blog/2024/04/roleplaying-by-llm">Roleplaying driven by an <span class="caps">LLM</span>: observations <span class="amp">&amp;</span> open questions.</a>
<br /><br />
<strong>A Life Lived</strong>: I developed this one first, and it&#8217;s the more important of the two to me. The goal: place yourself (or rather your character) with a family in a place and time in history. Then, playing your character, you make a series of choices that affect how your life develops, finally creating a biography of the full life of this character.
<br /><br />
You can play this on <a href="http://a-life-lived.com/">a-life-lived.com</a> (also bring your own key). And there&#8217;s a <a href="https://youtu.be/u49KwijAwm8">16min demo video.</a>
<br /><br />
I feel pretty good about the character setup. But &#8220;making a series of choices for your character&#8221; is a trick I haven&#8217;t really figured out. What I implemented is a kind of scenario builder and then it plays out via chat/roleplay. Like &#8220;Greta&#8217;s loyalty and moral compass are tested as she navigates family bonds versus the potential risk to her family&#8217;s safety (Berlin, 1961)&#8221; – interesting premise, but actually playing it out felt confusing and mushy.
<br /><br />
<strong>World Wanderer</strong>: I wanted to step back from <em>Life Lived</em> and tried out another version. Instead of ambiguous life goals, I thought I&#8217;d take the worldbuilding examples I&#8217;d created before and make them an explorable world.
<br /><br />
This is available on <a href="https://worldwanderer.xyz/">worldwanderer.xyz</a>, and has a <a href="https://youtu.be/1EoYmNGIMgo">12min demo video</a>.
<br /><br />
Character setup is a simpler skill level system (e.g., cleverness: <em>foolish</em> and charisma: <em>magnetic</em>), and another structured relationship system (so NPCs can grow to have an opinion or reaction to you). The funnest part by far is the action resolution: you can make attempts at actions (as varied as <em>befriend a sparrow</em> and <em>haggle to buy a potion</em>), your skills are engaged, roll dice, and you get an outcome.
<br /><br />
But the rest of the game isn&#8217;t really that fun. You are wandering around an imaginary city frozen in time. Every location just sits there, every <span class="caps">NPC</span> stares at a wall, until you engage them.
<br /><br />
I tried to improve on several of the issues I bumped into when making <a href="#intra-game">Intra</a>. But there&#8217;s still a lot left in these games that I still want to explore&nbsp;further.
</dd>

<dt id="fungpt"><a href="https://github.com/ianb/fungpt">FunGPT</a></dt>
<dd>I created this framework for the purpose of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qzczZABGzbQ">a 45min presentation I gave</a> at <a href="https://minnestar.org/minnebar/">Minnebar</a>.
<br /><br />
I tried to make something a bit simpler than the <span class="caps">LLM</span> Garden, and experimented with some different control flows to make programming in the browser feel a little more like programming in a text console (more like input/output). Though I don&#8217;t use these patterns in my newer work, they do really work pretty well for chat.
<br /><br />
I made a few little things using this framework (all of which are in the repository). But I probably played the most with chat, with <a href="https://github.com/ianb/fungpt/blob/main/src/routes/chat/summary-chat.js">&#8220;summary chat&#8221;</a> probably being the most complete implementation. A lot of what I did in this chat would show up in later games. I think it&#8217;s one of these versions that I used when comparing <a href="https://hachyderm.io/@ianbicking/110359139615510487">my William Shakespear to Khanmigo&#8217;s</a>. The chat isn&#8217;t that complicated, but it has several features to manage context size and ensure chat history saliency.

<dt id="llm-garden"><a href="https://llm.ianbicking.org/"><span class="caps">LLM</span>&nbsp;Garden</a></dt>

<dd>Available on <a href="https://github.com/ianb/llm-garden">GitHub</a>, this is the first playground I setup to experiment with LLMs, starting in the <span class="caps">GPT3</span> text-davinci-003 era.
<br /><br />
There&#8217;s a series of experiments in it:
<dl>
<dt>Make Your Own&nbsp;Adventure</dt>
<dd>This is a Choose Your Own Adventure builder/authoring tool. It doesn&#8217;t make these on the fly, but instead uses the <span class="caps">LLM</span> to fill out the story and choices. It was a good lesson (which is to say, not successful), and I learned a lot about the issues of hallucination and establishing ground truth, as the stories would meander&nbsp;terribly.</dd>
<dt>People&nbsp;Sim</dt>
<dd>I suppose you would call this a &#8220;multi-agent story teller&#8221;. But really I was just trying to drive scenes using a prompt for each character, and having them react to each other. It was a good lesson in <span class="caps">GPT</span>&#8217;s difficulty with plot resolution and definitive action. Characters in these stories would vamp forever just to avoid revealing the (actually undetermined) conclusion. I made a <a href="https://youtu.be/nsIPC_eqfwg?si=EWbw1eYSwScZ9ahl">15min demo video</a>.</dd>
<dt>Zork&nbsp;player</dt>
<dd>I ran Zork in the browser and had <span class="caps">GPT</span> try to act as the player. <a href="https://youtu.be/clENPDMFP_k?si=oOuHRccjWDknIvi9">7min demo</a>. Mostly it didn&#8217;t do that well. Going in I thought a text adventure might be a good grounding for <span class="caps">LLM</span>-based agents/NPCs, so they could only act independently through the text interface while the game checked the validity of their moves. After I came to see text adventures as pretty limited point-and-click games, except you point and click using&nbsp;words.</dd>
<dt>p5.js&nbsp;Drawing</dt>
<dd>This was an experiment to have <span class="caps">GPT</span> write code for <a href="https://p5js.org/">p5.js</a>, a JavaScript successor to the Processing learning environment. <a href="https://youtu.be/IMcvNIGayjo?si=DjkNR0KBubvWfHyN">10min demo video</a>. I guess I didn&#8217;t find it that interesting, as I didn&#8217;t continue&nbsp;experimenting.</dd>
<dt>LayerCraft</dt>
<dd>This is the engine underneath the worldbuilding tool that I made (see <a href="https://ianbicking.org/blog/2023/02/world-building-with-gpt">World Building With <span class="caps">GPT</span></a> and particularly <a href="https://ianbicking.org/blog/2023/04/world-building-gpt-2-declarative">part 2</a>, as well as this <a href="https://youtu.be/4DEibveZ-n8?si=_GOn9ar-slSWIZ1v">16min demo </a>).
<br /><br />
The actual tool is fairly generic. It is meant to generate hierachical imaginative <em>stuff</em> with (human) authorial direction. A specific domain like building a city is defined in <a href="https://github.com/ianb/llm-garden/blob/main/src/layercraft/citymakerschema.js">a series of prompts</a>. A parent prompt sets up the context – like &#8220;medieval city&#8221; – and then further down prompts cover neighborhoods, buildings, people, etc. At each level you can make choices and influence the generation. Once all the prerequisite information is created then entities lower down in the hierarchy can be created (e.g., once you&#8217;ve defined a neighborhood, the <span class="caps">LLM</span> will start brainstorming the buildings in that neighborhood).
<br /><br />
I have had a lot of fun with this tool, as much as anything I&#8217;ve created. While I filled it out most for this particular worldbuilding task, I did some other smaller personal projects that also worked well. It uses the prompt templates themselves to define the dependency structure of the pipelines, which is kind of cool. I&#8217;d like to come back to&nbsp;it.</dd>
</dl>

<dt id="iaia"><a href="https://ianbicking.org/blog/2023/01/infinite-ai-array">Infinite <span class="caps">AI</span>&nbsp;Array</a></dt>
<dd>I wrote it as an extended gag, though <a href="https://github.com/ianb/infinite-ai-array/blob/main/iaia/infinite_ai_array.py">it&#8217;s also real code</a>. Transparent <span class="caps">LLM</span> access through Python lists and dicts! Created-on-demand functions! And it uses some pretty gnarly Python introspection. So&#8230; it&#8217;s a gag, but it&#8217;s also cool in its own weird&nbsp;way.</dd>

</dl>

<h2><span id="mozilla">Mozilla&nbsp;Period</span></h2>
<p>This is some of what I worked on in the second phase of my career at&nbsp;Mozilla.</p>
<dl>

<dt id="firefox-voice"><a href="https://github.com/mozilla-extensions/firefox-voice/">Firefox&nbsp;Voice</a></dt>
<dd>Firefox Voice was our project out of the now-defunct Consumer Voice Products team, in the now-defunct voice program in Mozilla, part of the now-defunct Emerging Technologies division.<br><br>
Firefox Voice is a voice assistant for the browser, allowing the simple commands like &#8220;new tab&#8221; as well as routing and interpreting messages to Google (&#8220;what&#8217;s the weather&#8221;), integrating with music services (&#8220;play David Bowie&#8221;) and many other commands.<br><br>
At least for a while (I&#8217;m writing this in August 2020) it&#8217;s available <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/firefox-voice/">on addons.mozilla.org</a>.<br><br>
I wrote some thoughts coming out of this project in <a href="https://www.ianbicking.org/blog/2020/08/thoughts-on-voice-interfaces.html">Thoughts on Voice Interfaces</a>.</dd>

<dt id="firefox-screenshots"><a href="https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots"><strong>Firefox&nbsp;Screenshots</strong></a></dt>
<dd>I started Page Shot (which became Firefox Screenshots) in October 2014. During that time I went from doing it as a small side project, to managing the project during its nascent stages, then when I left management I rejoined development to get it launched as a <a href="https://testpilot.firefox.com/experiments/page-shot">Test Pilot experiment</a>. During that period it went from being a page freezing tool (similar to the Way Back Machine) to a screenshot tool.<br><br>
It was popular inside Test Pilot experiment channel, and it wasn&#8217;t much later when it re-launched as a core Firefox feature in September 2017. When it launched it was the first Mozilla product built that took unencrypted user content, that used Google Analytics, the first Firefox feature to ship as a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions">WebExtension</a>, and the first use of <a href="https://sentry.io/welcome/">Sentry</a> to monitor errors in the browser. <br><br>
For myself, Screenshots has been a lesson in managed expectations, but also a lesson in <a href="https://www.ianbicking.org/blog/2018/02/web-small-composable-tools.html">providing simple tools</a> without worrying about how hard they are to create. <br><br>
Despite being popular, in 2019 the server component of Screenshots is being shut down, though the tool will otherwise remain in Firefox. During its life 36 million people used the Screenshots server with over 100 million screenshots uploaded. About 20% of screenshots created are uploaded (instead of being downloaded or copied to the clipboard), so it would be reasonable to estimate 500 million screenshots taken in the course of two&nbsp;years.</dd>

<dt id="side-view"><a href="https://github.com/mozilla/side-view"><strong>Side&nbsp;View</strong></a></dt>
<dd>Another <a href="https://testpilot.firefox.com/experiments/side-view">Test Pilot experiment</a>, this makes it easy to open a mobile view of a website in the Firefox sidebar. I&#8217;m mostly proud that we kept it simple and&nbsp;usable.</dd>

<dt id="email-tabs"><a href="https://github.com/mozilla/email-tabs"><strong>Email&nbsp;Tabs</strong></a></dt>
<dd>Another <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/email-tabs/">Test Pilot experiment</a>. This was strongly influenced by <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/ux/2015/02/save-share-revisit/">Mozilla&#8217;s user research</a>. The results of our research was clear: everyone loves to save and share things by email. And yet it took me a few years to sit down and quickly hack out a tool that makes emailing articles work well. Working with email, and poking around in other company&#8217;s email products, is a bit like science: you have to see what works, nothing works by default or because you want it to work a certain way.<br><br>
I&#8217;m excited by Email Tabs, in no small part because of the simplicity and power of prepopulating compositions. Composing (but not sending) an email is transparent, manipulable, and open-ended. I hope I have the chance to use this lesson elsewhere. The browser is a great location for this, because the browser can integrate with systems in the same way a user integrates with systems, which isn&#8217;t just handy but also is a kind of working in the open: you can see and understand what the automation does, because it does what you might have done. I wrote some thoughts in <a href="https://www.ianbicking.org/blog/2018/11/thoughts-on-email-tabs.html">Thoughts on the Firefox Email Tabs&nbsp;experiment</a></dd>

<dt id="personal-history"><a href="https://github.com/ianb/personal-history-archive/"><strong>Personal History&nbsp;Archive</strong></a></dt>
<dd>I&#8217;ve been poking around at this project for a long time, never really finishing it or deciding exactly what to do with it. The underlying goal is to support local, personal experimentation with the data that can come out of a browser. Most collection like this emphasizes data collected from many aggregate sources, either from select sources or with anonymization, and with only a rough outline of user behavior. A user agent (like a browser) sees everything! It doesn&#8217;t just see that you visited a site, it sees exactly what that site displayed. It doesn&#8217;t just see that you have an email, every email you read is displayed by the browser.<br><br>
So this is a tool to try to collect all that intimate data in a way that supports personal experimentation. Especially experimentation that can produce tools uniquely suited for a user agent that belongs to the user, touching data you&#8217;d never want to give to an external service.<br><br>
Also I have just been poking around with creating highly usable data dumps, where the data is clean, always well-formed, and where behavioral and more static data is mixed together in a usable&nbsp;way.</dd>

<dt id="test-pilot"><a href="https://www.ianbicking.org/blog/2019/03/firefox-experiments-i-would-have-liked.html">Test Pilot Firefox experiment&nbsp;backlog</a></dt>
<dd>Although I was able to ship some things in Test Pilot, there was a long backlog of ideas, and experiments I started but didn&#8217;t work out or weren&#8217;t able to be shipped. I made a list of&nbsp;them!</dd>

<h2><span id="retired">Projects I&#8217;ve retired&nbsp;from</span></h2>
<p>Download stats <a href="https://packaging.python.org/guides/analyzing-pypi-package-downloads/">aren&#8217;t necessarily accurate</a>, but as of June 2019 pip and virtualenv (which I originally wrote) were downloaded 980 million and 150 million times respectively.

The balance of <a href="https://gist.github.com/ianb/0a2fa5cd75f6d2ef04c71c546d2df692">packages I have written/started</a> have been downloaded roughly 70 million times, most notably WebOb, Paste, PasteScript, PasteDeploy, WebTest, Tempita, SQLObject, and&nbsp;INITools.</p>
<h2><span id="collaboration">Collaboration /&nbsp;general</span></h2>

<dt><a id="hotdish" href="https://togetherjs.com/hotdish/"><strong>Hotdish</strong></a></dt>
<dd>This took some of the ideas of TogetherJS, some of the tech from <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/browsermirror">Browser Mirror</a>, and thinking about them all in the context of a browser session.  It&#8217;s implemented as a Firefox addon.  The model we came to is one where a group of people share everything they do in a specific browser, with mutual awareness of what each person is doing (both in general, and with in-page feedback using TogetherJS), and people can join and present to each other in this context.  <br><br>  Our longer-term goal was for people to be able to understand what each other are doing &#8212; what pages they are interacting with, but also <em>how</em> they are interacting with those pages, similar to how you can understand what a person is doing when they are doing physical work.  <br><br>  Another goal is to look at how, using the same data we capture in order to share a person&#8217;s actions with everyone else, we can also use that data to create a richer record of what people are doing.  We wanted knowledge capture and transfer between group members that can encompass not just one site or document, but a session, discussion, and research. <br><br> I <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cJQBBHfF9c&feature=youtu.be&vq=hd720">narrated a screencast that we made</a> to explain some of the concepts and things we learned from the experiment.<br><br>
Some blog posts on the topic: <a href="https://www.ianbicking.org/blog/2014/02/defaulting-to-together.html">Defaulting To Together</a>, and <a href="https://www.ianbicking.org/blog/2014/02/hubot-chat-web-working-in-the-open.html">Hubot, Chat, The Web, and Working in the Open</a>.</dd>

<dt id="togetherjs"><a href="https://togetherjs.com"><strong>TogetherJS</strong></a></dt>
<dd>TogetherJS was my last (shipped) project at the <a href="https://www.ianbicking.org/blog/2014/09/professional-transitions.html">first iteration of the now twice-defunct Mozilla Labs</a>.  TogetherJS is a library and service to enable real-time collaboration on any site. It can still be seen on <a href="https://jsfiddle.net/">JSFiddle</a> where it is used for live collaboration.<br><br>
The larger vision for TogetherJS falls under the category of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cobrowsing">Cobrowsing</a>: basically experiencing the web or a website collaboratively. We really wanted to explore what it meant to interact with things side-by-side, moving in and out of synchronous collaboration.<br><br>

<dt><a href="http://doctestjs.org">doctest.js</a></dt>
<dd>A testing framework for Javascript, inspired by Python&#8217;s <a href="http://docs.python.org/2/library/doctest.html">doctest</a>. Something of an alternative to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior-driven_development"><span class="caps">BDD</span></a>, based on examples and expected output. Blog post: <a href="https://www.ianbicking.org/blog/2012/10/02/why-doctest-js-is-better-than-pythons-doctest/">Why doctest.js is better than Python’s doctest</a>.</dd>

<dt><a href="https://github.com/ianb/walkabout.js">walkabout.js</a></dt>
<dd>This is something like a <span class="caps">UI</span>/<span class="caps">DOM</span> fuzzing library.  It inspects the <span class="caps">DOM</span> (or uses rewritten Javascript code) to determine what parts of the page are &#8220;live&#8221; (and in what way).  Then it can choose a random action to perform, like clicking on an element or entering text in a&nbsp;field.</dd>

<dt><a href="https://github.com/ianb/seeitsaveit">SeeItSaveIt</a></dt>
<dd>An experiment in extracting structured data from web sites.  Works as a Firefox addon.  This is basically furloughed (as of April 2013) pending progress on <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/WebAPI/WebActivities">Web Activities</a>.  The addon allows custom scrapers to be run on sites, with several levels of separation to both allow scraping scripts to run safely and isolated from the site receiving the data.  There is some more information <a href="https://ianb.github.io/seeitsaveit/">on this site</a>.</dd>

<dt><a href="https://github.com/ianb/thecutout/">The&nbsp;Cut-Out</a></dt>
<dd>A synchronization library.  This is intended for <span class="caps">HTML</span>/Javascript applications that keep all their data locally, but want to be able to synchronize that data between devices.  But it&#8217;s perhaps overpowered for that minor task.  This includes several pieces, a client library, a protocol, a server, an on-disk database format, and some rough replication and balancing support. It was an experiment in&nbsp;minimalism.</dd>

<dt><a href="https://github.com/mozilla/browsermirror">Browser&nbsp;Mirror</a></dt>
<dd>This project has largely been superceded by <a href="https://togetherjs.com">TogetherJS.</a>.  This is like a screensharing system, except it works with the <span class="caps">DOM</span> instead of pixels - the page you are viewing is transmitted to the other party, but not a &#8220;live&#8221; page, literally just the things you see.  Things like clicks are transmitted back to the original browser.  Just like screensharing&#8230;?  Started out as a &#8220;this can&#8217;t possibly work&#8221; project, but then it kind of&nbsp;worked.</dd>

<dt><a href="https://github.com/ianb/webannotate">webannotate</a></dt>
<dd>An offshoot of BrowserMirror and related ideas, taking a snapshot of the <span class="caps">DOM</span> and saving it, then allowing annotation of that static page.  Like inline commenting without any of the tricky web overlay&nbsp;ideas.</dd>

<h3><span id="packaging">Python&nbsp;Packaging</span></h3>
<p>I don&#8217;t currently work on these Python projects, but I authored some important (and now core) parts of the Python packaging&nbsp;ecosystem.</p>
<dl>

<dt><a href="http://www.pip-installer.org/">pip</a></dt>
<dd>The Python Installer Program.  A very popular installation tool for Python.  I wrote this as a kind of response to <code>easy_install</code>, not because I hated easy_install, but because I knew it should be better and that it had relatively small problems that made people hate it.  Pip solved problems people wanted solved, and it&#8217;s been very popular since&nbsp;then.</dd>

<dt><a href="http://www.virtualenv.org/">virtualenv</a></dt>
<dd>This is an environment isolation tool for Python.  The functionality is now going to be built more directly into Python itself, but virtualenv remains very popular for managing projects. <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/workingenv.py">workingenv</a> was an early attempt at the same concept, but virtualenv stuck because it works really well.  It&#8217;s just the right level of hack to get everything to work consistently and&nbsp;well.</dd>

</dl>

<h3><span id="pythonweb">Python&nbsp;Web</span></h3>
<p>There&#8217;s a bunch of projects that I&#8217;ve worked on in the web space, either authoring or making major contributions. I&#8217;m not actively working on any of these myself any&nbsp;more.</p>
<p>Some of the projects in this list are popular, some I think were influential. Several of them I <em>wish</em> were&nbsp;influential.</p>
<dl>

<dt><a href="http://webob.org/">WebOb</a></dt>
<dd><p>WebOb is a Python request and response library (along with some other miscellaneous&nbsp;pieces).</p>

<p>WebOb was an extraction of the ideas in Paste (as seen below), but with a bit more opinion.  It&#8217;s also the result of letting a bunch of ideas gel for a while.  WebOb has a very specific scope, and implements everything within that scope in an incredibly thorough way. Its completeness exceeds any other Python project I&#8217;m aware of (and other languages to the degree I&#8217;m aware fo them).  WebOb understands <span class="caps">HTTP</span> really well - and it knows how to both read and write <span class="caps">HTTP</span>, client and server.  It&#8217;s primarily focused on being a library for servers, but it can generate requests and parse responses as well, making it uniquely appropriate for middle&nbsp;layers.</p>

<p>WebOb is the basis of many Python web frameworks, Pyramid/Pylons probably foremost among them.  (Django and Werkzeug/Flask being the notable&nbsp;exceptions.)</p></dd>

<dt><a href="http://pythonpaste.org/">Paste&nbsp;Core</a></dt>
<dd><p>Paste, as well as Paste Deploy and Paste Script, were part of a general effort to write a <em>web framework toolkit</em>.  Each contained low-level routines for different&nbsp;tasks.</p>

<p>Paste core is primarily concerned with a set of independent tools for use with <a href="http://wsgi.readthedocs.org/"><span class="caps">WSGI</span></a>.  This includes things like simple routing, static file serving (later turned into <code>webob.static</code>), exception reporting and debugging (later turned into WebError), validation (would become <code>wsgiref.validate</code>), logging, testing (would turn into WebTest), <span class="caps">CGI</span> routing, and other&nbsp;stuff.</p>

<p>Where possible much of this has been moved into WebOb or other packages built on&nbsp;WebOb.</p>

<p>The context in which Paste was created was one with a lot of competing Python web frameworks, where there was little overlap in the technology those frameworks used.  Paste tried to create a basic foundation for sharing technology, while still allowing diversity in the actual web frameworks themselves.  It succeeded to a&nbsp;degree.</p>

<p>Paste contained the first web-based interactive debugger for Python (if or when similar tools were built for other languages, I don&#8217;t know).  Other tools are better now, but Paste pioneered the&nbsp;idea.</p>
</dd>

<dt><a href="http://pythonpaste.org/deploy/">Page&nbsp;Deploy</a></dt>
<dd>Part of the Paste project, this is a configuration system for web apps.  It has been used for a few things; for configuration during actual deployment and for application composition&nbsp;primarily.</dd>

<dt><a href="http://pythonpaste.org/script/">Paste&nbsp;Script</a></dt>
<dd>Also part of the Paste project, this is a kind of framework for building command-line tools to build applications, and some useful commands to go with.  It includes things like a web server <em>container</em> (does that make sense?), and by far the most popular piece has been <code>paster create</code> which helps setup boilerplate files for new&nbsp;projects.</dd>

<dt><a href="https://bitbucket.org/ianb/silverlining/src">Silver&nbsp;Lining</a></dt>
<dd>This was an attempt to create a general web application hosting framework.  Vaguely like Heroku; you&#8217;d lay your application out in a certain way, and using Silver Lining you could create a new server instance and upload and update your application.  It supported both Python and <span class="caps">PHP</span>, with the potential for other languages in the future. I thought it was really cool, but no one else really got on board. Maybe once you decide to give up this level of control you would rather just pay for the service instead of using an open source product.  I&#8217;m not sure.  This was kind of my last hurrah for server-side web&nbsp;projects.</dd>

<dt id="webtest"><a href="http://webtest.pythonpaste.org/">WebTest</a></dt>
<dd>This is a WebOb rewrite of <code>paste.fixture</code>.  WebTest is a tool to make functional tests of your <span class="caps">WSGI</span>-using web application (not specifically WebOb applications).  It makes it easy to create artificial but full <span class="caps">HTTP</span> requests, send them to your application, and provides a bunch of helpers to inspect the results.  One feature I think is notable (not <em>challenging</em>, just notable) is that it always contains an implicit &#8220;this request should work&#8221; assertion. Other similar frameworks force you to write <code>assertEqual(resp.code, 200)</code> all the time; what nonsense! In WebTest this is implied unless you say otherwise.  It does form parsing and cookie storage and other stuff&nbsp;too.</dd>

<dt><a href="http://www.formencode.org/">FormEncode</a></dt>
<dd>A form validation and conversion toolkit for web applications. It&#8217;s built on the idea of a two-way validation/conversion pipeline, structuring an destructuring the content of <span class="caps">HTML</span> forms.  It also includes <code>formencode.htmlfill</code>, a library to rewrite forms to insert form values; a novel approach, one that I think deserved to be used more, but like much of FormEncode probably obsolete now as client-side validation is more appropriate.  Like many Hard Problems of web development in the previous decade, this hard problem is best avoided instead of&nbsp;solved.</dd>

<dt><a href="http://lxml.de/lxmlhtml.html">lxml.html (and&nbsp;cssselect)</a></dt>
<dd><p>I didn&#8217;t write lxml (the general <span class="caps">XML</span> and <span class="caps">HTML</span> Python library, based on libxml2).  But I did write the <span class="caps">HTML</span>-specific wrapper in lxml, which exposes <span class="caps">HTML</span>-specific semantics.  This adds knowledge of links to lxml, and forms, and some other stuff - all of which has made lxml an excellent <a href="https://ianbicking.org/2008/12/10/lxml-an-underappreciated-web-scraping-library/">screen scraping&nbsp;library</a></p>

<p>I also wrote <code>lxml.cssselect</code>.  libxml2 contains an XPath parser, and cssselect translates <span class="caps">CSS3</span> selectors to XPath expressions.  If you are curious what this looks like, <a href="http://css2xpath.appspot.com">css2xpath</a> is a little webapp to do those same translations.  I hope you will agree that XPath is&nbsp;ugly.</p></dd>

<dt><a href="http://pythonpaste.org/commentary/">Commentary</a></dt>
<dd>An experiment in commenting on web pages.  Worked as an intermediary to the web page, which turned out to be extremely fragile.  Also this was before we had good <span class="caps">HTML</span> parsing available, so it had to use the Old Terrible Tools (like an <span class="caps">HTML</span> <span class="caps">SAX</span> parser).  I think <a href="https://code.google.com/p/rietveld/">Rietveld&#8217;s <span class="caps">UI</span></a> was inspired by&nbsp;this.</dd>

<dt><a href="https://ianbicking.org/introducing-htconsole.html">htconsole</a></dt>
<dd>This was a more ambitious take on the interactive web-based debugger.  Instead it was a generalized interactive console.  It had some clever ideas, like inline live function editing.  It exceeded by Javascript skills in some ways at the time, such that it was just a bit <em>frustrating</em> to work on, and I wasn&#8217;t sure to what end I&#8217;d be using&nbsp;it.</dd>

<dt><a href="http://sqlobject.org/">SQLObject</a></dt>
<dd>It&#8217;s been a long time since I worked on this.  This is one of my first major open source projects, that actually had pickup.  SQLObject is an <span class="caps">ORM</span> (Object Relational Mapper).  It pioneered many metaprogramming techniques in Python, allowing a declarative class statement to be mapped to <span class="caps">SQL</span>, including <span class="caps">SQL</span> expressions.  (NumPy championed some of these features, but I believe SQLObject was the first to use these features for <span class="caps">SQL</span> expressions.)  The project is still active, but not very active.  But SQLObject was an inspiration for features in frameworks like&nbsp;SQLAlchemy.</dd>

<dt><a href="http://pythonpaste.org/tempita/">Tempita</a></dt>
<dd>A very small templating language.  I sometimes wanted to generate strings and simply string substitution could be too hard, and I wanted a no-frills no-complications template language.  I think Tempita is really pretty slick.  It also avoids the unnecessary punctuation other template languages have.  It also supports structured content, I think <a href="http://svn.colorstudy.com/home/ianb/recipes/sqltemplate.py">sqltemplate</a> is really cool, though I stopped using <span class="caps">SQL</span> before I wrote&nbsp;it.</dd>

<dt><a href="https://bitbucket.org/ianb/referrertrack">referrertrack</a></dt>
<dd>An App Engine tool that uses the Google Analytics <span class="caps">API</span> to get a comprehensive list of referrers.  You could use this to watch for <em>every</em> referrer that came to your site, and check them off as you checked each one out.  No one ever cared, but I found it useful (until it bit&nbsp;rotted).</dd>

<dt><a href="http://www.coactivate.org/projects/deliverance/introduction">Deliverance</a></dt>
<dd>This project is now pretty much gone.  It was an <span class="caps">HTTP</span> proxy that would rewrite all the outgoing requests to apply styles to those requests.  The idea was to allow a diverse set of applications to be styled in a consistent way, to make up a&nbsp;&#8220;site&#8221;.</dd>

<dd>A mock library specifically for use with <a href="http://docs.python.org/2/library/doctest.html">doctest</a>. Using doctest, I found it was possible to make a pretty good mock library in almost no code.

<dd>A Logo interpreter written in Python.  A pretty complete implementation of the language, with a lot of support for calling into and out of Logo to&nbsp;Python.</dd>

<dt><a href="https://github.com/ianb/apppkg">apppkg</a></dt>
<dd>A very incomplete design of an &#8220;Application Package&#8221; for Python. Some of the motivation described <a href="https://ianbicking.org/2012/02/29/python-application-package/">here</a>.

<dt><a href="http://svn.pythonpaste.org/ObConfLoader/trunk/">ObConfLoader</a></dt>

<dt><a href="https://github.com/ianb/emailit">EmailIt</a></dt>

<dt><a href="https://ianbicking.org/2007/09/12/flatatompub/">FlatAtomPub</a></dt>
<dd>An Atompub server library.  Atompub <em>was</em> supposed to be the culmination of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer"><span class="caps">REST</span></a> thinking.  This was my attempt to assimilate those ideas.  No one ever actually cared about Atompub though, go figure?  This was an interesting experiment, but never&nbsp;useful.</dd>

<dt><a href="http://pythonpaste.org/ohm/"><span class="caps">OHM</span></a></dt>
<dd>The Object <span class="caps">HTTP</span> Mapper.  An attempt to create an <span class="caps">ORM</span>-like layer for exposing objects over <span class="caps">HTTP</span>.  ORMs are a little suspicious, <span class="caps">OHM</span> was even more suspicious.  These days I&#8217;m pretty <em>over</em> <span class="caps">REST</span>, mostly because attempts like this to embrace <span class="caps">REST</span> were so&nbsp;unsatisfying.</dd>

<dt><a href="FIXME">TaggerClient</a> and <a href="FIXME">TaggerStore</a></dt>
<dd>An attempt to create a generalized tagging library.  Part of a concept of postmodern, ad hoc, and eclectic components making up a web&nbsp;site. </dd>

<dt><a href="http://svn.pythonpaste.org/Paste/VaingloriousEye/trunk/">VaingloriousEye</a></dt>
<dd>My best project name ever.  This was a little piece of <span class="caps">WSGI</span> middleware (a wrapper you could apply around an application) to give live referrer statistics, so you could obsess over who came to your&nbsp;site.</dd>

<dt><a href="http://pythonpaste.org/waitforit/">WaitForIt</a></dt>
<dd>A silly hack of a <span class="caps">WSGI</span> middleware.  This would spawn threads so that a request that took a really long time could progress, while still serving up some status information to the user.  People use Celery queues and stuff like that these days, but for a little while some admin tasks could take a couple minutes, causing timeouts that would then abort the&nbsp;task.</dd>

<dd>An experiment with <a href="http://disruptive-innovations.com/zoo/20040830/HTMLoverlays.html"><span class="caps">HTML</span> Overlays</a>, kind of a microformat-style way of applying a template to a site, using simple directives to lay the content of a page over a template.  Deliverance was a far more complete implementation of the idea, and one that didn&#8217;t require application cooperation, but this is the more refined and simple implementation of the&nbsp;idea.</dd>

<dt><a href="http://pythonpaste.org/wsgiproxy/">WSGIProxy</a></dt>

<dd>Embeds <span class="caps">PHP</span> in Python, as though a <span class="caps">PHP</span> app is another Python <span class="caps">WSGI</span> resource.  Basically a hack to send a FastCGI request to an embedded <span class="caps">PHP</span>&nbsp;process.</dd>

<dt><a href="http://pythonpaste.org/httpencode/">HTTPEncode</a></dt>
<dd>An overly ambitious attempt to embed structured data in web requests, in a way that they could be extracted &#8220;efficiently&#8221; in certain server layouts.  Kind of optimizing an <span class="caps">HTTP</span> request into a function call when both endpoints were on the same&nbsp;server.</dd>

<dd>When App Engine first started it had some things that just felt needlessly different from &#8220;normal&#8221; Python.

<dd>An attempt to provide instructional overlays, so multi-step instructions on how to use a web page could be&nbsp;created.</dd>

<dt><a href="http://svn.colorstudy.com/home/ianb/htranscluder">htranscluder</a></dt>
<dd>This did client-side <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transclusion">transclusion</a> using the microformat <code>&lt;a href="resource" rel="include"&gt;content&lt;/a&gt;</code></dd>

<dd>Working in the open at Mozilla I have had the opportunity to try things out. Sometimes they work out, and sometimes they don&#8217;t. At that stage you&#8217;ll find my work in GitHub, which is updated more frequently than this&nbsp;page.</dd>

<dt><a href="https://github.com/ianb/misc-recipes">Misc&nbsp;recipes</a></dt>
<dd>Before GitHub when I want to try out an idea, I throw it in an <span class="caps">SVN</span> directory.  There&#8217;s a grab bag of experiments here, all from quite a while&nbsp;ago.</dd>

<dt><a href="https://github.com/ianb/whrandom">whrandom</a></dt>
<dd>A small Javascript library for a pseudo-random&nbsp;generator.</dd>

<dt><a href="https://github.com/ianb/javascript">Javascript style&nbsp;guide</a></dt>
<dd>Not a &#8220;project&#8221; per se, but my own customization of the <a href="https://github.com/airbnb/javascript">Airbnb</a> style guide, represents my current and ongoing opinion on Javascript&nbsp;style.</dd>

<dt><a href="https://github.com/ianb/browsercommander">Browser&nbsp;Commander</a></dt>
<dd>An incomplete prototype of a kind of file manager built in the browser.  Includes a small server and client library to provide Node.js APIs in the browser (which are proxied over WebSockets to the&nbsp;server).</dd>

<dt><a href="https://github.com/ianb/git-sync">git-sync</a></dt>
<dd>A small script to use git more like rsync for the purpose of deployment.  Motivation explained some in <a href="https://ianbicking.org/2012/02/14/git-as-sync-not-source-control-as-deployment/">this post</a>.</dd>

<dt><a href="https://github.com/mozilla/receiptverifier">receiptverifier</a></dt>
<dd>Not very active right now.  This is a library to do client verification of <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Apps">Open Web App</a> receipts.  It&#8217;s not very exciting, but it does do a heck of a lot of error handling. It was an exercise in thoroughness. Maintained by other people&nbsp;now.</dd>
