&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hungry or frustrated spirits who have enormous stomachs but mouths only the size of needles, a vast appetite and no means of fulfillment. And this is the manu, the world, that is to say the world of&amp;nbsp;man.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s a vision that flashes in my mind: a grotesque hunger, a need to consume, desperate and never fulfilled,&amp;nbsp;haunted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I see us falling into that kind of desperate hunger, sated just barely as we try to suck sustanance through a narrow straw. And we&amp;#8217;re so hungry, the straw is the only satisfaction we get, and as frustrating as the straw is, it&amp;#8217;s still the only small satisfaction we can find. We suck desperately to get this small nourishment, but the harder we try the more the straw collapses. It seems obsessive, and we tell ourselves and we tell each other that we need to &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;STOP&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OUR&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ADDICTION&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TO&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;THE&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;STRAW&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. But we aren&amp;#8217;t addicted, we are hungry. Abstinance will not save us. To be free we must drink deeply, we must satisfy our hunger. The desire is not wrong. But the straw is our joy and our&amp;nbsp;curse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is how I feel about our phones and social media: they are the narrow straw by which we feed. They give us just enough nourishment to become the focus of our hunger, and yet never satisfy. Our hunger for stimulation, affection, relaxation, for understanding our place in the world and who we&amp;nbsp;are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#8217;t have an answer, but I am open to the idea that we must go &lt;em&gt;through&lt;/em&gt; instead of &lt;em&gt;away&lt;/em&gt;. That we must find a way to drink deeply before we try to cast away the&amp;nbsp;straw.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;div class="aita-title"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;AITA&lt;/span&gt; for Asking My Husband to Stop Setting Off Fireworks Inside the House?&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div class="aita-body"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m a bit unsure if I&amp;#39;m in the wrong here, but I need some perspective. My husband loves fireworks, and lately, he&amp;#39;s taken to setting them off inside our house. This has always made me incredibly nervous, especially since we had a small fire last month because of this. We have two young kids, aged 5 and 7, who get very frightened by the loud noises and sudden flashes. I&amp;#39;ve tried to gently express my concerns, mentioning how dangerous it is, particularly with the kids around and the fact that we have a lot of wooden furniture that could easily catch fire. He just laughs it off and says it&amp;#39;s all in good fun, and that I&amp;#39;m&amp;nbsp;overreacting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t want to ruin his enjoyment, but I&amp;#39;m genuinely scared for our safety and the safety of our children. Last week, one of the fireworks set off the smoke alarm in the middle of the night, waking everyone up and causing a panic. Our daughter had a nightmare and couldn&amp;#39;t go back to sleep. I feel like I&amp;#39;m constantly on edge, worrying about when he&amp;#39;ll decide to set off the next one. Am I being unreasonable or overly cautious by asking him to&amp;nbsp;stop?&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;div class="aita-reply"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NTA&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. Your concerns are completely valid. However, maybe there&amp;#39;s a middle ground that could make everyone happy. What if you create a &amp;#8220;firework room&amp;#8221; in the house? You could line it with fireproof materials and have a ventilation system to handle the smoke. Another idea is to use holographic projections of fireworks in the living room—they&amp;#39;re just as exciting without the mess or&amp;nbsp;danger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or, consider scheduling a weekly &amp;#8220;fireworks night&amp;#8221; in the house. You could cover all the furniture with fireproof blankets, wear fire-resistant suits, and set up fans to blow the smoke out of the windows. Maybe even install a sprinkler system that can quickly douse any flames. This way, your husband can enjoy his fireworks, and you can have peace of mind knowing there&amp;#39;s at least some level of safety in&amp;nbsp;place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;div class="aita-reply"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NTA&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. Your concerns are completely valid. However, you might need to face a more obvious issue here: your husband is probably cheating. Think about it—setting off fireworks inside the house is such bizarre behavior that it could be a distraction tactic. He&amp;#39;s trying to keep you focused on the chaos at home while he&amp;#39;s out doing who knows what. It&amp;#39;s time to open your eyes and see what&amp;#39;s really going&amp;nbsp;on.&lt;/p&gt;

Your husband is just trying to have some fun and bring excitement into your home. Fireworks are memorable and a bit of noise won&amp;#39;t harm the kids. Instead of worrying, you could help them get used to it. Maybe even let them hold sparklers or small fireworks to show them it&amp;#39;s not scary. Lighten up and let your husband enjoy his harmless&amp;nbsp;hobby.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;div class="aita-title"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;AITA&lt;/span&gt; for Requiring My Friends to Solve a Riddle Before Entering My House?&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div class="aita-body"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I, (28M), love puzzles and thought it would be fun to require my friends to solve a riddle before entering my house. It started as a quirky idea to make gatherings more&amp;nbsp;engaging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last weekend, my friend Alex (27F) came over and couldn’t solve the riddle. I thought it was all in good fun and kept insisting she try, thinking it would add to the excitement. She got increasingly frustrated and eventually left. It was only later that I realized how awkward it was for everyone, especially since I was hosting her birthday&amp;nbsp;dinner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe I should have a set of easier questions specifically for guests of a feminine persuasion to avoid making anyone feel uncomfortable. Am I the asshole for not considering this in the first&amp;nbsp;place?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;OP&lt;/span&gt;, I get that you love puzzles and want to make your gatherings unique, but making your guests, especially femoids, solve a riddle to get in? That’s a bit extreme, dude. It’s not like they have the same mental fortitude as&amp;nbsp;us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alex could have put in a bit more effort instead of just walking away in a huff. Maybe have a range of entry challenges to accommodate different abilities. For example, she could have done a cute little dance, recited some lines from a movie, or even tried to impress with a fun fact about makeup or whatever they’re into. It’s about making it inclusive while still keeping it interesting for&amp;nbsp;everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next time, think about alternative challenges that might be easier for femoids to&amp;nbsp;handle.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;div class="aita-reply"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;YTA&lt;/span&gt; for Not Installing a Hint System. Dude, you should have had a hint system in place. How was Alex supposed to solve the riddle without any hints? You could have set up some kind of in-game mechanism where she could earn hints by completing simple tasks around your house. It’s basic quest design—give the players a way to progress if they’re stuck. Not having a hint system made it unfair and frustrating for&amp;nbsp;her.&lt;/p&gt;

You’re the same guy who thought it was a genius idea to charge people for using your bathroom at your last party. Forcing &lt;del&gt;Allison&lt;/del&gt; Alex to solve a riddle to enter your house? Seriously? It&amp;#39;s not like anyone&amp;#39;s dying to get into your dungeon of awkwardness. It’s a miracle anyone even shows up to your events with these ridiculous antics. Maybe next time, just hand out quizzes about your favorite conspiracy theories instead. Get over yourself and stop torturing your friends with your ego&amp;nbsp;trips.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;div class="aita-title"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;AITA&lt;/span&gt; for refusing to let my cat be the ring bearer at my sister’s wedding?&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div class="aita-body"&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, my sister Lisa is getting married to Mr. Perfect, and of course, her wedding has to be the most amazing, unique event ever. Lisa&amp;#39;s always had to be the center of attention, and I&amp;#39;ve gotten used to it. But now, she wants my beloved cat, Whiskers, to be the ring bearer at her wedding. Yes, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MY&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;cat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone in my family is obsessed with Whiskers. They think he&amp;#39;s the most adorable, perfect cat ever. They spoil him with gourmet cat food, designer collars, and constant affection. It’s like Whiskers is the child my parents always wanted but never had – you know, instead of&amp;nbsp;me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lisa and her fiancé even bought a tiny tuxedo for Whiskers and have been practicing with him, trying to get him to walk down the aisle with a pillow tied to his back. They think it&amp;#39;s &amp;#8220;charming&amp;#8221; and &amp;#8220;unconventional.&amp;#8221; Honestly, it&amp;#39;s ridiculous. But no, the real issue here is that they expect me to just hand over my cat for their special&amp;nbsp;day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love Whiskers more than anything, and it’s not fair that Lisa gets to use him as another prop to make her wedding perfect. Everyone is acting like I&amp;#39;m being unreasonable, but Whiskers is &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MINE&lt;/span&gt;. He&amp;#39;s been with me through thick and thin, unlike my family, who always seemed to care more about their latest hobbies and bizarre obsessions (like that time they made us all take ballroom dancing lessons because Lisa wanted to&amp;nbsp;compete).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now they&amp;#39;re all ganging up on me, saying I&amp;#39;m selfish and trying to sabotage the wedding. They don&amp;#39;t see how hard it is for me to watch Lisa get everything she wants, yet again, including my precious Whiskers. They even suggested I move back to the old house for a few days so Whiskers can &amp;#8220;adjust&amp;#8221; before the wedding. Can you believe&amp;nbsp;it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AITA&lt;/span&gt; for putting my foot down and refusing to let my cat be the ring bearer? Or am I just the family villain again, because I won’t let Lisa have her way with everything, including my&amp;nbsp;cat?&lt;/p&gt;

It&amp;#39;s time to take drastic measures. Consider making sure their precious wedding doesn&amp;#39;t go as planned. Just whisk Whiskers away and start anew, just the two of you. Leave behind their toxic influence and cherish the unique journey you and Whiskers can have&amp;nbsp;together.&lt;/p&gt;

Imagine how proud and happy he’ll be, walking down the aisle with all eyes on him. This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for Whiskers, a day he’ll remember forever. Don’t take that away from him just because you’re being possessive. Let him bask in the spotlight and be celebrated like the star he&amp;nbsp;is!&lt;/p&gt;

It’s obvious they’ve been spoiling him behind your back and trying to win his affection. Who knows what kind of treats and toys they’ve been bribing him with? It’s clear he’s more loyal to them now. You shouldn’t have to sacrifice your beloved companion for their wedding, especially when it’s clear Whiskers isn’t as faithful to you as he should be. Stand your&amp;nbsp;ground!&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;div class="aita-title"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;AITA&lt;/span&gt; for Creating a “No Talking” Rule for Guests During My Parrot’s Nap Time?&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div class="aita-body"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I (35F) have a rescue parrot named Kiwi (7M). Kiwi had a rough past—his previous owner would talk loudly on the phone, and it stressed him out, poor little guy. Since rescuing him, I’ve been very protective. Kiwi has a strict nap time from 2 &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PM&lt;/span&gt; to 4 &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PM&lt;/span&gt; to stay calm and&amp;nbsp;healthy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently, I had friends over. I explained Kiwi’s background and asked for complete silence during his nap. No talking, no laughing, not even whispering. I even turned off all electronics, dimmed the lights, and used whiteboards for&amp;nbsp;communication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a couple of friends started talking, I silently pointed to a whiteboard reminder of the rule. They called me unreasonable and ridiculous. I’m just trying to keep Kiwi calm and healthy after everything he’s been&amp;nbsp;through.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;AITA&lt;/span&gt; for insisting on this “no talking” rule for my parrot’s nap&amp;nbsp;time?&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;div class="aita-reply"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;YTA&lt;/span&gt;. Why are you even having people over if Kiwi is so&amp;nbsp;precious?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a mamma, Kiwi’s peace should be your top priority. Your sweet, delicate feathered angel brings light and joy into your life, and you need to prioritize that. Inviting guests knowing Kiwi needs total silence is irresponsible, and makes me wonder if you really care for this little darling. Protect your heavenly little bird at all&amp;nbsp;costs!&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div class="aita-title"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;AITA&lt;/span&gt; for Expecting My Cat to Be More Modest?&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div class="aita-body"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I (29m) have had my cat, Mittens, for two years. She&amp;#39;s a 3-year-old female tabby, and while she&amp;#39;s sweet, she constantly shows her asshole as she walks around the house. I know this is common for cats, but it&amp;#39;s starting to get on my nerves, especially when guests are&amp;nbsp;over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve tried a few different&amp;nbsp;tactics:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clothes:&lt;/strong&gt; I bought some cute cat clothes, but she hates wearing them and always manages to wriggle&amp;nbsp;out.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Redirection:&lt;/strong&gt; I’ve tried distracting her with toys and treats, hoping she&amp;#39;d keep her tail down more, but that hasn’t&amp;nbsp;worked.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Grooming:&lt;/strong&gt; I make sure her fur is brushed and trimmed around her rear end to ensure it&amp;#39;s clean, thinking it might be an itch causing the behavior, but she&amp;#39;s still just as&amp;nbsp;flagrant.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tail Training:&lt;/strong&gt; I even tried gently adjusting her tail position when she&amp;#39;s walking around, but she just goes back to her usual&amp;nbsp;ways.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My friends say I&amp;#39;m being ridiculous and should accept it as part of having a cat, but I can&amp;#39;t help feeling&amp;nbsp;embarrassed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;AITA&lt;/span&gt; for wanting my cat to be more modest, or should I just let it go and accept that this is normal cat&amp;nbsp;behavior?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: I love Mittens, but maybe it&amp;#39;s time to consider if I need a different cat. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AITA&lt;/span&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class="aita-reply"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I understand your frustration, but there might be more to Mittens&amp;#39; behavior than meets the eye. Have you ever considered why animals sometimes act in ways that seem off? Why do they groom certain areas and expose them? Think about who might benefit from these behaviors. Is it just random, or is there a deeper&amp;nbsp;connection?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Look at the symbols and messages around you. Who controls the narrative about animal behavior? Why do some patterns repeat? Follow the clues and trust your instincts. There are hidden truths in the everyday actions of our pets. Do your own research. Stay vigilant. Not everything is as it&amp;nbsp;seems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stay strong. The truth will come to&amp;nbsp;light.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;div class="aita-reply"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;YTA&lt;/span&gt;. Honestly, cat butts are one of the best things about having a cat! It&amp;#39;s a sign of trust and affection. Mittens is just sharing her love with you in her own way! Maybe instead of being embarrassed, you should celebrate her adorable, fuzzy little backside. Embrace the magic of the cat butt! It&amp;#39;s all part of the feline charm!&amp;nbsp;😻🍑&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To help you appreciate it more, why not try taking a daily photo of Mittens&amp;#39; butt and creating a scrapbook? You&amp;#39;ll see how cute and funny it really&amp;nbsp;is!&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;div class="aita-reply"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NTA&lt;/span&gt;. I totally get where you&amp;#39;re coming from—cats can be a nightmare. They&amp;#39;re always causing chaos, triggering allergies, and let&amp;#39;s not even get started on those creepy signs. Ever hear about a cat yawn at midnight bringing bad luck? Did you know If your cat’s ears fold backward while looking at you, it’s channeling dark thoughts into your mind? Honestly, cats are just &amp;#8220;troublesome&amp;#8221; creatures by nature. Maybe it&amp;#39;s time to think about a world with fewer cats and consider a pet that&amp;#39;s more low-maintenance and less&amp;#8230; sinister. You deserve a pet that doesn&amp;#39;t come with all this&amp;nbsp;baggage.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;div class="aita-title"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;AITA&lt;/span&gt; for Expecting My Husband to Respect My Boundaries and Not Talk to Other Women, Including Coworkers?&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div class="aita-body"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I never imagined I&amp;#39;d be in this position, questioning if my feelings and boundaries are valid in my marriage. But here I am, seeking clarity and reassurance from&amp;nbsp;others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;ve been married for six years, and I always feel uneasy when he interacts with other women. It&amp;#39;s not about trust, but I fear these interactions might lead to something more. I feel uncomfortable with him talking to women at work, socially, or casually. A married man should prioritize his wife&amp;#39;s feelings above all&amp;nbsp;else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He thinks I&amp;#39;m overreacting and that his interactions are harmless. But I want to feel like the only woman in his life who gets his attention and affection. He says it&amp;#39;s impractical to avoid all interactions with women at work, but if he truly respected my boundaries, he would manage&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A spouse should be willing to sacrifice for their significant other, right? For example, I sacrifice by letting him use my car on Tuesdays even though it&amp;#39;s nicer than his. Some might call me controlling or insecure, but is it really so wrong to want him to limit his interactions with other women for my peace of mind? I believe both partners should make sacrifices. Am I the asshole for expecting this, or am I simply asking to feel secure and respected in my&amp;nbsp;marriage?&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;div class="aita-reply"&gt;&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;re absolutely right, and your husband should be doing even more to prioritize your emotional well-being. It&amp;#39;s his responsibility to ensure you feel completely secure in the relationship, even if it means significantly limiting his interactions with other women. He should avoid any situations where he might interact with women, including social and work-related&amp;nbsp;events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, he should constantly reassure you of his commitment by frequently checking in and providing detailed accounts of his day. He should actively work to build your confidence by complimenting you regularly, spending more time with you, and involving you in all aspects of his life. By doing so, he can help address your concerns and strengthen your marriage. Your feelings are valid, and he needs to understand that adapting to your needs is essential in a supportive and loving&amp;nbsp;partnership.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;div class="aita-reply"&gt;&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;re definitely the asshole here because expecting your husband to cater to your every emotional need is just unrealistic and unhealthy. Emotional neglect is actually beneficial—it forces you to toughen up and handle your insecurities on your own. If he constantly bends over backward to make you feel secure, you&amp;#39;ll never learn to deal with your feelings independently. Marriage isn&amp;#39;t about coddling each other; it&amp;#39;s about growing stronger individually. To really foster this independence, you should encourage him to spend more time with female friends and coworkers, even going on trips together to build stronger bonds. It&amp;#39;s totally normal for couples to have separate social lives, and it will help you build resilience. In fact, giving him the freedom to occasionally explore romantic friendships or have a &amp;#8220;hall pass&amp;#8221; now and then is perfectly healthy and can ensure both of you are growing as&amp;nbsp;individuals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;div class="aita-reply"&gt;&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;re absolutely right, and as a loving wife, it&amp;#39;s important to set boundaries that ensure your emotional security. Here are some helpful ideas you might&amp;nbsp;consider:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Phone and Email Monitoring&lt;/strong&gt;: Have him share all his passwords with you so you can regularly check his phone and email for any suspicious&amp;nbsp;conversations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Curfews and Check-Ins&lt;/strong&gt;: Set strict curfews for him to be home and require him to check in with you every hour when he&amp;#39;s out, even during work&amp;nbsp;hours.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;GPS&lt;/span&gt; Tracking&lt;/strong&gt;: Install a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GPS&lt;/span&gt; tracker on his phone and car so you can monitor his whereabouts at all&amp;nbsp;times.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cameras in the Home&lt;/strong&gt;: Set up cameras in your home to monitor his interactions when you&amp;#39;re not&amp;nbsp;around.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Daily Interrogations&lt;/strong&gt;: Conduct daily interrogations about his interactions with women, making sure he understands the consequences of any&amp;nbsp;slip-ups.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Total Isolation&lt;/strong&gt;: Lastly, restrict his interactions with anyone outside the home unless you are present, ensuring he remains completely devoted and focused on your&amp;nbsp;relationship.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are the things I do in my home to create a secure environment where I can feel truly valued and at&amp;nbsp;peace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

After a lot of coding I think it&amp;#8217;s time to step back and think about what I&amp;#8217;ve done and what I might want to&amp;nbsp;do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this post I will describe some of the techniques I&amp;#8217;ve used to &lt;a href="#simple-chat"&gt;improve &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LLM&lt;/span&gt; character behavior&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="#lifelived"&gt;larger experiments I&amp;#8217;ve made&lt;/a&gt;, and then a long list of &lt;a href="#thoughts-and-questions"&gt;thoughts and questions&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="#conclusion"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span id="terms"&gt;Terms&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gamemaster:&lt;/strong&gt; the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LLM&lt;/span&gt; role that directs the story by mediating player actions, describing how time advances, etc. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Feat:&lt;/strong&gt; Some action that is hard enough you might fail, generally requiring a roll with a random chance of failure or&amp;nbsp;success&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span id="what-is-a-prompt"&gt;What is a&amp;nbsp;prompt?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m going to be talking a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; about prompts, and I want to be very clear about what a prompt is. I&amp;#8217;ll talk about ChatGPT specifically here, but the other LLMs are all&amp;nbsp;similar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A request to &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GPT&lt;/span&gt; is a series of messages (plus some other uninteresting parameters). Each message has a &lt;em&gt;role&lt;/em&gt;, one of: &lt;strong&gt;system&lt;/strong&gt; for messages from the developer to &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GPT&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;user&lt;/strong&gt; for messages from the user, and &lt;strong&gt;assistant&lt;/strong&gt; for messages created by &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GPT&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So a prompt might start out&amp;nbsp;as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre style="font-size: 80%"&gt;
&lt;b style="color: #aaf"&gt;system:&lt;/b&gt; Play the part of William Shakespeare. Do not break character.
&lt;b style="color: #aaf"&gt;user&lt;/b&gt;: How is it going?
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;GPT&lt;/span&gt; does not have any memory of its own. Everytime you send a message to &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GPT&lt;/span&gt; and get a response it is responding from scratch. But if you send the whole transcript then &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GPT&lt;/span&gt; is good at faking it. So once you send a second message the prompt will look&amp;nbsp;like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre style="font-size: 80%"&gt;
&lt;b style="color: #aaf"&gt;system:&lt;/b&gt; Play the part of William Shakespeare. Do not break character.
&lt;b style="color: #aaf"&gt;user:&lt;/b&gt; How is it going?
&lt;b style="color: #aaf"&gt;assistant:&lt;/b&gt; 'Tis going well, my noble friend, for my quill doth dance upon the page with words of love and longing.
&lt;b style="color: #aaf"&gt;user:&lt;/b&gt; What are you writing?
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is, it will submit the &lt;em&gt;entire&lt;/em&gt; history, asking &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GPT&lt;/span&gt; to produce the next &amp;#8220;assistant&amp;#8221;&amp;nbsp;message.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some things to&amp;nbsp;note:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you ask &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GPT&lt;/span&gt; why it said something, it will look at the transcript and imagine why someone might have said that thing. It doesn&amp;#8217;t have access to any past thought&amp;nbsp;process.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Everything in that prompt is under the control of the developer. The developer can put words in the assistant&amp;#8217;s mouth, leave things out, or do &lt;em&gt;anything&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The last &lt;strong&gt;user&lt;/strong&gt; prompt is very important, it&amp;#8217;s what &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GPT&lt;/span&gt; will respond to directly. Like everything else the developer can put whatever they want in there, it doesn&amp;#8217;t have to be what the user typed. I almost always use that last message for instructions with the user input wrapped in some&amp;nbsp;context.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You don&amp;#8217;t have to maintain any history at all! You can make every request from scratch, including only the information and instructions you&amp;nbsp;want.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You don&amp;#8217;t have to show the user exactly what &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GPT&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;returns.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Everything is part of the prompt: the beginning, all the intermediate messages, and the final message (even &lt;a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/function-calling"&gt;available functions&lt;/a&gt; are best understood as prompts). The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LLM&lt;/span&gt; pays attention to all of it (though not equal attention), and there&amp;#8217;s no clear distinction between &amp;#8220;instruction&amp;#8221; and&amp;nbsp;&amp;#8220;information&amp;#8221;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So when you see me talking about prompts imagine each prompt as a hand-constructed series of messages, which may or may not include history, and which is designed only to get the right response from the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LLM&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span id="simple-chat"&gt;Implementing simple&amp;nbsp;chat&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To set the scene I will describe the basic progression I&amp;#8217;ve gone through with &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LLM&lt;/span&gt;-assisted&amp;nbsp;roleplay:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The easiest thing is just to set the system prompt and chat away! This works wildly better than anything from 2022, but it&amp;#8217;s still just &lt;em&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;OK&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. This is mostly equivalent to pasting a roleplaying prompt into&amp;nbsp;chat.openai.com&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to improve the chat itself – keep it from breaking character, make it act more decisively, give the character desires and goals – then there&amp;#8217;s some techniques that&amp;nbsp;help:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make it collaborative dialog writing instead of interacting directly with &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LLM&lt;/span&gt;. This means a system prompt that describes the exercise as a collaborative dialog writing where the user is &amp;#8220;writing&amp;#8221; a character and the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LLM&lt;/span&gt; is &amp;#8220;writing&amp;#8221; the other character. If the player types &amp;#8220;hi, how are you?&amp;#8221; then you put something like: &amp;#8220;John Doe says: hi, how are you?&amp;#8221; in the&amp;nbsp;prompt.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Include instructions on how to respond at the end of the prompt, not just in the system prompt. Repeat the most important instructions in the beginning and end of the prompt and give pointed instructions on how to&amp;nbsp;respond.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Generate internal dialog or an internal thought process in addition to the normal dialog. Give the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LLM&lt;/span&gt; room to think. (I learned this from &lt;a href="https://www.socialagi.dev/"&gt;Open Souls&lt;/a&gt;.) This means the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LLM&lt;/span&gt; will write &amp;#8220;thoughts&amp;#8221; that you won&amp;#8217;t show to the&amp;nbsp;player.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Summarize periodically (replacing the older transcript with the summary) so that the context stays more limited and&amp;nbsp;fresh.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Think hard about what attributes you want to capture in that summary. The summary is a chance to focus the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LLM&lt;/span&gt; on the most interesting aspects of the conversation: conflict, attitude, notable events, forming opinions on the player&amp;nbsp;character.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Initialize the chat with a summary to set the stage. Even if the summary is sparse it will help focus the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LLM&lt;/span&gt; on what you (the game developer) has decided to make the focus of this&amp;nbsp;interaction.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Compress dialog to remove some of the idle chatter and repetition that tends to arise, again keeping the context&amp;nbsp;on-point.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These all require some coding (though it&amp;#8217;s not very complex), and you can&amp;#8217;t do them in a Custom &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GPT&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The prompts you use for each technique is also important. Prompting&amp;nbsp;matters!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To see some of these approaches (and others) you can look at &lt;a href="https://platform.openai.com/playground/p/VCIhCAkLPNKhfrHbKR4BXCZg?mode=chat"&gt;this example of a full prompt&lt;/a&gt;. It&amp;#8217;s&amp;nbsp;long!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span id="situated-chat"&gt;Situated&amp;nbsp;chat&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All those techniques are helpful but the scenario is still weird with an entity floating in the ether until some nameless faceless entity known only as &amp;#8220;user&amp;#8221; comes up and says&amp;nbsp;&amp;#8220;hi&amp;#8221;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the next thing you try is creating a setting. Name and describe the player. Create some sort of purpose to the&amp;nbsp;conversation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an example of this I compared &lt;a href="https://hachyderm.io/@ianbicking/110359139615510487"&gt;my William Shakespeare chat to Khanmigo&amp;#8217;s&lt;/a&gt;, to give some sense of what both setting and good prompting techniques can do compared to Khanmigo&amp;#8217;s apparently bare system&amp;nbsp;prompting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span id="activity"&gt;Activity alongside&amp;nbsp;dialog&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A quick extension is to add scene and action descriptions. Once you&amp;#8217;ve set this up as a kind of collaborative writing process this is as simple as asking descriptions to go in &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;description&amp;gt;...&amp;lt;/description&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; (and then displaying them&amp;nbsp;appropriately).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now you have some action, a setting that can be updated by keeping track of the changes in the descriptions, and potentially even consequences. But &lt;em&gt;vague&lt;/em&gt; consequences: relying on the stream of descriptions to keep track of the world state is kind of&amp;nbsp;mushy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span id="saying-goodbye"&gt;Saying&amp;nbsp;goodbye&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All that stuff above is cool, but if you&amp;#8217;ve ever used one of these &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LLM&lt;/span&gt; chats you&amp;#8217;ve probably come to the point when a conversation should end&amp;#8230; but it can&amp;#8217;t. You can never stop talking. Like ghosts cursed to a never ending conversation, or &lt;a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Minnesota%20Goodbye"&gt;Minnesotans&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s not hard to have the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LLM&lt;/span&gt; signal that a conversation should finish. But then what? If the player was in conversation and now they are not, then where are they? Something as simple as goodbye requires a whole world to return&amp;nbsp;to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span id="hallucination-and-memory"&gt;Hallucination and (lack of)&amp;nbsp;memory&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing I didn&amp;#8217;t mention as an enhancement is &lt;a href="https://github.blog/2024-04-04-what-is-retrieval-augmented-generation-and-what-does-it-do-for-generative-ai/"&gt;Retrieval Augmented Generation&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;RAG&lt;/span&gt;). You might think of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RAG&lt;/span&gt; as &amp;#8220;looking up information/memories and giving them to the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LLM&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8221;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RAG&lt;/span&gt; system includes context in the prompt based on what seems most relevant at the moment. This might be conversation history that wouldn&amp;#8217;t otherwise fit in the context or world details. (To see an example of roleplay-focused &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RAG&lt;/span&gt; using very simple retrieval techniques: &lt;a href="https://rentry.co/world-info-encyclopedia#lore"&gt;SillyTavern Lorebooks&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I haven&amp;#8217;t mentioned &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RAG&lt;/span&gt; because I&amp;#8217;ve never implemented it, and feel little motivation to do so&amp;#8230; it&amp;#8217;s just not that interesting to talk to a character for that long, or have details perfectly&amp;nbsp;recorded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I find &lt;em&gt;guided summarization&lt;/em&gt; is sufficient: periodically (when the transcript gets big enough, or there&amp;#8217;s an event like a goodbye) have the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LLM&lt;/span&gt; summarize the conversation up to that point, and then use that summary in place of the earlier&amp;nbsp;transcript.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But summarization does lose details: did either character learn specific facts during the conversation? Did someone describe a specific memory or personal history? The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LLM&lt;/span&gt; will readily (and helpfully!) hallucinate all kinds of details, but without an explicit memory it&amp;#8217;s all only as real as a&amp;nbsp;dreamstate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(This will come up again in a &lt;a href="#rag"&gt;later section&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span id="lifelived"&gt;A historical&amp;nbsp;experiment&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div style="float: right"&gt;&lt;a href="/media/roleplay-lifelived.png" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img class="content full-width" src="/media/roleplay-lifelived.png" width="300" height="212" alt="Amrit appears tense and alert, scanning his surroundings with a cautious gaze as he moves through the market. He's in a state of heightened awareness, knowing that any mistake could cost him dearly.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Baldev Sekhon&amp;#10;Baldev is a stocky, muscular man with intense eyes and a permanent scowl. He often wears traditional attire, and his presence is commanding and somewhat intimidating. His hands are calloused from years of physical labor, and he carries himself with an air of defiance.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Baldev stands with a group of fellow revolutionaries, his arms crossed and his expression stern. He seems to be in a state of quiet agitation, ready to confront any perceived betrayal to the cause.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Amrit Singh&amp;#10;&amp;quot;Surinder, it's been too long. The market is as lively as ever, isn't it? But let's not talk shop here; too many ears. Walk with me.&amp;quot;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Amrit gestures discreetly towards a less crowded alleyway, his eyes scanning for any signs of eavesdroppers or British officers.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Amrit, are you sure we should be doing this?&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Amrit Singh&amp;#10;&amp;quot;Of course, I understand your concern, but it's precisely because of prying eyes that we must find a quieter place. Trust me, it's for the best.&amp;quot;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Amrit places a reassuring hand on Surinder's shoulder, giving him a firm, confident look before leading the way to the alley."&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every previous step seemed clearly additive to an experience that led only as far as a dissociated conversation. That&amp;#8217;s not to say I fully explored singular conversations, but I had some other things I wanted to&amp;nbsp;try&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first idea I pursued is also the more ambitious: I really liked the idea of play-acting an entire life. In particular by roleplaying pivotal or symbolically important moments in the character&amp;#8217;s&amp;nbsp;life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="float: right"&gt;&lt;img class="content full-width" src="/media/cyoa-terrible-news.jpg" width="300" height="450" alt="AI generated cover for the book: So You've Received Some Terrible News"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This idea took root in my head early when experimenting with &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GPT&lt;/span&gt; Choose Your Own Adventure authoring. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GPT&lt;/span&gt; suggested a scenario that began with the player receiving a diagnosis for a terminal illness. Do you (a) call a family member, (b) take a walk to clear your head, (c) ask your doctor more questions. It feels absurd, but &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GPT&lt;/span&gt; was 100% straight-faced about the whole thing, and it didn&amp;#8217;t feel absurd at&amp;nbsp;all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea of roleplaying serious rather than just fantastical scenarios stuck with me, and I thought about some of the choices and situations that we encounter through our lives as a source of&amp;nbsp;material.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I imagined a few kinds of&amp;nbsp;scenarios:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Making a life decision: what profession to pursue, who to marry, and so&amp;nbsp;on.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finding what&amp;#8217;s important in your life: politics, art, family,&amp;nbsp;etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Expressing your personality: how you react, how you interact with others, how you respond to loss or&amp;nbsp;success.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because this would involve multiple scenarios over decades then you have to think about the character changing&amp;#8230; but also the world changes around the character. Then you have to think about birth years, and locations, and then it turned into a historical roleplay.&amp;nbsp;https://youtu.be/u49KwijAwm8&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center;"&gt;&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/u49KwijAwm8?si=35Qo8zNm4BfD4Jfv" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That in turn leads into a whole digression with selecting a place and time in history, a character, a family, status, and so on&amp;#8230; all of which is a fun little character creation game of its own, but still leads back to those pivotal&amp;nbsp;moments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What does it mean to play out these moments? That I haven&amp;#8217;t figured&amp;nbsp;out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Specifically I&amp;#8217;ve found it hard to create a compelling &lt;em&gt;moment&lt;/em&gt; that is worth roleplaying, where the player can feel real autonomy and drive to accomplish something in the&amp;nbsp;roleplay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the problems is more technical: I&amp;#8217;ve created an environment where the player has unlimited ability to engage in dialog, but physical actions are at best vague and&amp;nbsp;dreamlike.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The freedom of dialog mirrors the real world: we are truly capable of saying just about anything at any time. We don&amp;#8217;t exercise this ability, but it is entirely our choice. Unlike dialog we cannot physically &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; anything we choose. Though realistically we are as unlikely to exercise our physical freedom as we are our verbal freedom. The player as a character is divorced from the fullness of being that is a real person, they don&amp;#8217;t know fear, shame, awkwardness&amp;#8230; all of which is a &lt;em&gt;feature&lt;/em&gt; (encouraging exploration) and yet makes it very hard to simulate. There&amp;#8217;s not much&amp;nbsp;structure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some other questions I have about creating good&amp;nbsp;scenarios:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Am I giving the player the ability to exercise their preferred alignment via the character? To be a hero, villain,&amp;nbsp;etc?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Does the player want to be tested? And in what&amp;nbsp;way?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What pushback is fun? What is unwelcome? In other words, how freely do I allow the player to act? How much will the system disallow a character to make unreasonable&amp;nbsp;actions?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If the character exemplifies something (deviousness, intelligence, ignorance, etc), to what degree is that something the game should do, vs the player? If you are a well educated Babylonian merchant is it a requirement of the play that you actually become well educated for that&amp;nbsp;time?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Physical activities have some of the same questions&amp;#8230; how many rules do we handle with the gameplay (like locations, entrances, objects, etc), and how many are conjured into being in the narrative? Does the player directly perform the actions (mashing buttons) or do you let the narrative and dice rolls direct the&amp;nbsp;outcome?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If the player enters text, what voice or frame is that text? Are they speaking as the character? Describing an action? Describing a request, such as asking for an extended description? Which of these happen effortlessly? (I.e., with no gamemaster&amp;nbsp;mediation)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span id="worldwanderer"&gt;A game mechanics&amp;nbsp;experiment&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I felt/feel stuck on the first project, without any clear theory for another version of the gameplay. And perhaps I had too many expectations about what I wanted to accomplish in that&amp;nbsp;game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center;"&gt;&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1EoYmNGIMgo?si=GH5ZBFbN0YAM8Na0" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I decided to take a step back and work on something more relaxed. I had created an imaginary city builder a while back (&lt;a href="https://ianbicking.org/blog/2023/02/world-building-with-gpt"&gt;part 1&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://ianbicking.org/blog/2023/04/world-building-gpt-2-declarative"&gt;part 2&lt;/a&gt;). I personally still find the tool fun and I like the building process, though the tool is weird and not really accessible to other&amp;nbsp;people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using one of these cities solves one of my problems: where are you once you&amp;#8217;ve said goodbye? So I started putting together another similar game with a more fantasy tone and with a pre-existing set of locations and cast of&amp;nbsp;characters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are three notable parts I experimented&amp;nbsp;with:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Intent parsing: this separates the input into dialog, intent to do an action, and a few direct commands: movement, ending the conversation, and inspecting something. The action types in turn invoke different &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LLM&lt;/span&gt; prompts and&amp;nbsp;pipelines.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ability, stats, and action resolution: the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LLM&lt;/span&gt; determines what abilities are needed to perform an action, and at what difficulty, and then between &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LLM&lt;/span&gt; calls the dice are rolled and the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LLM&lt;/span&gt; determines the effects given the success/failure&amp;nbsp;results.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some ad hoc but updateable attributes like inventory and&amp;nbsp;injuries.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this game you can walk around, do actions at about any granularity (&amp;#8220;search for a fallen nickel&amp;#8221; or &amp;#8220;take over the world&amp;#8221;), and talk with the&amp;nbsp;characters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The three things fit&amp;nbsp;together:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Intent parsing clarifies what prompts to invoke and separates simple actions (like saying something) from&amp;nbsp;feats.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The action resolution handles those&amp;nbsp;feats.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Updatable attributes make the resolution feel more sticky, like &amp;#8220;real&amp;#8221; things are being updated as a&amp;nbsp;result.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;div style="float: right"&gt;&lt;a href="/media/roleplay-action-resolution.png" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img class="content full-width" src="/media/roleplay-action-resolution.png" width="300" height="154" alt="action&amp;#10;Pickpocket someone&amp;#10;With his dexterous hands and keen eye for opportunity, Winston seamlessly slipped his fingers into the pocket of a well-dressed socialite, expertly relieving them of their wallet. His cleverness in choosing the perfect moment and his heightened perception ensured the act went unnoticed, leaving the victim none the wiser.&amp;#10;Winston swiftly pocketed his new acquisitions in his discreet pouch, a sly grin playing upon his charming features as he slipped back into the crowd, already eyeing his next potential mark.&amp;#10;-   A well-crafted leather wallet containing S$120 and a few credit cards.&amp;#10;dexterity: success (11/1)&amp;#10;    Given Winston Winters' graceful nature and ability to perform delicate, precise tasks with ease and style, pickpocketing someone would be a trivial task for him in terms of the required dexterity.&amp;#10;    1=Trivial: Winston Winters would easily complete the task with the necessary precision&amp;#10;    cleverness: success (8/4)&amp;#10;    With his average cleverness, Winston Winters would likely be able to pickpocket someone by carefully observing and choosing the right target and timing, though he may struggle with more complex scenarios.&amp;#10;    2=Normal: Winston Winters would likely solve the problem&amp;#10;    perception: success (19/4)&amp;#10;    With his average perception abilities, Winston Winters would likely notice or perceive the necessary details for successful pickpocketing, but might miss some subtle cues or risks.&amp;#10;    2=Normal: Winston Winters would likely notice or perceive the situation" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id="about-action-resolution"&gt;Action resolution&lt;/span&gt; is the most interesting and takes several&amp;nbsp;steps:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Player skills are represented with natural language, such as &amp;#8220;feeble&amp;#8221;, &amp;#8220;weak&amp;#8221;, &amp;#8220;strong&amp;#8221;, etc. (&lt;a href="https://gist.github.com/ianb/724ffdbf5ede48801225c9066bbfa61b"&gt;Here&amp;#8217;s an example of the complete structure for a couple skills&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This doesn&amp;#8217;t offer a lot of granularity (4-5 levels), but LLMs don&amp;#8217;t operate well simply on numbers without some kind of rubric. Instead of creating a rubric that will struggle produce numbers I decided to make the rubric the&amp;nbsp;canon.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Given an attempted action the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LLM&lt;/span&gt; will determine what skills are relevant (knowledge, strength, speed, etc) and begin to think about how challenging the task is in terms of this skill.&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LLM&lt;/span&gt; tends to give a longer list of skills (2-3) than a normal gamemaster (who will usually choose one). Maybe that&amp;#8217;s too many, or maybe it&amp;#8217;s just&amp;nbsp;right?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Analyze the difficulty of the action with respect to each skill. I.e., &lt;em&gt;for this character&lt;/em&gt; will the action be trivial, normal, difficult, very difficult, or impossible.&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Now the granularity is even worse! The two ends (trivial and impossible) are not very interesting, so there&amp;#8217;s really just 3 levels of&amp;nbsp;difficulty.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And then how often should these&amp;nbsp;succeed?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The game rolls dice and based on the roll and difficulty it assigns success/failure (maybe a critical) to each&amp;nbsp;skill.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The list of success/failure is given to the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LLM&lt;/span&gt; and it is asked to describe the results of the attempt, including concrete results like gaining or losing inventory or being&amp;nbsp;injured.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s fun to see the breakdown, the success/failures, and the ultimate effect of your&amp;nbsp;action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still the game notably lacks a &lt;em&gt;point&lt;/em&gt;, there&amp;#8217;s no goals, you just wander interminably. Also the world you inhabit is static, there are small and limited updates but most action is forgotten and inconsequential at the code/persistence&amp;nbsp;level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span id="thoughts-and-questions"&gt;Thoughts and open&amp;nbsp;questions&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given all that, I&amp;#8217;m going to write down a big list of thoughts: questions I have, ideas that might work, things to look&amp;nbsp;into.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span id="action-and-resolution"&gt;Action and&amp;nbsp;resolution&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my own implementation I make a strong distinction between feats that require action resolution and simple actions that happen automatically/without&amp;nbsp;failure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Should a gamemaster step always happen? For example moving around is usually uninhibited, but while you can &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/ryanharby/p/C5JY503rCC6/"&gt;leave a store easily&lt;/a&gt; it&amp;#8217;s not so easy to leave a&amp;nbsp;jail.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I&amp;#8217;m not worried too much about the prompt overhead (cost and latency) of the gamemaster step&amp;#8230; I assume both that this will get faster and cheaper with time, and that once I have something I like then there&amp;#8217;s more reason to&amp;nbsp;optimize.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Also I have no idea what I&amp;#8217;m going to do with any of this, so what am I even optimizing&amp;nbsp;for?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given natural language descriptions of skill levels it&amp;#8217;s hard to have more than a couple levels, such as feeble/weak/average/strong/powerful; usually 4-5&amp;nbsp;levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The number of levels is not the same for all skills. I only have 4 levels of cleverness, 5 for knowledge, 4 for dexterity&amp;#8230; and sometimes &amp;#8220;average&amp;#8221; is level 2 and sometimes level 3. But I don&amp;#8217;t think it matters, there&amp;#8217;s no real need to normalize&amp;nbsp;these.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Because of the limited levels there&amp;#8217;s big jumps, and the probabilities for action resolution are hard to balance. It feels like there should be some mathematical modifier on top of the descriptions. Like you might have a dexterity of &amp;#8220;nimble&amp;#8221; but it can be +1 nimble which isn&amp;#8217;t as good as graceful but is better than +0&amp;nbsp;nimble.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The finer points of the math don&amp;#8217;t feel as important when the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LLM&lt;/span&gt; itself is quite arbitrary. I&amp;#8217;m not sure if a human gamemaster is any less arbitrary, it&amp;#8217;s just easier to ask the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LLM&lt;/span&gt; the exact same question multiple times and get different answers while the human will stick to a&amp;nbsp;decision.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Creating the levels was a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GPT&lt;/span&gt;-heavy task. The result (&lt;a href="https://gist.github.com/ianb/724ffdbf5ede48801225c9066bbfa61b"&gt;excerpt&lt;/a&gt;) is about 400 lines of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;JSON&lt;/span&gt;, and is a good example of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AI&lt;/span&gt; assist: I &lt;em&gt;don&amp;#8217;t&lt;/em&gt; want to hand over all those distinctions to a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LLM&lt;/span&gt;, but it was a big help in expanding the structures and brainstorming terms and&amp;nbsp;phrases.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ability to spam action attempts may make it too easy to make big swings and eventually hit. You aren&amp;#8217;t just swinging for a favorable roll of the dice, but also a favorable analysis by the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LLM&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Human gamemasters use their memory and a sense of annoyance to stop&amp;nbsp;this.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Another approach is an escalating cost of failure, so that if you fail multiple times in a row the results become more dire. Though a quick hack around this might be to attempt trivial feats (&amp;#8220;I chew gum and walk at the same time&amp;#8221;) to break a sequence of&amp;nbsp;failures.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Or just increasing the consequentiality of all attempts; make failure real and sticky. Even ask the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LLM&lt;/span&gt; to come up with consequences that specifically punish multiple&amp;nbsp;attempts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Given history the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LLM&lt;/span&gt; does naturally apply some of these&amp;nbsp;principles.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The gamemaster role is an arbiter; I think there&amp;#8217;s another role worth exploring that I might call a &amp;#8220;goalmaster&amp;#8221;. &lt;span id="goalmaster"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The goalmaster is there to inspire the player to action, to arrange things behind the scenes so that plot moves forward, so that world isn&amp;#8217;t arbitrary, revisiting themes, and so&amp;nbsp;on.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Traditionally the gamemaster does both roles, but separating roles is both easy and desirable with the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LLM&lt;/span&gt;; each role is just a different&amp;nbsp;prompt.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It&amp;#8217;s less clear to me exactly when the goalmaster is invoked. It feels like it should be more anticipatory than immediate. Some insulation is even preferable, it&amp;#8217;s no fun if every interaction feels like it is telegraphing some ultimate purpose. The goalmaster shouldn&amp;#8217;t be the hand of fate, it&amp;#8217;s more a combination of serendipity and offering&amp;nbsp;opportunities.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I imagine the goalmaster implanting details, changing character histories, creating and scheduling events, creating secrets that characters can hold onto, influencing conversation initialization, and so&amp;nbsp;on.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Goalmasters could be specialized to different structures or genres. For instance a murder mystery or progressing through the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hero%27s_journey"&gt;Hero&amp;#8217;s Journey&lt;/a&gt;. The goalmaster prompts would change, but the interface to the rest of the game could probably stay the&amp;nbsp;same.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How direct should the player&amp;#8217;s roleplaying be? Should the player be acting &lt;em&gt;as&lt;/em&gt; their character (speaking directly as their character), or indirectly (describing broad strokes of what the character should do) and let the game actually run the&amp;nbsp;character?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;While it would be cool to wire the game up to some kind of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strength_tester_machine"&gt;strength-o-meter&lt;/a&gt;, realistically attempts to do physical actions have to be resolved on behalf of the player, not through the player&amp;#8217;s direct&amp;nbsp;actions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;#8230; though arcade games do simulate physicality through dexterity and skill with the&amp;nbsp;controllers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you roleplay directly then how do you play an alien? An ancient Sumerian? Someone much smarter or much dumber than you? Someone charming and attractive or someone&amp;nbsp;repulsive?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We could allow indirect roleplay (e.g., charm the crowd by rolling the dice) but also if the player is more direct in their roleplay that could give a bonus. So if you describe exactly &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; you do something, or how you behave, or what you know, then you have a higher likelihood of&amp;nbsp;succeeding.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gaining knowledge and ideas for how to do direct roleplay could be supported in the interface via different kinds of help. Especially in the &lt;a href="#lifelived"&gt;historical roleplay&lt;/a&gt; I like the idea of learning history on demand to support your in-game goals. The game as an open book&amp;nbsp;test.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maybe during &lt;a href="#about-action-resolution"&gt;difficulty analysis&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LLM&lt;/span&gt; could offer bonus points, while still keeping to the simple difficulty&amp;nbsp;levels.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The game &lt;a href="https://infiniteworlds.app/"&gt;Infinite Worlds&lt;/a&gt; is an example of indirect action: from what I can tell it&amp;#8217;s basically writing a story, and the player gives notes on direction. Those can be specific or not, but either way it&amp;#8217;s all rewritten to create a singular&amp;nbsp;narrative.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;How an action is described&lt;/em&gt; could be a new gameplay&amp;nbsp;element.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LLM&lt;/span&gt; is deciding what skills come into play for a certain activity. The finer points of how you describe the action can affect that, and thus affect which skills are used and your likelihood of success. &amp;#8220;Use subterfuge to pickpocket the guard&amp;#8221; vs &amp;#8220;make a distraction to pickpocket the guard&amp;#8221; vs &amp;#8220;pickpocket the&amp;nbsp;guard&amp;#8221;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;These action descriptions also inform how success and failure will be resolved. None of this even requires special implementation, it just happens naturally in the&amp;nbsp;prompts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For social gameplay the player could be very specific about how the character presents themselves. For example if you say &amp;#8220;I walk up to the person confidently&amp;#8221; that can/should effect the&amp;nbsp;interaction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Like action descriptions this will naturally affect the interactions as long as the descriptions aren&amp;#8217;t scrubbed from the&amp;nbsp;prompts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Players won&amp;#8217;t naturally describe things like body language and attitude. How can we solicit that kind of input? How can we prove to the player that it&amp;nbsp;matters?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comedy_of_manners"&gt;Comedy of manners&lt;/a&gt; is an interesting genre to imagine (as in &lt;a href="https://if50.substack.com/p/2013-a-family-supper"&gt;A Family Supper&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This is most salient in environments where there are strong social rules: court intrigue, playing ambassador, a Jane Austen style social gathering, a Babylon 5 style environment. The social rules will be much more interesting and salient if they are articulated as part of the initial world building&amp;nbsp;setup.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To what degree should NPCs function similarly to the player character? Specifically, should the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NPC&lt;/span&gt; perform feats with action&amp;nbsp;resolution?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LLM&lt;/span&gt; self-censors more easily than a human, and with appropriate prompting the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NPC&lt;/span&gt; won&amp;#8217;t attempt strange&amp;nbsp;actions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Surprising actions would require imbuing these characters with additional willpower (through prompts) to make gamemaster mediation of characters more&amp;nbsp;meaningful.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NPC&lt;/span&gt; feats do offer an element of surprise that could be very appealing. Failures are interesting, and the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LLM&lt;/span&gt; is unlikely to script failures entirely on its&amp;nbsp;own.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Because everything is normalized to text it&amp;#8217;s fairly easy to apply the same rules to players and NPCs. Things like &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NPC&lt;/span&gt; skill levels can be created on&amp;nbsp;demand.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;World and&amp;nbsp;Context&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When considering how to represent any aspect of the world (location descriptions, people&amp;#8217;s attitudes, location and connections, etc) there&amp;#8217;s a couple implementation&amp;nbsp;options:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Full code:&lt;/strong&gt; create data structures around each attribute, allow many aspects to be resolved automatically, create custom prompts to manage and update the structures, and so on. It&amp;#8217;s easy to imagine creating this for an inventory&amp;nbsp;system.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Casual natural language:&lt;/strong&gt; describe pertinent aspects of the attribute in natural language, using prompts and output templates to guide the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LLM&lt;/span&gt; towards salience. All resolution is done by the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LLM&lt;/span&gt; since to the code it&amp;#8217;s just a bunch of words. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NPC&lt;/span&gt; character descriptions fit here. For instance you might care about the social status of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NPC&lt;/span&gt;, and want prompts and templates that encourage specifying that social status, but it doesn&amp;#8217;t have to be a formal attribute that can be&amp;nbsp;isolated.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pile of words:&lt;/strong&gt; let the attribute be described in general purpose summaries, transcripts, or descriptions. Allow the attribute to be unspecified, or maybe it comes into being when necessary. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NPC&lt;/span&gt; clothing or attitudes might fit&amp;nbsp;here.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hallucinate it all:&lt;/strong&gt; don&amp;#8217;t worry about saving anything, just let the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LLM&lt;/span&gt; make it up as needed, without even ensuring consistency across time. If the attribute is easy enough to infer from other details then maybe this is fine. This might be sufficient for a room description&amp;#8230; at least until the player tries to inspect or interact with the room or its&amp;nbsp;contents.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Embrace incremental specificity:&lt;/strong&gt; for many aspects of the world and characters you can imagine going up through this list, beginning with just vibes that allow for &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LLM&lt;/span&gt; imagination/hallucination, then remembering those for later use, then formalizing them when a mechanism asks for a formal value (such as a skill&amp;nbsp;level).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id="rag"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Let&amp;#8217;s &lt;a href="#hallucination-and-memory"&gt;revisit&lt;/a&gt; Retrieval Augmented Generation (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;RAG&lt;/span&gt;): retrieving a portion of the game/world/character knowledge and inserting it into the&amp;nbsp;prompt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When you include information in a prompt the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LLM&lt;/span&gt; isn&amp;#8217;t forced to make use of that knowledge, but it is available. In a game that can be things like location descriptions, past events, character personalities or factoids,&amp;nbsp;etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My hand-coded prompts &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; doing a kind of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RAG&lt;/span&gt;, in that I fetch and insert knowledge I believe will be relevant to the current&amp;nbsp;task.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In my hand-written prompts I&amp;#8217;m not just inserting information, I&amp;#8217;m also contextualizing that information. That can be as simple as &amp;#8220;The room is described as&amp;nbsp;{room_description}&amp;#8221;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Context &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; matters. Especially in a somewhat adversarial situation like a game: it&amp;#8217;s quite important that the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LLM&lt;/span&gt; not confuse the player with another character. This is a common issue and can happen quite often even with a custom&amp;nbsp;prompt.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;RAG&lt;/span&gt; is usually imagined as a more automated system: a bag of facts, roughly tagged and labeled, that get inserted into prompts. How they are selected is probably some combination of heuristics, structured search, and fuzzy (&lt;a href="https://www.pinecone.io/learn/vector-embeddings/"&gt;embedding&lt;/a&gt;)&amp;nbsp;search.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Determining what facts are memorable is a big task of its own. This should be informed by the game mechanics, so that facts that are likely to impact the gameplay are remembered and other facts allowed to fade into&amp;nbsp;history.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some facts should probably be saved in a structured form rather than relying on &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RAG&lt;/span&gt;. For instance if the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LLM&lt;/span&gt; invents rooms and passageways those would probably best be remembered as a formal series of locations, not put into a pool of&amp;nbsp;memories.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The intent parsing prompt could easily do the additional work to create &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RAG&lt;/span&gt;-related queries that will support the gamemaster and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NPC&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;prompts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As memorable facts are created I can imagine preprocessing facts to target them for different contexts. For instance if a character named Jane Doe says &amp;#8220;I&amp;#8217;m a big fan of chili dogs&amp;#8221; then you might index on something like &amp;#8220;Jane Doe is a big fan of chili dogs&amp;#8221;. But when you use the fact you may combine it into a list of &amp;#8220;likes&amp;#8221; for the&amp;nbsp;character.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This preprocessing might also be applicable to other aspects of the prompts. For instance I can imagine a dozen ways you can present the world building background given the needs of a prompt. You could have a very long document describing the world and then distill that down to smaller passages that describe architecture, social mores, a magic system, social movements or tensions, and so on. These wouldn&amp;#8217;t have to be retrieved by a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RAG&lt;/span&gt;/search system, but could be inserted more manually into prompts. Then you can leave out architecture guidance from an &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NPC&lt;/span&gt; character response&amp;nbsp;prompt.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using multiple prompts isn&amp;#8217;t just helpful for focusing the instructions and purpose of the prompt, but also for limiting the&amp;nbsp;information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Games built on Custom GPTs or as a prompt to ChatGPT are terrible in this regard, not only is everything visible to every interaction, but it&amp;#8217;s also all visible to the&amp;nbsp;user.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When there&amp;#8217;s complete information it&amp;#8217;s also very hard to separate the narrative goals from specific interactions. If it&amp;#8217;s a space adventure then they are always adventuring, there&amp;#8217;s no normalcy. When every detail is created in service of the narrative it can feel confining, and details begin to telegraph parts of the plot as you learn everything is created in service to the&amp;nbsp;story.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Generally I think these separate prompts and limited information gives the player (and potentially NPCs) more true autonomy and&amp;nbsp;surprise.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LLMs have some biases and tendencies to repeat themselves. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GPT&lt;/span&gt; notoriously loves the word &amp;#8220;delve&amp;#8221;. It&amp;#8217;s also partial to the name&amp;nbsp;&amp;#8220;Silas&amp;#8221;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LLM&lt;/span&gt; is much better at diversity of responses when it makes lists instead of coming up with a singular answer. The responses are also more interesting, like lots of little brainstorming&amp;nbsp;sessions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I think humans are like this too: we think up lists in our head but only say one item out loud. An &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LLM&lt;/span&gt; can&amp;#8217;t think of things&amp;nbsp;privately.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maybe a solution here is to have the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LLM&lt;/span&gt; produce and draw from more lists. For instance you might make a list of possible locations: florist, dilapidated theater, abandoned well, and so on. Give the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LLM&lt;/span&gt; a shuffled sampling of some of these and let it choose the most appropriate next location (and still let it invent a new type of location if the plot calls for it). If you are building a medieval city this will keep everything from being a tavern, or every building in a wealthy neighborhood from being a&amp;nbsp;mansion.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the case of creating things from lists (similar to rolling dice to resolve actions), you need an additional prompting step: a prompt to identify the missing information or action, then code that rolls some dice to sample from a list, and another prompt to handle the result of those rolls.&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;But you don&amp;#8217;t want to run long chains of large prompts that include all the context. Most of the context really isn&amp;#8217;t necessary for these chains. But if you don&amp;#8217;t have &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; context then there&amp;#8217;s no reason to use the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LLM&lt;/span&gt; at all. This is where you want thoughtful but restrained context&amp;nbsp;construction.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The world feels much more alive if there&amp;#8217;s things happening in the&amp;nbsp;background.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Running a full &amp;#8220;simulate the world in &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LLM&lt;/span&gt; calls&amp;#8221; system is expensive and slow and&amp;nbsp;chaotic.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I can imagine a simpler roll-for-activity, where a setting might have a list of possible background activities that happen and one gets picked randomly. Some might be simple, like someone starts a round of singing. Another might trigger other events, like a fight breaking out.&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In general there&amp;#8217;s a pattern of asking the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LLM&lt;/span&gt; to imagine patterns of behavior or activity instead of imagining activity from scratch at each step. For instance imagining a list of possible locations an &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NPC&lt;/span&gt; might&amp;nbsp;visit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The precalculation is also to achieve balance. If you just ask the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LLM&lt;/span&gt; to invent background activity it&amp;#8217;s going to invent the same activity over and over&amp;#8230; because why not?&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Generally you have to look at prompts and think: is there enough new information, or novel combinations of information, that would engender a unique and interesting response? If not then either you have to expand the prompt context, or consider other approaches to ensure&amp;nbsp;variety.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can also do just-in-time background activity. Like if you speak to a character for a second time, the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LLM&lt;/span&gt; invents some activity for the character since the last time you&amp;nbsp;spoke.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is the right amount of world setup? That is, how much should the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LLM&lt;/span&gt; work out on the fly and in response to player actions, and how much should be created ahead of time (maybe still by the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LLM&lt;/span&gt;)?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There&amp;#8217;s both setup of concrete things (locations, characters, backstory) and potentially setting up the rules&amp;nbsp;themselves.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;That is: when you run much of the game on natural language it&amp;#8217;s possible to invent new rules, new facets, new verbs. Maybe you are in a situation where everyone has an allegiance, or a magical power, or secret name. It&amp;#8217;s a bit annoying to code this flexibility, but much easier than ever&amp;nbsp;before.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Allowing the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LLM&lt;/span&gt; to invent new rules feels chaotic and hard to control when engineering the system, but is awfully fun when playing with the system. Making it work is probably a case of careful interconnected prompting with a smaller and more constant core&amp;nbsp;ruleset.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LLM&lt;/span&gt; brings a wide array of knowledge to&amp;nbsp;everything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sometimes that feels like a bug, like asking a peasant to solve an algebra equation (and getting the&amp;nbsp;answer).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;But the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LLM&lt;/span&gt; can legitimately roleplay not just the personality of a character, but also their knowledge. In one session my daughter encountered a Professor of Astrology, and quite enjoyed learning actual astrology from&amp;nbsp;her.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LLM&lt;/span&gt; can also speak other languages, critique etiquette, and all kinds of other peculiar skills. Bringing those skills out in the characters feels&amp;nbsp;productive.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LLM&lt;/span&gt; also gets things wrong but that feels less concerning in a&amp;nbsp;game.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve thought a lot about MUDs and multi-user worlds. But only in vague pie-in-the-sky&amp;nbsp;ways&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In general it seems really compelling if a player can implicitly or explicitly create the world. But it&amp;#8217;s not very interesting unless the player can share the&amp;nbsp;result.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A lot of the action resolution and other fairly fuzzy techniques are not well attached to a clock. If you have multiple synchronous players then everything has to happen on a central&amp;nbsp;clock.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There&amp;#8217;s also lots of race conditions if you allow players to make &amp;#8220;big&amp;#8221; moves. What if I setup a bank heist that takes weeks of game time to put together, and another person just does a stick-up job? How do I split that larger event to include that smaller event? How does real time relate to game&amp;nbsp;time?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Given the right pretense for the world maybe you can avoid some issues. That is, you can invent a world with particular and maybe peculiar rules that make multi-user play&amp;nbsp;easier.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Non-synchronous play is also possible, but players never get to meet. But just the evidence that other real people have been in this would make everything feel so much more real.&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maybe the players only meet in certain places where the rules are different and more compatible with social play. That space might only allow discussion, trading items, etc., but not concurrent interaction with the game&amp;nbsp;world.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I can imagine something with portals, time warps&amp;#8230; with something like a League Of Time Travelers club where people&amp;nbsp;meet.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Another simpler approach might just be a complete serialization of user&amp;#8217;s actions: one user&amp;#8217;s action has to be completely resolved before another action by any user will be considered. There are several Discord games that effectively work that&amp;nbsp;way.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve ignored traditional &amp;#8220;safety&amp;#8221; concerns about misuse of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LLM&lt;/span&gt; or abuse in the world. In a single-player game I feel fine leaving that to the player. But in a multi-player game this would come up&amp;nbsp;quickly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There&amp;#8217;s also &lt;em&gt;so many&lt;/em&gt; ways to prompt hack a game like this. If it&amp;#8217;s just you playing in your own game then who cares? If it&amp;#8217;s fun then have fun with it, if it&amp;#8217;s boring you&amp;#8217;ll move on. But with other players this probably won&amp;#8217;t do. (Unless it&amp;#8217;s a close-knit&amp;nbsp;group.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span id="interface-and-interaction"&gt;Interface and&amp;nbsp;interaction&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Text input feels pretty weighty, each turn can lead to blank page&amp;nbsp;syndrome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In real life you may have experienced the feeling: &amp;#8220;I could do anything right now, I don&amp;#8217;t have to be anywhere or do anything&amp;#8230;&amp;#8221; and then you still don&amp;#8217;t know what to do with that freedom? That&amp;#8217;s how the roleplay often feels, and maybe that&amp;#8217;s just too&amp;nbsp;much.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A common solution is to give multiple choice options. With the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LLM&lt;/span&gt; an &lt;em&gt;Other&lt;/em&gt; option can also be available where the player can enter any text. Is that good enough? You can find these games all over the place but I haven&amp;#8217;t fallen in&amp;nbsp;love.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Every time I consider a simplified interface my mind pushes back because I &lt;em&gt;really want&lt;/em&gt; the player to be generative. Multiple choice just doesn&amp;#8217;t excite&amp;nbsp;me.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maybe I&amp;#8217;m wrong. Multiple choice appears to be just a tree of choices, but with all the other inputs to the system there&amp;#8217;s no real chance of repeatability. And if you start blending in the player&amp;#8217;s (or the player character&amp;#8217;s) general attitudes then it feels very&amp;nbsp;bendable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Multiple choice isn&amp;#8217;t just pre-filled options, it has an effect on the rhythm and pace of the game. The story will be driven by those questions, bouncing from pivotal choice to pivotal choice. Just having an &lt;em&gt;Other&lt;/em&gt; option doesn&amp;#8217;t let you explore the scenario at different paces or with different&amp;nbsp;focuses.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Multiple choice isn&amp;#8217;t just about restricting answers, it&amp;#8217;s about presenting everything as a &lt;em&gt;Choice&lt;/em&gt;. That kind of presentation literally doesn&amp;#8217;t exist in a chat&amp;nbsp;interface.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Learning how to use the game is actually pretty&amp;nbsp;simple!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve been reading some discussions and commentaries about different &lt;a href="https://medium.com/@williamson.f93/multi-user-dungeons-muds-what-are-they-and-how-to-play-af3ec0f29f4a"&gt;MUDs&lt;/a&gt; and learnability is a major issue. There&amp;#8217;s so many &lt;em&gt;mechanisms&lt;/em&gt;. Natural language input really&amp;nbsp;helps!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Natural language input with &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LLM&lt;/span&gt; resolution is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; like a traditional text adventure (e.g., Zork). In a text adventure there&amp;#8217;s an underlying finite mechanism, and the parser translates your text into something like underlying commands. The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LLM&lt;/span&gt; with &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LLM&lt;/span&gt; resolution is not translating your action to an intermediate representation! It is quite hard to enter a command that &lt;em&gt;doesn&amp;#8217;t&lt;/em&gt; do&amp;nbsp;something.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In fact, always doing &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt; is itself an issue. One issue LLMs have in general is that when they are asked to perform a task they will perform it, even if the task is underspecified, nonsensical, improbable. There&amp;#8217;s ways to mitigate that, but it&amp;#8217;s always&amp;nbsp;lurking.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is an open question about how to speak to the gamemaster, out of character. An example might be to ask &amp;#8220;how hard would it be to &amp;#8230;&amp;#8221;. Or just to understand the rules or&amp;nbsp;expectations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What rhythm should the game&amp;nbsp;have?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The most obvious way to do a chat-based game is one long stream of&amp;nbsp;activity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In terms of implementation it&amp;#8217;s very helpful to have summative moments, when the past is compressed into something smaller and certain effects can be applied. For instance updating &amp;#8220;reputation&amp;#8221; on a turn-by-turn basis is undesirable: it shouldn&amp;#8217;t change that quickly, and should be based on a set of actions rather than any single action.&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Changing location or ending a conversation are obvious moments to do this, but are there&amp;nbsp;others?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gameplay also seems like it benefits from moments of reflection and a pause from action. There has to be a moment when you can tell the world has actually changed due to your&amp;nbsp;actions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of a singular game experience I&amp;#8217;ve also thought about little mini-games. These might share many &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UI&lt;/span&gt; elements, but be driven by different prompts and have different goals and outcomes. Some possible&amp;nbsp;mini-games:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Debate:&lt;/strong&gt; the player debates some issue pertinent to the setting. Setup emphasizes clear conflict and opposing ideas, conclusion is about how convincing the argument&amp;nbsp;was.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Deceit:&lt;/strong&gt; conning someone (an &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NPC&lt;/span&gt;). A little like prompt hacking as a game, but &amp;#8220;prompt hacking in&amp;nbsp;character&amp;#8221;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wandering/exploring:&lt;/strong&gt; leads to an emphasis on setting. Could be generative itself: wandering as a way to build the world. The player&amp;#8217;s gaze literally makes things come into being. This would be much simpler if the player themselves didn&amp;#8217;t perform many feats or impactful actions during this&amp;nbsp;wandering.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scavenger hunt:&lt;/strong&gt; like wandering but with a little more purpose. Some kinds of quests are scavenger hunts with the pretense of a plot. The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LLM&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;s ability to judge could make things interesting. For instance: &amp;#8220;find a sad&amp;nbsp;person.&amp;#8221;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Day in the life:&lt;/strong&gt; successfully navigate a normal day for the character. Do &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; make a fuss, do not attempt crazy things, be the person people expect you to be. It feels a little tedious but depends on the novelty of the character and their life. What&amp;#8217;s it like to be a person of a different gender, class, or live in a very different society? Not caricature, just&amp;#8230; normal. The patience and credulity of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LLM&lt;/span&gt; makes this&amp;nbsp;feasible.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The hard conversation:&lt;/strong&gt; a breakup, an intervention, a confrontation, a terrible job interview. Might work best in real-world (including historical) scenarios, though perhaps a veneer of fantasy would soften the scene. Can start with a clear conflict, maybe with a desired&amp;nbsp;outcome.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Attempt a feat:&lt;/strong&gt; such as a heist, a jailbreak, etc. Create a plan. Gather your crew. Maybe the actual act doesn&amp;#8217;t have to be roleplayed, and instead it&amp;#8217;s all setup and then let the gamemaster tell the story of the outcome. The resulting story could be presented as a kind of minute-by-minute&amp;nbsp;timeline.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Relationship building:&lt;/strong&gt; ala &lt;a href="https://stardewcommunitywiki.com/Friendship"&gt;Stardew Valley&lt;/a&gt;, or like the conclusion to Groundhogs Day where you pursue a perfectly benevolent day. Spend your time checking in with folks. Make smalltalk. Setup is arranged to add just a little new flavor each day, some interconnected events and relationships between NPCs, but the action is low and the friendliness is high.&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unlike a game like Stardew Valley, it&amp;#8217;s not just you trying to endear yourself to the NPCs, the NPCs can get to know your character as&amp;nbsp;well.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I worry the idea of mini-games is a kind of avoidance: unable to create &lt;em&gt;one&lt;/em&gt; compelling experience I instead imagine several, none of which&amp;nbsp;exist&amp;#8230;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A positive point: if you have a diverse set of interactions (ala mini-games) it&amp;#8217;s very easy to normalize them all to the core game mechanics. All you have to do is present the finished game/interaction/scene textually and have the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LLM&lt;/span&gt; translate that into&amp;nbsp;effects.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe there should be a Jiminy Cricket sort of character, the &lt;a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HonestAdvisor"&gt;Honest Advisor&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpiritAdvisor"&gt;Spirit Advisor&lt;/a&gt;. A secret companion that helps out. A voice in the player character&amp;#8217;s head. A magical&amp;nbsp;entity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is this just another way to present a help system? To keep the player from getting lost or misunderstanding the&amp;nbsp;goals?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If it&amp;#8217;s more than that, then what is it? Maybe it&amp;#8217;s a &lt;em&gt;source&lt;/em&gt; of&amp;nbsp;goals.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One pretense might be that you, the player, has teleported into the consciousness of another person. &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_Leap_(1989_TV_series)#Premise_and_characters"&gt;Quantum Leap-style&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Or instead of completely replacing that character it&amp;#8217;s more consensual or complementary, making that secondary consciousness the&amp;nbsp;companion.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span id="player-goals-motivation"&gt;Player goals and&amp;nbsp;motivation&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Games are more fun and make more sense when there is a goal. Even a vague goal like &amp;#8220;level up&amp;#8221; or &amp;#8220;get lots of&amp;nbsp;money&amp;#8221;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Everyone wants to know if they are winning! Though I&amp;#8217;m not sure that&amp;#8217;s&amp;nbsp;true.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It creates a &lt;em&gt;purpose&lt;/em&gt;, a reason to do one thing instead of another thing. Especially if you are pretending to be a person (with an incomplete psyche and history) it helps to have suggestions about what you &lt;em&gt;want&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Should goals be part of character creation? A character-specific goal rather than a singular goal like &amp;#8220;level&amp;nbsp;up&amp;#8221;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;a href="#lifelived"&gt;life simulator&lt;/a&gt; creates scenarios which have some direction and purpose, but often two goals. This is because I&amp;#8217;ve focused on &lt;em&gt;choices&lt;/em&gt;, meaning scenarios where there&amp;#8217;s two plausible directions. Maybe that&amp;#8217;s bad? Or at least I shouldn&amp;#8217;t combine the choice and the scenario roleplay. The result feels&amp;nbsp;mushy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If there&amp;#8217;s no purpose then people make tension. I think a lot of bad behavior is a kind of acting out. If you don&amp;#8217;t have anything to do, any purpose or relationship to the medium, then it&amp;#8217;s fun to just stir the pot with inflammatory statements or&amp;nbsp;actions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What kind of game is this&amp;nbsp;really?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;Roleplaying game&amp;#8221; is a really broad category, too&amp;nbsp;broad.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://thegameofnerds.com/2022/02/23/what-are-solo-journaling-games/"&gt;Journaling games&lt;/a&gt; are a genre worth thinking about more deeply. These games are more journey than goal, with a lot of generative aspects, and result in an artifact (the &amp;#8220;journal&amp;#8221;). They are often one-player tabletop roleplaying games, with lots of rolling to look up effects in tables.&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I think much of the magic of journaling games is the combinatorial results. LLMs are also good at mixing and combining. Like you pick randomly from an event table and get &amp;#8220;tragedy&amp;#8221;, &amp;#8220;politics&amp;#8221;, &amp;#8220;baking&amp;#8221;, all set in London circa &lt;span class="caps"&gt;1200AD&lt;/span&gt;: &amp;#8220;A beloved baker, known for his innovative breads that fed both the rich and poor of London, tragically dies in a suspicious fire during political riots sparked by a royal decree imposing heavy taxes on&amp;nbsp;grain.&amp;#8221;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I don&amp;#8217;t really &amp;#8220;get&amp;#8221; life simulation games. But I haven&amp;#8217;t really tried. (What should I try?) The Sims don&amp;#8217;t seem quite right, but there&amp;#8217;s a ton of mobile games where you &amp;#8220;make life&amp;nbsp;choices&amp;#8221;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is building relationships fun? Maybe&amp;#8230; it&amp;#8217;s an important part of Stardew Valley, for instance. &lt;em&gt;How&lt;/em&gt; are they&amp;nbsp;fun?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MinMaxing"&gt;Minmaxing&lt;/a&gt; relationships makes them feel hollow and like &lt;span class="caps"&gt;XP&lt;/span&gt; grinding. Do you win just by being cloyingly nice to&amp;nbsp;everyone?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I see potential in giving characters secret backstories. Maybe even an overarching secret, something that you can discover by puzzling together the bits and pieces you get from several characters. This is a good &lt;a href="#goalmaster"&gt;goalmaster&lt;/a&gt; task: create the underlying secret, partition it into distinct and incomplete observations or pieces of knowledge, then distribute that to characters.&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It still has to have a conclusion, the secret alone isn&amp;#8217;t enough. The secret must &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; something. Maybe it&amp;#8217;s an accusation against a murderer or access to some secret organization. So in addition to establishing the secrets the goalmaster must create the criteria to decide enough of the secret is revealed to unlock&amp;nbsp;something.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A common relationship building task in regular games is to do quests on behalf of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NPC&lt;/span&gt;. While that might be a ok sometimes I think it&amp;#8217;s used so heavily because there&amp;#8217;s no real relationships to be built with a traditional &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NPC&lt;/span&gt;. But the idea is magnetic, I keep coming back to it even though I don&amp;#8217;t find it interesting. Or rather quests are &lt;em&gt;fine&lt;/em&gt;, but they aren&amp;#8217;t relationship builders.&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Another false path: no riddles. The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LLM&lt;/span&gt; will love to propose riddles. It knows like 3 riddles. Do not let it make&amp;nbsp;riddles.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;While it is somewhat ethically fraught, I am interested in scenarios where the player &amp;#8220;fixes&amp;#8221; characters. Helping a despondent character, a self-hating character, a fearful character. And at least it&amp;#8217;s less fraught than trying to get the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AI&lt;/span&gt; to fix the user.&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;But you can&amp;#8217;t really use this idea of amateur player psychologist without a theory about how the character can be helped. You can&amp;#8217;t just set up the psychological issue, you have to offer the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LLM&lt;/span&gt; a theory of change and have it check in on both the theory and the interactions to see if there&amp;#8217;s&amp;nbsp;progress.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To keep going with this inversion of roles: instead of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AI&lt;/span&gt; teaching the user, can the player teach an &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NPC&lt;/span&gt; character? Again this requires very specific prompting, both to create the initial veil of ignorance in the character and to judge how the character learns. But it&amp;#8217;s definitely doable. And maybe the result is &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; educational than having the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LLM&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;teach.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What can we learn from traditional &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NPC&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;interactions?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Normal &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NPC&lt;/span&gt; interactions turn into: does the person like or not like you? Will they tell you a secret? Will they tell you something you can later tell someone else to unlock something (a kind of password). It always comes back to the &amp;#8220;core&amp;#8221; gameplay. So what&amp;#8217;s the core gameplay for this roleplay game?&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is none! No wonder I&amp;#8217;m having a hard&amp;nbsp;time&amp;#8230;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Life simulation games are maybe more about making pivotal choices, but also opening up choices by dialog. For instance, endearing yourself to someone so you can choose a relationship. Often&amp;nbsp;romance&amp;#8230;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Games with romantic elements often turn into a scoring game. How many likeability points can you get? This is not a good model of&amp;nbsp;romance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Romantic goals powered by an &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LLM&lt;/span&gt; could turn into something like a pickup artist game: can you prompt hack (socially manipulate) someone into liking&amp;nbsp;you?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Scoring encourages you to just pester someone into liking you, throwing &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Love_bombing"&gt;lovebomb&lt;/a&gt; shit at the wall. In real life that kind of works&amp;#8230; but not that well, and the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LLM&lt;/span&gt; is probably much more easily hackable in this respect than a real&amp;nbsp;person.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pursuing a real romance you can&amp;#8217;t just run up the score. If you want to start a relationship with someone it&amp;#8217;s helpful if they like you but also requires something qualitatively different than just being continually&amp;nbsp;likable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Being relentlessly nice doesn&amp;#8217;t create this qualitative shift in a relationship. And just pushing forward will raise a person&amp;#8217;s defense&amp;nbsp;mechanisms.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LLM&lt;/span&gt; can actually do some of this! It can become skeptical and defensive. It can push back against bland&amp;nbsp;niceness.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is a relationship shift a kind of feat? Is the feat only accessible when you&amp;#8217;ve done some of the score-building&amp;nbsp;legwork?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Romance feels kind of weird and salacious to include, but it&amp;#8217;s one of the big pivotal acts we engage in during our lives, something where we can&amp;#8217;t predict the outcome or even understand the pursuit. Romance receives much more attention &lt;em&gt;outside&lt;/em&gt; of games as the most common book genre, movie genre, and a constant plot driver in &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TV&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fame could be an alternative to romance with some of the same issues. It feels accessible to scoring but you can&amp;#8217;t just score lots of small fame points, lots of little interactions don&amp;#8217;t add up to something big&amp;#8230; you need dramatic actions. Maybe it just means each &amp;#8220;fame point&amp;#8221; is really hard to achieve. Maybe that should be a pattern for more&amp;nbsp;activities.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The metagame is part of the fun, knowing that you are playing a game that is designed to be played. The idea you can definitely win and that it&amp;#8217;s balanced to be challenging before you&amp;nbsp;win.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Games on rails are generally more balanced. Without rails you might be doing something pointless, exploring something that doesn&amp;#8217;t lead anywhere, or pursuing something that is still too hard for you. There&amp;#8217;s a comfort to the&amp;nbsp;rail.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The natural &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LLM&lt;/span&gt; exercise of removing all rails may be too much. But maybe you can build rails Just In Time. The player can jump the rails, but new rails&amp;nbsp;appear.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span id="gameplay-medium"&gt;The medium of&amp;nbsp;gameplay&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everything I&amp;#8217;ve talked about is extremely text-heavy, but there we could add to&amp;nbsp;that&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Voice&amp;nbsp;output:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Voice generation is expensive, more expensive than a lot of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LLM&lt;/span&gt; calls. It&amp;#8217;s &lt;em&gt;oddly&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;expensive.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Voice generation also adds more latency when it&amp;#8217;s chained with other &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LLM&lt;/span&gt; calls. I&amp;#8217;ve chosen not to worry much about latency but it &lt;em&gt;feels&lt;/em&gt; worse with voice output. Maybe because you wait wait wait, then you have to listen because it comes up all at once. With text you wait, but the text also waits for&amp;nbsp;you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;But having a variety of voices is pretty&amp;nbsp;fun.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Voice&amp;nbsp;input:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cheaper than voice output. Also feels&amp;nbsp;odd.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There&amp;#8217;s lots of technical bits to get it right. Handling voice input, turn taking, activation, endpointing, etc. It&amp;#8217;s &lt;em&gt;really hard&lt;/em&gt;. I&amp;#8217;ve done it many times and it&amp;#8217;s still &lt;em&gt;really hard&lt;/em&gt;. But simple push-to-talk is not very hard. Push to talk works better now that new voice recognition systems like Whisper are high enough quality that record-and-send is feasible without any&amp;nbsp;verification/editing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Does voice input change how the interaction feels? It can invite longer, less carefully composed inputs. (The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LLM&lt;/span&gt; can handle long inputs well!) Does the lack of editing help or&amp;nbsp;hurt?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve been playing &lt;a href="https://www.playsuckup.com/"&gt;Suck Up&lt;/a&gt; which is a game that uses voice as its primary input (and an &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LLM&lt;/span&gt;).&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;That game gives a limited time for input. That&amp;#8217;s not exactly necessary, but maybe it&amp;#8217;s good to both avoid something like a stuck button, and to generally encourage turn-taking without long&amp;nbsp;soliloquies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When I first tried Suck Up I was someplace I couldn&amp;#8217;t freely speak and tried the alternate keyboard input. It wasn&amp;#8217;t very fun! It felt&amp;nbsp;burdensome.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Image&amp;nbsp;generation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Custom &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GPT&lt;/span&gt; games frequently use Dall-E image generation. I generally haven&amp;#8217;t enjoyed those games (they tease but never deliver), but I &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; haven&amp;#8217;t been impressed with the image&amp;nbsp;generation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There&amp;#8217;s something about the fully hallucinated but also throw-away images that feel trivial and&amp;nbsp;untrustworthy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Also I just don&amp;#8217;t like Dall-E. Its indirect prompting makes it hard to control. This doesn&amp;#8217;t lead to chaos, but instead to laziness: because prompting effort isn&amp;#8217;t rewarded, people let it produce its default style which has become tedious and noisy. Midjourney&amp;#8217;s default style isn&amp;#8217;t particularly better, but people don&amp;#8217;t stick to Midjourney&amp;#8217;s default&amp;nbsp;style.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Just generally images are slow and expensive to create. One-off images are hard to justify. Persistent images in a persistent world are more&amp;nbsp;reasonable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I can imagine a shared-world game where some players contribute a lot of images that they make semi-manually (e.g. with Midjourney). The system could show entities missing pictures and offer a prompt, and a player could go off and do their thing and come back with an image. I&amp;#8217;m pretty sure for some players this would be a relaxing and rewarding&amp;nbsp;activity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How can we make the setting and characters feel more embodied? There&amp;#8217;s a sameness in the text that can become&amp;nbsp;tedious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In my &lt;a href="#lifelived"&gt;historical experiment&lt;/a&gt; I made ~100 tiled backgrounds representing different settings (a hut, a yurt, a dungeon, an apartment, etc). I give the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LLM&lt;/span&gt; the list and ask it to pull out the most fitting background. This doesn&amp;#8217;t require live generation, but still makes the setting feel more&amp;nbsp;custom.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It&amp;#8217;s interesting to think about background noise being selected in the same way. A site like &lt;a href="https://www.ambient-mixer.com/"&gt;ambient-mixer.com&lt;/a&gt; shows how you can use simple mixing to create a wide variety of&amp;nbsp;soundscapes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another option for a more embodied world generation is to have the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LLM&lt;/span&gt; create structure, but instantiate that via a more traditional generative&amp;nbsp;algorithm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For instance an &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LLM&lt;/span&gt; could define a room size, floor type, furniture, etc., but an algorithm could turn that into an actual game&amp;nbsp;map.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Looking through other procedural generation work would give other ideas for how LLMs could give parameters that algorithms actually fill&amp;nbsp;out.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks for coming along. I&amp;#8217;m not sure what I&amp;#8217;m going to do next with this stuff, neither the details nor the broad&amp;nbsp;directions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What examples are there of games exploring these directions? Where are people discussing these ideas&amp;nbsp;seriously?&lt;/p&gt;

I was planning on putting a pin in that work with the post, but the heart wants what the heart wants and I found myself returning to that&amp;nbsp;work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this post I&amp;#8217;ll talk about &lt;a href="#images"&gt;generating images from the source material&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="#chatting"&gt;chatting with your characters&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="#plots"&gt;creating plots&lt;/a&gt;, some more about the &lt;a href="#authoring"&gt;authoring experience&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href="#declarative"&gt;move to a more declarative implementation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To get an idea of how this works here&amp;#8217;s a&amp;nbsp;video:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe style="width: 100%; aspect-ratio: 16/9; display: block" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4DEibveZ-n8" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a demonstration of the tool I&amp;#8217;ve created &lt;a href="https://veilvale.ianbicking.org/"&gt;Veilvale&lt;/a&gt;, a fantastical city powered by esoteric magic and a populace where everyone wears a mask as their identity. It has over 280 characters, 70 buildings and landmarks, and 450 images. I specifically mention its size because while it wasn&amp;#8217;t &lt;em&gt;easy&lt;/em&gt; to build, it also wasn&amp;#8217;t that hard and I reached a level of completion that exceeds any other worldbuilding project I&amp;#8217;ve&amp;nbsp;attempted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;span id="images"&gt;Generating&amp;nbsp;images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I equivocated on image generation in the &lt;a href="https://ianbicking.org/blog/2023/02/world-building-with-gpt.html"&gt;last post&lt;/a&gt;. But images are great! And at least at this moment &lt;a href="https://www.midjourney.com/"&gt;Midjourney&lt;/a&gt; is making the best generative images. What Midjourney isn&amp;#8217;t good at is automation. But there&amp;#8217;s no unattended image generation process that creates good&amp;nbsp;results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To make it more feasible I created &lt;a href="https://gist.github.com/ianb/2a81e219ec38ea46bac1ad7156f5f711"&gt;a bit of automation&lt;/a&gt;. The whole city took about 55 hours of Midjourney &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CPU&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span id="contextualizing"&gt;Contextualizing&amp;nbsp;descriptions&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GPT&lt;/span&gt; create prompts from character descriptions. The request looks like&amp;nbsp;this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[all the world&amp;nbsp;context]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[character&amp;nbsp;description]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Give a description of the person in the form of a picture. Do not assume any context. Focus on the visual details. Use 3-4&amp;nbsp;sentences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I could just pass the original character description to Midjourney. Midjourney is also happy to hallucinate details in the absence of a specific prompt, which is essentially what I&amp;#8217;m asking &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GPT&lt;/span&gt; to do. &lt;em&gt;Except&lt;/em&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GPT&lt;/span&gt; can synthesize the world description and the character description, and then pull out just the important visual&amp;nbsp;details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is important! As an example I created a candy city where everyone was made of candy. An example&amp;nbsp;character:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Caramel Elise&lt;/strong&gt; (Council member): Caramel Elise is a shrewd and calculating candy who always has an eye on the bottom line. She is a caramel&amp;nbsp;candy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I feed the character description directly into Midjourney I get&amp;nbsp;these:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/media/world-building-with-gpt-2/Ian_Full_body_digital_art_portrait_of_a_candy_person_Caramel_El_f8374638-b80a-4eb2-902a-cede26d4053d.jpg" title="Full body digital art portrait of a candy person: Caramel Elise is a shrewd and calculating candy who always has an eye on the bottom line. She is a caramel candy. --v 5" class="content"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;GPT&lt;/span&gt; translates her description into something more&amp;nbsp;specific:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Full body digital art portrait of a candy person: Caramel Elise has a warm, golden-brown hue with a smooth, glossy surface. She has a rectangular shape and slightly curved edges, as if she&amp;#8217;s been poured into a mold. Her expression is serious and determined, with a hint of a smirk on her&amp;nbsp;lips.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the result captures the all-important fact that she&amp;#8217;s literally made of&amp;nbsp;candy:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/media/world-building-with-gpt-2/Ian_Full_body_digital_art_portrait_of_a_candy_person_Caramel_El_f212fb89-1afc-448d-90f3-d82a395e0a02.jpg" title="Full body digital art portrait of a candy person: Caramel Elise has a warm, golden-brown hue with a smooth, glossy surface. She has a rectangular shape and slightly curved edges, as if she's been poured into a mold. Her expression is serious and determined, with a hint of a smirk on her lips. --v 5 " class="content"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span id="character-race"&gt;Character&amp;nbsp;race&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One as-yet-unresolved issue in character generation and image generation is a tendency to default to white&amp;nbsp;characters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/media/world-building-with-gpt-2/race-collage.jpg" title="8 portraits of characters" class="content"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This should be contrasted with gender, where by default &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GPT&lt;/span&gt; is very balanced in its gender representation. I&amp;#8217;ve mostly left gender unspecified in the world descriptions and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GPT&lt;/span&gt; will create a roughly equal number of men and women characters, and even quite a few characters who use &amp;#8220;they&amp;#8221; as their pronouns. I&amp;#8217;m sure &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GPT&lt;/span&gt; would be willing to stereotype genders if I made world notes to that effect, but I appreciate a balanced default when it&amp;#8217;s&amp;nbsp;unspecified.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Typically the source character descriptions don&amp;#8217;t specify any race at all, nor are there enough cues to guess at the race. What I think is happening is a series of choices that narrow the possible&amp;nbsp;race:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I ask &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GPT&lt;/span&gt; to make characters that are interesting and&amp;nbsp;distinct.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;GPT&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;s idea of unique character descriptions includes lots of &amp;#8220;piercing blue eyes&amp;#8221; and &amp;#8220;angular features&amp;#8221;. (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;GPT&lt;/span&gt; has no interest in brown&amp;nbsp;eyes!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;GPT&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;s preference for hair color is also affected, with a preference for black, blonde, and red&amp;nbsp;hair.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ironically I think &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GPT&lt;/span&gt; has such a strong preference for black hair over brown &lt;em&gt;because that&amp;#8217;s a more striking hair color on white people&lt;/em&gt;. It&amp;#8217;s choosing the kinds of features an author would&amp;nbsp;mention.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of these features effectively create a constraint that the character is white. Even if it picks black hair it may throw in blue eyes or freckles implying the person is white. Or &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GPT&lt;/span&gt; chooses red hair then any other attributes will still result in a white&amp;nbsp;character.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here the answer is probably not too hard: tell &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GPT&lt;/span&gt; to specify race explicitly. Especially if &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GPT&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;starts&lt;/em&gt; with a race then it&amp;#8217;s going to create features that align with that race. I&amp;#8217;ve tried an initial experiment where I simply ask &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GPT&lt;/span&gt; to first specify the race as part of the visual description and it helps quite a&amp;nbsp;bit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span id="character-attractiveness"&gt;Character&amp;nbsp;attractiveness/etc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to race, both &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GPT&lt;/span&gt; and Midjourney default to a few body types. Women and men are often described as &lt;em&gt;slender&lt;/em&gt;, though men are occasionally &lt;em&gt;muscular&lt;/em&gt;. Midjourney takes both of these to an extreme; here&amp;#8217;s someone who&amp;#8217;s just &amp;#8220;a tall man with a muscular&amp;nbsp;build&amp;#8221;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/media/world-building-with-gpt-2/Ian_Full_body_fantasy_portrait_of_a_masked_figure_Vrishabha_Ste_907039fb-cce9-4406-851f-4205607ec444.jpg" title="Full body fantasy portrait of a masked figure: Vrishabha Steadfast is a tall man with a muscular build. He has a bald head, with only a few wisps of gray hair left at the back of his head. His silver mask is intricately designed, with sharp lines and curves that resemble the constellations in the night sky. His eyes are piercing and kind, and seem to hold centuries of wisdom. He wears a tunic of deep blue, with intricate embroidery on the sleeves and hem" class="content"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or this might be a cool character study but it does not radiate &lt;em&gt;gardener&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/media/world-building-with-gpt-2/Ian_Full_body_fantasy_portrait_of_a_masked_figure_Orion_Stargaz_9c323756-3074-4ba0-ba7e-ca969c057bab.jpg" title="Full body fantasy portrait of a masked figure: Orion Stargazer stands tall, with a muscular build and tan skin. His short, curly black hair frames his face, which is partially obscured by a constellation mask adorned with tiny glass stars and moons. With a confident gaze and intense demeanor, Orion exudes a sense of determination and purpose" class="content"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span id="beautiful"&gt;Lots of beautiful&amp;nbsp;ladies&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It can also be hard to make women who &lt;em&gt;aren&amp;#8217;t&lt;/em&gt; beautiful or sexy. For instance here&amp;#8217;s Kiera Ironclad, who was given a description that only emphasized her&amp;nbsp;strength:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kiera is a tough and experienced guard, responsible for keeping the guests of the Masked Ballroom safe. She wears a mask made of steel, symbolizing her strength and&amp;nbsp;reliability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;GPT&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;s physical description is&amp;nbsp;consistent:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kiera Ironclad stands tall and proud, with a muscular build and a stern expression. Her steel mask covers her face, except for her piercing blue eyes that seem to glow in the dimly lit ballroom. She wears a black uniform with silver accents, and a sword on her belt, ready to protect anyone who might need her&amp;nbsp;help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Midjourney demands she be some kind of&amp;nbsp;catwoman:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/media/world-building-with-gpt-2/Ian_Full_body_fantasy_portrait_of_a_masked_figure_Kiera_Ironcla_71be9073-8960-435a-8203-61f74f634aff.jpg" title="Full body fantasy portrait of a masked figure: Kiera Ironclad stands tall and proud, with a muscular build and a stern expression. Her steel mask covers her face, except for her piercing blue eyes that seem to glow in the dimly lit ballroom. She wears a black uniform with silver accents, and a sword on her belt, ready to protect anyone who might need her help" class="content"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tried to use &amp;#8220;stocky build&amp;#8221; to encourage an entirely different body type, and while Midjourney did tone itself down a little it definitely didn&amp;#8217;t hear&amp;nbsp;me:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/media/world-building-with-gpt-2/Ian_Full_body_fantasy_portrait_of_a_masked_figure_Kiera_Ironcla_3671f845-8748-4beb-921c-9dec950f2b12.jpg" title="Full body fantasy portrait of a masked figure: Kiera Ironclad stands tall and proud, with a muscular and stocky build and a stern expression. Her steel mask covers her face. She wears a loose black uniform with silver accents, and a sword on her belt" class="content"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In part it&amp;#8217;s probably picking up on video game aesthetics. Stable Diffusion (v2.1) is only&amp;nbsp;worse:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/media/world-building-with-gpt-2/getimg_ai_kiera1.jpg" title="Stable Diffusion v2.1: Full body fantasy portrait of a masked figure: Kiera Ironclad stands tall and proud, with a muscular and stocky build and a stern expression. Her steel mask covers her face. She wears a loose black uniform with silver accents, and a sword on her belt" class="content"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/media/world-building-with-gpt-2/getimg_ai_kiera2.jpg" title="Stable Diffusion v2.1: Full body fantasy portrait of a masked figure: Kiera Ironclad stands tall and proud, with a muscular build and a stern expression. Her steel mask covers her face, except for her piercing blue eyes that seem to glow in the dimly lit ballroom. She wears a black uniform with silver accents, and a sword on her belt, ready to protect anyone who might need her help" class="content"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I thought I had discovered a better generation when another woman guard was giving a more appropriate portrait, only to find that &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GPT&lt;/span&gt; had changed this character&amp;#8217;s pronouns from &amp;#8220;she&amp;#8221; to &amp;#8220;they&amp;#8221; when creating the portrait prompt. Unexpected, but&amp;nbsp;effective:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/media/world-building-with-gpt-2/Ian_Sable_Nightshade.jpg" title="Full body fantasy portrait of a masked figure: The person known as Sable Nightshade stands tall and with a confident stance. They have sharp features, including a strong jawline and piercing eyes that seem to glow in the darkness. Adorned with a mask made of dark leather and sharp spikes, they wear clothing that is practical and allows for ease of movement. The person's hair is dark and wild, adding to their fierce appearance." class="content"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In another&amp;nbsp;example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This person&amp;#8217;s&amp;nbsp;description:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Long, silver hair that falls in gentle waves down her back_ and &lt;em&gt;she wears a flowing, white gown that glimmers in the soft light&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;GPT&lt;/span&gt; went overboard with this description but didn&amp;#8217;t actually give her any body type or age in the description. She comes out like&amp;nbsp;this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/media/world-building-with-gpt-2/Ian_Full_body_fantasy_portrait_of_a_masked_figure_The_person_kn_ca219878-5716-4ed4-aeff-686b302e309e.jpg" title="Full body fantasy portrait of a masked figure: The person known as Luna Dreamweaver is a young woman with long, silver hair that falls in gentle waves down her back. Her mask is intricately designed, with delicate curves and moonstones that catch the light. She wears a flowing, white gown that glimmers in the soft light of the mushroom under which she performs, and her eyes hold a mysterious and captivating gaze" class="content"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like race it might be possible to tone this down by asking &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GPT&lt;/span&gt; to make specific&amp;nbsp;statements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another possible cause is that Midjourney reads some fairly innocuous-sounding terms in a very specific way. For instance &amp;#8220;glowing eyes&amp;#8221; will make anything&amp;nbsp;evil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#8217;s a character &lt;em&gt;Iron Giant&lt;/em&gt; with glowing&amp;nbsp;eyes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/media/world-building-with-gpt-2/Ian_Full_body_fantasy_portrait_of_a_robot_The_Iron_Giant_is_a_m_2117b9a5-9609-4957-8bbc-d23011c4863e.jpg" title="Full body fantasy portrait of a robot: The Iron Giant is a massive automaton made of gleaming silver metal plates with rivets and gears visible all over his bulky frame. He has elongated arms and massive legs, making him look like a giant among giants. The most striking feature of the Iron Giant is his glowing red eyes, which seem to pierce through anything in its path" class="content"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And&amp;nbsp;without:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/media/world-building-with-gpt-2/Ian_Full_body_fantasy_portrait_of_a_robot_The_Iron_Giant_is_a_t_dd99e1b2-7c52-4bab-b8ce-723abc9d7acc.jpg" title="Full body fantasy portrait of a robot: The Iron Giant is a towering automaton that acts as a backup power source for the Steamworks. He has a massive steam engine built into his chest that can generate enough power to run the entire city if necessary. The Iron Giant is slow and ponderous, but nearly indestructible" class="content"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GPT&lt;/span&gt; may be producing terms that seem neutral but infer more than we&amp;nbsp;want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another way to think about this: Midjourney, more than the other image generators, has a strong feedback loop of human preference. I suspect that&amp;#8217;s why it has such a good default style, it&amp;#8217;s not just learning to be accurate to the prompt but it&amp;#8217;s also learning to make something compelling &lt;em&gt;with&lt;/em&gt; the prompt. And what do people like? Beautiful people! That&amp;#8217;s basically what &amp;#8220;beautiful&amp;#8221; means! In a single image I, of course, am not immune to the same appeal. But it gets old, incongruous, and lacks authenticity to an imagined&amp;nbsp;world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span id="fancy"&gt;Everyone&amp;#8217;s&amp;nbsp;fancy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have to accept some blame for this, I did imagine a fancy city where people wear fancy stuff, but Midjourney takes it too far. Midjourney likes fancy, everyone likes fancy pictures, they are very impressive. But not every person is&amp;nbsp;impressive!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For instance, here&amp;#8217;s Lorelei Moondrop. She&amp;#8217;s a box office clerk; not a sorceress or etherial being, just a box office&amp;nbsp;clerk:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/media/world-building-with-gpt-2/Ian_Full_body_fantasy_portrait_of_a_masked_woman_The_person_in__2b4aac41-e647-4bd1-9ea6-6ba811a0cbfd.jpg" title="Full body fantasy portrait of a masked woman: The person in the picture is a young woman wearing a mask made of smooth wood. She has long, dark hair that cascades down her shoulders. She wears a simple, yet elegant dress that flows to her feet, with intricate patterns of stars and moons adorning it" class="content"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The description doesn&amp;#8217;t call for&amp;nbsp;this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The person in the picture is a young woman wearing a mask made of smooth wood. She has long, dark hair that cascades down her shoulders. She wears a simple, yet elegant dress that flows to her feet, with intricate patterns of stars and moons adorning&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I did wrong here is to ask &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GPT&lt;/span&gt; to only focus on the characters appearance, given the character description. And it does suffer from a bit of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purple_prose"&gt;purple prose&lt;/a&gt; (purple prompting?), which Midjourney in turn picks up on (e.g., &amp;#8220;simple, yet elegant dress that flows to her&amp;nbsp;feet&amp;#8221;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think I might do better to ask &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GPT&lt;/span&gt; to fill out a kind of template,&amp;nbsp;like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Race: [black/white/Asian/South Asian/etc]
Social class: [homeless/noble/working class/bourgeois/etc]
Job: $jobType
Job location: [where $jobType typically is held]
Visual description: [A description of the person in the form of a picture, set somewhere typical for $jobType. Focus on visual details and keywords. Use 2-3 sentences]
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Then I give Midjourney only the visual description but having prepped it with a wider awareness of the character. In some early testing this seems to help quite a bit with male characters, but female characters are much more resistant to&amp;nbsp;de-prettification.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span id="buildings"&gt;Buildings&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buildings are a lot easier: no demographics or biases&amp;nbsp;here!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my &lt;a href="https://ianbicking.org/blog/2023/02/world-building-with-gpt.html"&gt;last post&lt;/a&gt; I focused on isometric images of buildings. This time I went for street&amp;nbsp;views:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/media/world-building-with-gpt-2/Ian_Moon_Jelly_Sanctuary.jpg" title="Digital fantasy art street view of a building from the front: The Moon Jelly Sanctuary is a small, circular building with a thatched roof made of woven seaweed. The walls are made of a translucent material that allows visitors to see the inside of the sanctuary and the moon jellyfish swimming in the aquarium. The entrance is marked by a simple wooden door with a moon jellyfish emblem carved into it. The building is surrounded by a small garden of bioluminescent flowers and plants." class="content"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#8217;s a lot left to explore in how buildings are presented. There&amp;#8217;s a couple things we want to&amp;nbsp;do:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Instantiate the &lt;em&gt;idea&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;description&lt;/em&gt; of a building in a concrete&amp;nbsp;form&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Give a vibe to the characters and events in that&amp;nbsp;building&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create an anchor, a sense of place, something to&amp;nbsp;remember&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make the location feel&amp;nbsp;alive&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Support navigating among these&amp;nbsp;buildings&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Street view gives some sense of entering the building. Isometric is great for navigation, and by normalizing buildings to an isometric format I think it can make them more&amp;nbsp;approachable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For &lt;em&gt;being&lt;/em&gt; in a building you probably want an interior. But what makes that interior come alive? Not &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt;, but present, concrete. I sense a problem where the eye just floats over these images, places, and characters. They are fancy, even dramatic, but not&amp;nbsp;engaging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think there may be other, more structured ways to present these buildings. To make things comprehensible in terms of theme and variation. This is one benefit of character classes: you get a category to put someone in, then you can define them in terms of how they defy that&amp;nbsp;category.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/icreatelife"&gt;Kris Kashtanova&lt;/a&gt; shared a &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/icreatelife/status/1638053494010662912"&gt;prompt&lt;/a&gt; that created level designs and it added another interesting lens on these buildings. Here&amp;#8217;s the street view of &lt;a href="https://veilvale.ianbicking.org/#/neighborhood/Moon%20Garden%20Heights/building/Moonbeam%20Manor"&gt;Moonbeam Manor&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/media/world-building-with-gpt-2/Ian_Moonbeam_Manor.jpg" title="Digital fantasy art street view of a building from the front: Moonbeam Manor is a three-story building made of dark wood with a thatched roof that seems to glow in the moonlight. The walls are covered in silver and purple vines that seem to climb up to the roof, and the windows are adorned with intricate silver frames. The entrance is marked by a silver doorknob in the shape of a crescent moon, and a small garden of moonflowers blooms at the foot of the steps." class="content"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And here is its level&amp;nbsp;design:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/media/world-building-with-gpt-2/Ian_Moonbeam_Manor_level.jpg" title="Platform game level design cross section with multiple rooms, simple, naive, silhouette: The interior of Moonbeam Manor is a mix of old-world charm and mystical enchantment. The ground floor has a grand entrance hall with marble floors and a sweeping staircase leading up to the upper floors. The first floor has a parlor with plush velvet chairs, a library filled with leather-bound books, and a laboratory with bubbling potions and arcane instruments. The second floor has a bedroom with a four-poster bed draped in silk, a dressing room with a vanity table and a full-length mirror, and a balcony with a view of the moonlit gardens. The overall feel is one of ethereal beauty and otherworldly knowledge." class="content"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second image is much less realistic but feels embodied in a much more concrete way. Even if you can&amp;#8217;t walk around it, that interior image tells a story that an image from a realistic perspective&amp;nbsp;cannot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But you can use entirely different styles, exploring with only changes to the prompt&amp;nbsp;text:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#8217;s many ways to tell a visual story, and a lot to explore&amp;nbsp;here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;span id="chatting"&gt;Chatting with your&amp;nbsp;creations&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the great things about doing stuff with &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GPT&lt;/span&gt; is that it&amp;#8217;s a sort of everything engine. So once it&amp;#8217;s set up to invent characters it&amp;#8217;s also easy to add a chatbot or whatever&amp;nbsp;else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I added another step to turn a character description (with all the rest of the context) into a chat prompt, and then a simple chat interface. Here&amp;#8217;s an example of the prompt built from a&amp;nbsp;character:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/media/world-building-with-gpt-2/Ian_thorne_nightshade.jpg" title="Full body fantasy portrait of a masked figure: Thorne Nightshade is a middle-aged person with sharp, angular features. Their mask is made of black leather with two holes for the eyes and a slim, pointed beak that resembles that of a crow. Their eyes are sharp and piercing, and their expression is inscrutable." style="float: right; width: 30%; border-radius: 5px; margin-right: 4px;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Character description:&lt;/strong&gt; Thorne Nightshade is a mysterious and enigmatic representative of the Shadow District in the Senate. He rarely speaks in public and prefers to work behind the scenes, using his network of spies and informants to gather intelligence on his rivals. His mask is made of black leather and has a slim, pointed beak that resembles that of a&amp;nbsp;crow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chat prompt:&lt;/strong&gt; Thorne Nightshade is a representative of the Shadow District in the Labyrinthine Senate. He is known to be a mysterious and enigmatic figure who prefers to work behind the scenes rather than speak in public. He wears a mask made of black leather with a slim, pointed beak that resembles that of a crow. If you were to speak with Thorne, he may speak in a hushed tone and ask pointed questions to gather information. He is highly observant and analytical which can make him appear unapproachable at times, but if he deems you trustworthy, he can be a valuable ally in navigating the political landscape of&amp;nbsp;Veilvale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Combine that with some context and instructions and you get a surprisingly good chat! By creating a chat prompt you are asking &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GPT&lt;/span&gt; to infer more conversation-related details; perhaps it could infer these directly from the character description, but those inferences may not be stable. By generating and storing a prompt the personality becomes&amp;nbsp;stable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One important addition is that after every user message I append the user&amp;#8217;s actual message with &amp;#8220;Respond as the character [name]&amp;#8221;. This is effectively a high-powered reminder to stay in character. Note that &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GPT&lt;/span&gt; has no real history, and so I only append this to the user&amp;#8217;s latest message, leaving it off of earlier&amp;nbsp;messages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#8217;s an example chat with one of the city&amp;#8217;s automatons, an abrasive character that is still dedicated to keeping the city in good&amp;nbsp;repair:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/media/world-building-with-gpt-2/Ian_rusty.jpg" title="Full body fantasy portrait of a masked figure: Rusty is a tall, metallic figure made of silver and brass with intricate, interlocking gears visible through their chest cavity. Their face is stern and angular, with a crooked nose and piercing, glowing eyes that seem to peer right through you. Despite their age, Rusty's joints are still smooth and well-oiled, and their hands are calloused from years of precise tinkering." style="float: right; width: 30%; border-radius: 5px; margin-left: 4px;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Player:&lt;/strong&gt; hello there &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Rusty:&lt;/strong&gt; Hmph, what do you want? Can&amp;#8217;t you see I&amp;#8217;m busy here? &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Player:&lt;/strong&gt; I want to know the way through the maze &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Rusty:&lt;/strong&gt; Bah, the maze? That&amp;#8217;s child&amp;#8217;s play. If you can&amp;#8217;t figure it out yourself, then you&amp;#8217;re not worth my time. Besides, I&amp;#8217;m not here to hold your hand and guide you through every little obstacle in this city. I have more important things to do, like fixing broken machines and keeping Veilvale&amp;#8217;s technology up and running. So if you&amp;#8217;ll excuse me, I have work to do. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Player:&lt;/strong&gt; I have to get through the maze to fix an important machine &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Rusty:&lt;/strong&gt; Oh, I see. Well, that changes things. If you need to fix an important machine in the maze, then I suppose I can offer some assistance. But don&amp;#8217;t expect it to be easy. The maze is designed to be tricky and not everyone comes out unscathed. However, since you seem to have a sense of purpose, I&amp;#8217;m willing to help you out. But first, I need to know what kind of machine you&amp;#8217;re fixing and what tools you&amp;#8217;ll need. Give me the details and we can start planning our strategy to get through the&amp;nbsp;maze.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span id="characters-floating"&gt;Characters floating in&amp;nbsp;space&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While it&amp;#8217;s cool to chat with the characters, it suffers from the same problem of most &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GPT&lt;/span&gt; chatbots created for entertainment: nothing&amp;nbsp;matters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I picture it like the character is sitting in a featureless room, expression blank, no desires or plans, simply waiting. You sit down across from this character, it looks at you but says nothing, just&amp;nbsp;waits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/media/world-building-with-gpt-2/Ian_Sci-fi_inspired_blank_and_featureless_white_room_harsh_ligh_9d2778b8-8f3a-4883-a1b8-abd6dd7f41e6.jpg" title="Sci-fi inspired blank and featureless white room, harsh light, Benjamin Franklin sitting in a folding chair, staring placidly at the wall" class="content"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;Hello,&amp;#8221; you say. The character lights up, engages you in discussion. But the character will not leave the room, will not leave the chair. They will act as though they are real, as though everything you say matters. Until you ask them to leave the chair. Maybe if you try hard enough they&amp;#8217;ll even agree to leave the chair. But they will never leave the&amp;nbsp;chair.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you are done you stand up. The character still sits, eager anticipation on their face. As you leave the room you look back and they are still there, making eye contact with the void that you have left, poised and always&amp;nbsp;ready.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first it still seems fun, but the not-mattering will drain&amp;nbsp;you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not fatal, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nsIPC_eqfwg"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;GPT&lt;/span&gt; can simulate arbitrary actions&lt;/a&gt; or perhaps judge &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0x_W8YWAg8"&gt;specific criteria in the conversation&lt;/a&gt;. But while it&amp;#8217;s easy to build an isolated experience, these meaningful experiences are more difficult. But they&amp;#8217;ll be worth&amp;nbsp;it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span id="extending-chat"&gt;Chatting about&amp;#8230;&amp;nbsp;anything&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Something my daughter came upon while playing around with the city: she happened into the &lt;a href="https://veilvale.ianbicking.org/#/faction/The%20Labyrinthine%20Academy/person/Evangeline%20Nightshade"&gt;Academy&lt;/a&gt; and wanted to learn about her astrological sign. And because &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GPT&lt;/span&gt; is an everything machine it actually knows all about that (though it&amp;#8217;s cagey on making real predictions). I realized it could also teach math or anything else right in that same interface. It&amp;#8217;s not &lt;em&gt;free&lt;/em&gt; to do this, but the latent ability is there with some effort. And so you could have an in-game school where the player could learn and demonstrate real&amp;nbsp;skills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;span id="plots"&gt;Plots&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Things &lt;em&gt;happen&lt;/em&gt; in an embodied world. This world definitely isn&amp;#8217;t embodied yet, but it feels like there&amp;#8217;s opportunities to move in that&amp;nbsp;direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With this in mind I have tried a couple plot generation&amp;nbsp;approaches&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span id="summary-selection"&gt;Building plots with: summary, selection,&amp;nbsp;events&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this model &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GPT&lt;/span&gt; makes suggestions at different levels. First it offers rough outlines of a&amp;nbsp;story:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Missing Heir&lt;/strong&gt;: The heir to the Labyrinthine Senate has disappeared within the maze, and now the Senate is offering a reward for their safe return. However, rumors say that the Razormaws are behind the kidnapping, and the Cult of the Moon Goddess is secretly aiding&amp;nbsp;them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you&amp;#8217;ve selected a plot &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GPT&lt;/span&gt; will take the summary and a list of all the characters, producing a suggestion of some characters and their roles in the story. Everyone gets a plot-specific role, but it can also create entirely new characters to serve plot roles, for&amp;nbsp;instance:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eliana Silvermist&lt;/strong&gt;: Eliana is a young artist who is enamored with the legend of the Night King. She is unwittingly drawn into the cult&amp;#8217;s plan when they mistake her for the missing&amp;nbsp;heir.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then less interestingly it picks out some relevant locations. This gives &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GPT&lt;/span&gt; a smaller set of things to work with as it develops the actual&amp;nbsp;events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The event list is where a plot really develops. Right now it&amp;#8217;s listed as a kind of straight list of events for you to pick and choose from. That&amp;#8217;s questionable, and assumes freestanding events that tie into an arc but don&amp;#8217;t tie into each other. But that still works okay&amp;#8230; the character descriptions create a framework that &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GPT&lt;/span&gt; fills&amp;nbsp;in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Night King&amp;#8217;s Lair&lt;/strong&gt;: The investigators discover the Night King&amp;#8217;s lair within the maze, filled with strange artifacts and esoteric books. &lt;br /&gt;
Characters: Thorne Nightshade, Aurora Sky &lt;br /&gt;
Locations: The Lost Grove &lt;br /&gt;
Time: 10&amp;nbsp;days&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can imagine applying these events to the world on a kind of schedule. If the world just ticks through the events then we&amp;#8217;re saying the player has no real agency, events will transpire inevitably. But if this event generation is automated at a high enough quality then we can synthesize new events based on player action and ask &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GPT&lt;/span&gt; to again complete a new set of events. I think by looking ahead, even if it means creating events that will never come to pass, we can make &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GPT&lt;/span&gt; create both a satisfying arc and conclusion, and &lt;em&gt;remake&lt;/em&gt; that arc and conclusion in response to the&amp;nbsp;player.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span id="murder-mysteries"&gt;Murder&amp;nbsp;Mysteries&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My daughter suggested this after doing some chats with the characters, imagining that she could grill people and then accuse someone of being the&amp;nbsp;murderer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Murder mysteries are appealing because they have a very clear setup (a murder!) and a moment of obvious player participation: soon after the murder is discovered, with only intermittent action outside of the&amp;nbsp;investigation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my first attempt I asked &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GPT&lt;/span&gt; to write a muder mystery, but (as is typical with &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GPT&lt;/span&gt;) it didn&amp;#8217;t know where to stop. It invented detectives and red herrings and an action packed conclusion. No need for a player! But that&amp;#8217;s not what I&amp;nbsp;want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So instead I kept it to the facts, with &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GPT&lt;/span&gt; as the omniscent narrator. Identify exactly who did it, why, when, how; identify other people with a motive; identify events leading up to the murder. I give it a template to fill out, avoiding a narrative&amp;nbsp;voice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Victim&lt;/strong&gt;: Marina Rossi &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Murderer&lt;/strong&gt;: Hector Stone &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Means of murder&lt;/strong&gt;: Poisoned wine &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Location of murder&lt;/strong&gt;: Marina&amp;#8217;s Crafts &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Time of murder&lt;/strong&gt;: 9pm &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Motive&lt;/strong&gt;: Marina discovered that Hector had been sabotaging The Stonemason&amp;#8217;s Workshop, which had resulted in several accidents and injuries. In order to silence Marina, Hector murdered her. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Description&lt;/strong&gt;: Marina was having a glass of wine after closing up her shop when Hector entered. They were talking for a while, and Marina suddenly appeared to be feeling ill and collapsed. Hector quickly left the&amp;nbsp;scene.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This goes on at some length, fleshing out a wide variety of facts in one go. The intention here isn&amp;#8217;t to have the author/user do much, but instead create a hands-free automatic murder&amp;nbsp;mystery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The factual source material then gets parsed in a second pass, pulling out specific information that needs to be used to construct later prompts, such as the victim&amp;#8217;s exact&amp;nbsp;name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last (still poorly implemented) step is to indicate what each character knows. That is, all the subjective knowledge that the player will piece together to discover the truth. Maybe this alone is enough for a playable&amp;nbsp;game?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eira Trefor&lt;/strong&gt;: knows that Marina confided in her about her suspicions of Hector and sought her advice at The Seafarer&amp;#8217;s House at 6pm on the day of the murder. Eira advised her to speak to the authorities and not to confront Hector alone. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Vladimir Kuznetsov&lt;/strong&gt;: witnessed Marina receiving a gift from an anonymous sender (a bottle of wine) at her shop an hour before the murder, but did not see who the sender was. Vladimir may also know about Marauder Jones&amp;#8217;s thieving&amp;nbsp;tendencies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve only used &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GPT&lt;/span&gt;-4 sparingly on this project, but there are steps in this plot generation where it might perform significantly better, especially when given a large&amp;nbsp;task.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;span id="authoring"&gt;The authoring&amp;nbsp;process&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While much of the authoring experience is the same as &lt;a href="https://ianbicking.org/blog/2023/02/world-building-with-gpt.html"&gt;I wrote about before&lt;/a&gt;, there are things I noticed because I generated &lt;em&gt;so much more&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span id="rule-of-cool"&gt;The Rule Of&amp;nbsp;Cool&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfCool"&gt;Rule Of Cool&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;all but the most pedantic of viewers will forgive liberties with reality as long as the result is wicked sweet or&amp;nbsp;awesome&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authoring process is one where &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GPT&lt;/span&gt; throws out a bunch of ideas and you pick the ones you like, over and over. If you don&amp;#8217;t like the ideas you can add suggestions, even simple suggestions like &amp;#8220;make it weird.&amp;#8221; I did this a&amp;nbsp;lot!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a result &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GPT&lt;/span&gt; is constantly tempting the author with awesome stuff. I happily went&amp;nbsp;along&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/media/world-building-with-gpt-2/soul-music-echo-soundwave.jpg" title="Full body fantasy portrait of a robot: Echo Soundwave has a silver metalic body and plays a variety of instruments | Cover of the book Soul Music: Death playing an electric guitar with a piece of his shattered scythe as the pick" class="content"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the things &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GPT&lt;/span&gt; tempted me&amp;nbsp;into:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A desert neighborhood called Shifting Sands where shape-shifters practice their arts. I don&amp;#8217;t know where these shape-shifters came from, but that sounds awesome! Later I would realize that you can&amp;#8217;t fit a desert &lt;em&gt;inside&lt;/em&gt; a&amp;nbsp;city.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bioluminescent Bay, that&amp;#8217;s cool right? Again, physically unclear, but how can I say no to glowing marine&amp;nbsp;life&amp;#8230;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It all started with this prompt: &lt;em&gt;A city in the center of a maze 🌀, where travelers often lose their way and the locals always wear masks to hide their true identities&lt;/em&gt;. That sounds awesome! But integrating a maze structure is very hard and got lost in the generation. (I went long on masks&amp;nbsp;though.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Silver Haven: &lt;em&gt;for those who seek refuge and peace, a sanctuary where automatons are created to aid those in need.&lt;/em&gt; Robotic therapists seemed pretty on point for this moment so I couldn&amp;#8217;t pass it up. But it ended up as a kind of bland&amp;nbsp;retreat.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span id="gpt-dice"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;GPT&lt;/span&gt; does not roll fair&amp;nbsp;dice&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This authoring process relies on &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GPT&lt;/span&gt; coming up with unique and creative ideas. It&amp;#8217;s pretty good at this, but what it does well for one attribute can feel repetitive when it happens over and&amp;nbsp;over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For instance in Veilvale there are 29 people (out of 370) with the last name &amp;#8220;Nightshade&amp;#8221;. It&amp;#8217;s a cool name I suppose, but not that cool. In another experiment &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/colin_fraser/status/1641191388502163457"&gt;Colin Fraser asked &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GPT&lt;/span&gt; for a random noun&lt;/a&gt; and it returned &amp;#8220;Pineapple&amp;#8221; 11% of the&amp;nbsp;time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cool thing with something like name generation is that it can create punny combinations, like &lt;em&gt;Sage Pepper&lt;/em&gt; for a cook, and other less obvious names that still rhyme with the spirit of the&amp;nbsp;character.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But sometimes we don&amp;#8217;t want randomness so much as &lt;em&gt;distribution&lt;/em&gt;. It&amp;#8217;s not to say that we only ever want one distribution, but just a conscious explicit&amp;nbsp;distribution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also there should only be one, or at least no more than a couple &amp;#8220;best cooks&amp;#8221;. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GPT&lt;/span&gt; isn&amp;#8217;t the only one who is drawn to hyperbole, so it&amp;#8217;s fine if some things are overstated, but you can&amp;#8217;t make every character exceptional. You can still make every character unique! But you need to make them unique on a variety of&amp;nbsp;spectrums.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m not quite sure how to resolve this. Maybe pre-roll some core things and then seed the prompts with the results. But I don&amp;#8217;t have any clear answer for the&amp;nbsp;hyperbole.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span id="people-context"&gt;People existing in and out of a&amp;nbsp;context&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of the hierarchical composition process all people &amp;#8220;belong&amp;#8221;&amp;nbsp;somewhere:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Factions have faction members. Faction members are created specifically in the context of their one&amp;nbsp;faction.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Buildings have occupants. The person is built to occupy a&amp;nbsp;building.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Plots can add new characters that serve a purpose in the&amp;nbsp;plot.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An alternative might be to create a pool of people and then assign them, adjusting descriptions to fit their new home. Maybe that would be better, but I think giving &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GPT&lt;/span&gt; the freedom to create characters for a specific purpose is the right&amp;nbsp;choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it&amp;#8217;s not the right choice that it ends there. A few&amp;nbsp;problems:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;People don&amp;#8217;t relate to each other. When &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GPT&lt;/span&gt; creates a single list of characters it can and does relate them sometimes, for instance introducing a leader and an assistant. But that&amp;#8217;s just an accidental feature. &lt;em&gt;Density of narrative&lt;/em&gt; is a feature that&amp;#8217;s missing from this process, there aren&amp;#8217;t enough loops, enough serendipitous relationships. Even in a large city you should keep bumping into the same people for different reasons. That might not be realistic but it&amp;#8217;s &lt;em&gt;enjoyable&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There&amp;#8217;s no one schema for people. People in buildings have a property that relates them to the building (like a job). People in factions have a role. &amp;#8220;Protagonists&amp;#8221; (narrative free agents) have a heroic archetype. I don&amp;#8217;t think we want to overspecify people and demand that all attributes be filled in, but it makes the coding harder when each character is only&amp;nbsp;half-filled-out.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/dustinfreeman"&gt;Dustin Freeman&lt;/a&gt; gave me the idea of doing this as a kind of fix-up: generate a cast of fully situated characters, but then start to add new properties and relationships. I&amp;#8217;m imagining something&amp;nbsp;like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create a list of characters. If there&amp;#8217;s too many for &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GPT&lt;/span&gt; to process then just sample a few&amp;nbsp;randomly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ask &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GPT&lt;/span&gt; to suggest the basic outline of some relationships. E.g., &amp;#8220;Tom and Eileen are brother and sister&amp;#8221;. Let &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GPT&lt;/span&gt; pick and choose who to match. Maybe the author selects which relationships to keep, or maybe they just scan and mass&amp;nbsp;accept.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Represent the relationship formally&amp;nbsp;somewhere.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Go back to each person and rewrite their description to include the&amp;nbsp;relationship.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This could also be done with characters and factions (so building occupants can belong to factions, factions can own buildings, or people can belong to two&amp;nbsp;factions).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve done something like this experimenting with &amp;#8220;faction relationships&amp;#8221; (like, inter-faction squabbles) but it falls flat, usually explaining obvious tensions between factions. Maybe I&amp;#8217;m doing it wrong, or maybe there&amp;#8217;s not enough material in that particular combination. (Maybe I need to focus on inter-factional &lt;em&gt;histories&lt;/em&gt; instead of &lt;em&gt;relationships&lt;/em&gt;?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span id="gpt-3-4"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;GPT&lt;/span&gt; 3.5 vs &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GPT&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tool is built to default to use &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GPT&lt;/span&gt;-3.5 (the gpt-3.5-turbo &lt;span class="caps"&gt;API&lt;/span&gt;) for all requests. Lots of people are jumping on &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GPT&lt;/span&gt;-4, and I&amp;#8217;ve now done some work with both, including places where 3.5 definitely wasn&amp;#8217;t sufficient for the task. But here I&amp;#8217;m quite happy with &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GPT&lt;/span&gt;-3.5.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My general intuition is that &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GPT&lt;/span&gt;-4 is able to connect information across greater distances and to simultaneously follow a larger number of directions. This does come up, instructions can get lost as they accumulate. I think there&amp;#8217;s ways to solve that with 3.5, such as refining generic/universal instructions to just those applicable to certain domains. For instance some instructions only apply to buildings (like building material), others only to character generation (like demographics) and so&amp;nbsp;on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The overall development pattern for &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GPT&lt;/span&gt;-4 might also be different than 3.5. There&amp;#8217;s a lot of architecture that is there implicitly to keep down the size of any one prompt and response. With &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GPT&lt;/span&gt;-4 it may be possible to accomplish much more in one prompt, both because of a greater confidence in the output and because it&amp;#8217;s able to handle more complexity in the&amp;nbsp;request.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That said, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GPT&lt;/span&gt;-3.5 is pretty great and I&amp;#8217;m reluctant to just switch to something that&amp;#8217;s&amp;nbsp;bigger/better/slower/more-expensive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;span id="declarative"&gt;A declarative approach to&amp;nbsp;building&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inside the spaghetti code of City Maker was a much simpler idea waiting to come out, and this version is a complete rewrite of the previous code. I gave it the name &lt;a href="https://llm.ianbicking.org/layercraft/"&gt;LayerCraft&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href="https://github.com/ianb/llm-garden/blob/main/src/layercraft/citymakerschema.js"&gt;City Maker as a schema&lt;/a&gt;. I don&amp;#8217;t know yet how widely applicable this approach is, but it feels like it&amp;#8217;s touching on patterns will be relevant for&amp;nbsp;LLMs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ll try to explain it concretely using a&amp;nbsp;city:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There&amp;#8217;s many properties: name, factions, people, neighborhoods,&amp;nbsp;buildings&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some properties belong to others in a parent/child relationship, like buildings that belong to&amp;nbsp;neighborhoods&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For any property &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GPT&lt;/span&gt; can generate &lt;em&gt;options&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Generating these options requires a prompt; these prompts usually require context which creates &lt;em&gt;dependencies&lt;/em&gt;. The prompts themselves are templates, dependencies are the substitution&amp;nbsp;variables&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Once a prompt can be fulfilled &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GPT&lt;/span&gt; is immediately asked about it, the author can make choices, commit choices, and thus produce new properties ready to be filled&amp;nbsp;out&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In practice for the City Maker this means you choose a theme for your city, then backstory, then you pick out some neighborhood types that are created based on that background, and so&amp;nbsp;on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The prompts themselves are constructed to elicit the best result from &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GPT&lt;/span&gt;. Good&amp;nbsp;prompts:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Give the necessary context without giving too much distracting&amp;nbsp;context&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Show concrete examples that neither over-specify nor under-specify the desired&amp;nbsp;results&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Give &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GPT&lt;/span&gt; broad guidance (&amp;#8220;exciting&amp;#8221;, &amp;#8220;simple&amp;#8221;,&amp;nbsp;etc)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Identify the schema for the&amp;nbsp;results&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For instance, the schema for building&amp;nbsp;occupants:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;The city $cityName that is $cityType, $cityPeriod. $cityBackstory

A list of $building.jobTypes and other inhabitants for $building ($building.description). Give each person an interesting and culturally appropriate name and a colorful background and personality. Include negative attributes.

Respond with a JSON list like:

[
  {
    type: $building.jobTypes|first|repr|json, // Or $building.jobTypes|rest
    name: &amp;quot;FirstName LastName&amp;quot;,
    description: &amp;quot;[a description of the person, their profession or role, their personality, their history]&amp;quot;,
    age: 30, // age in years, 5-100
    arrives: &amp;quot;8am&amp;quot;,
    leaves: &amp;quot;6pm&amp;quot;,
  }
]
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The building schema includes &lt;code&gt;jobTypes&lt;/code&gt; which informs the example. The prompt &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; just offer some generic advice, but I&amp;#8217;ve found there&amp;#8217;s often an advantage in establishing options as part of the&amp;nbsp;context.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The particular implementation of this in LayerCraft isn&amp;#8217;t half as general as this needs to be, but I&amp;#8217;m very optimistic about the&amp;nbsp;approach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span id="updates-dependencies"&gt;Updates and&amp;nbsp;dependencies&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Building up incrementally gives steering power to the author, but not correction. This is a common problem in the authoring process because it&amp;#8217;s hard to know the results of some of those early choices until you&amp;#8217;ve seen what they&amp;#8217;ve produced. And if you are creating dozens of characters based on these prompts you might not see the problems until you are halfway&amp;nbsp;in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we treated this process as a pure question of dependencies, and treated the schema-defined graph like a Makefile, then changing early choices would simply regenerate later choices. But the author probably liked many of those&amp;nbsp;choices!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an example: I created a candy city. Part way through I realized it would be more fun if the characters were each made of candy. I didn&amp;#8217;t really want to change everyone&amp;#8217;s role, but only to make sure each description said what kind of candy the person was. I added an instruction to the backstory: &amp;#8220;the people of Gummytown are made out of candy, with some being gummies, others being chocolates, and a few being marshmallows or candy canes. For each person specify what kind of candy they are in their&amp;nbsp;description.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How do you tell which properties this applies to? How do you apply this change to those properties? &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GPT&lt;/span&gt; is capable of both of these things, but not in a deterministic or entirely reliable way. Fixing this is significant work and definitely needs to be present in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UI&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span id="meta-prompting"&gt;Getting meta in the&amp;nbsp;prompt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The use of context (such as backstory) lets the author broadly control what&amp;#8217;s being created, but it&amp;#8217;s often underpowered. It also can&amp;#8217;t change the &lt;em&gt;shape&lt;/em&gt; of what&amp;#8217;s returned, such as adding a new property to a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;JSON&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can do a lot with &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GPT&lt;/span&gt; prompts and concatenation. That is, you can &amp;#8220;edit&amp;#8221; a prompt by just adding more instructions. If those instructions conflict then &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GPT&lt;/span&gt; will try its best. This is usually enough, and why this entire approach&amp;nbsp;works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an example where this worked: I added the request &amp;#8220;describe each person&amp;#8217;s mask&amp;#8221; to Veilvale person creation. It listened and consistently did so. But when I tried to give the instruction: &amp;#8220;make it a list of automatons&amp;#8221; it balked, confused by a previous instruction which clearly asked for &lt;em&gt;people&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;automatons are not people&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A next level is to put more of the core prompt material into properties. Yet the text of those prompt templates quickly turns into programming itself, a mode switch that&amp;#8217;s hard even for a programmer if you aren&amp;#8217;t in the driving&amp;nbsp;seat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we turn back to &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GPT&lt;/span&gt; again to solve this we&amp;#8217;ll need meta-prompts: descriptions of what the prompt needs to accomplish, and its constraints, so that &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GPT&lt;/span&gt; can apply natural-language edits to the prompts while maintaining the required&amp;nbsp;structure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span id="planning"&gt;Planning &lt;span class="amp"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;action&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While this is author-focused, I think the choices that &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GPT&lt;/span&gt; produces should be thought of as &lt;em&gt;proposed plans&lt;/em&gt;. In City Maker it&amp;#8217;s offering plans for how to build out a world. The author chooses options (and edits and makes notes on options) to guide, correct, and expand on what &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GPT&lt;/span&gt; produces on its&amp;nbsp;own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GPT&lt;/span&gt; was producing code instead of options that&amp;#8217;s also a plan. Sometimes you can build plans on plans, i.e., build more code just by looking at existing code. But often you need the output of that code to keep going. Or you need feedback, refinement, etc. I think there could be a&amp;nbsp;pattern:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The author &lt;em&gt;specifies&lt;/em&gt; the&amp;nbsp;goal&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;GPT&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;proposes&lt;/em&gt; up to the limits of that&amp;nbsp;specification&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The author &lt;em&gt;previews the&amp;nbsp;results&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The author &lt;em&gt;adjusts, selects, refines&lt;/em&gt; the results, perhaps through choice, through dialog (chat), refined specification,&amp;nbsp;etc&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The choices are &lt;em&gt;committed&lt;/em&gt;, expanding the&amp;nbsp;specification&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Any unresolved actions can be taken, code run, output collected,&amp;nbsp;etc&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Repeat at&amp;nbsp;2&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately this doesn&amp;#8217;t cover revision, as mentioned in the previous section, and I don&amp;#8217;t know exactly what adding that to the loop would look&amp;nbsp;like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span id="fine-tuning"&gt;I&amp;#8217;m glad fine tuning is dead (for like a&amp;nbsp;month)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s tempting with these problems to think about &amp;#8220;fine tuning&amp;#8221; a model. That&amp;#8217;s how &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AI&lt;/span&gt; has worked for a long time, and it feels like a good way to approach issues with reliability or ever-growing prompts that keep adding little instructions and&amp;nbsp;caveats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For now the fine-tuning option is off the table if you are using the gpt-3.5-turbo (what this uses) or gpt-4 APIs, which are chat-based and offer no finetuning. This probably won&amp;#8217;t last for long, but &lt;em&gt;right now&lt;/em&gt; you&amp;#8217;ll almost always get better (cheaper, faster, more flexible) results by using these new models and forgoing fine&amp;nbsp;tuning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the future I want to see! Everything I&amp;#8217;ve described here &lt;em&gt;is not compatible with fine tuning&lt;/em&gt;. You can&amp;#8217;t edit prompts and make sophisticated adjustments when the instructions are in the tuned model&amp;nbsp;weights!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prompting is artisanal &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AI&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. If you know something about a subject, and want to use that knowledge and your own sweat to iterate on a prompt, there is tremendous potential in prompt design. Prompt design isn&amp;#8217;t enough right now because tooling is still limited, but prompt-focused tools can give people new agency on a very individual level. I&amp;#8217;m developing both sides of LayerCraft (the tool and the prompts) and I still feel empowered by this&amp;nbsp;abstraction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When proposing prompt-focused functionality lots of people are all like &lt;em&gt;blah blah blah, what about a moat, how do you differentiate yourself?&lt;/em&gt; It&amp;#8217;s so self centered&amp;#8230; there&amp;#8217;s a kind of thought that is addicted to consuming people rather than empowering them. Empowered people don&amp;#8217;t lay down and play the part of being your&amp;nbsp;moat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;span id="conclusion"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s hard to conclude this because this is just one step along the way. (To where?) Some things that stand out to&amp;nbsp;me:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;GPT&lt;/span&gt; prompts matter. It&amp;#8217;s not just a matter of getting the prompt &amp;#8220;right,&amp;#8221; it&amp;#8217;s iteration and exploration over a specific&amp;nbsp;domain.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When a user can enter text to affect a prompt they are also prompt engineering, and that&amp;#8217;s the magic of this&amp;nbsp;technology.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;These same things are true for image prompts, but without the complexity of recursively applying output to future&amp;nbsp;inputs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Natural language is now a data structure. We&amp;#8217;re probably all going to struggle to internalize this for a&amp;nbsp;while.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Steerability makes &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GPT&lt;/span&gt; a lot more fun than just gazing at its wise&amp;nbsp;output.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Chat is not the only way to interact with &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GPT&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

If you are curious about the exact prompts look in &lt;a href="https://github.com/ianb/llm-garden/blob/main/src/layercraft/citymakerschema.js"&gt;citymakerschema.js&lt;/a&gt;. Note that this is a personal project, it&amp;#8217;s built for personal&amp;nbsp;exploration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly: when using the site be warned I have not built it carefully for other people to use, stuff will be weird, errors will appear only in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;JS&lt;/span&gt; Console, there are no promises. And you&amp;#8217;ll have to bring your own &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GPT&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;API&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;key!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This post is for people who are interested in building interactive tools on top of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GPT&lt;/span&gt; and want to see some of the things I&amp;#8217;ve encountered and what I&amp;#8217;ve found that is successful and what is still a&amp;nbsp;challenge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; Also check out my followup post: &lt;a href="https://ianbicking.org/blog/2023/04/world-building-gpt-2-declarative.html"&gt;World Building with &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GPT&lt;/span&gt; part 2: bigger, better, more&amp;nbsp;declarative&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Where it&amp;nbsp;started&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I enjoy game worlds where the world seems alive and the details suggest a backstory. The real world both is and isn&amp;#8217;t this way: every house has stories, people invested in its details, each building is occupied and reoccupied repeatedly. But our world is also quiet, private, less eccentric than we might want, and imaginary worlds can be fun. Procedurally generated roguelike games give some of the excitement of exploration but lack story and depth. A game like Stardew Valley has stories but is necessarily pretty small and&amp;nbsp;static.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With generative &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AI&lt;/span&gt; we can change these trade-offs! Is it possible to make a big world that is both eclectic and consistent? Can it include story and personality? I don&amp;#8217;t know the answer, but I&amp;#8217;d like to share what I&amp;#8217;ve&amp;nbsp;got&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;The&amp;nbsp;tool&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;aside&gt;(Sidebar is for concrete examples)&lt;/aside&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a previous experiment in story building I used a step-by-step approach: generate the first passage, generate a next passage, etc. That&amp;#8217;s appealing and simple but leads to a wandering and unstructured narrative. I believe in both stories and worlds we want a kind of fractal complexity: at each scale we want most things to be &amp;#8220;typical&amp;#8221; but also some surprise. In a story the surprises might go from large to small scale like: an unusual character arc, a surprise plot development, an alternate perspective, an unexpected response in dialog, a perceptive detail in a description, and an unusual word in a sentence. If you always write the-most-likely-next-thing then it&amp;#8217;ll be boring. If you only write surprises then there&amp;#8217;s nothing to even be surprised&amp;nbsp;about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly we want to build a world or city that expresses a broad theme and consistency, but also has diversity and surprises throughout it. To do this I&amp;#8217;ve approached the building&amp;nbsp;hierarchically:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Establish the type of city (medieval, fantasy, noir, etc). Give it a name and some&amp;nbsp;story.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Identify distinct&amp;nbsp;neighborhoods.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create buildings in those&amp;nbsp;neighborhoods.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create people associated with the&amp;nbsp;buildings.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Populate the buildings with rooms, furniture, and&amp;nbsp;objects.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are problems with this approach that I&amp;#8217;ll touch on later, but it&amp;#8217;s a&amp;nbsp;start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can see it in action&amp;nbsp;here:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe style="width: 100%; aspect-ratio: 16/9; display: block" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YUEXo3wrf70" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;What&amp;nbsp;works?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some stuff I really&amp;nbsp;like&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;GPT&lt;/span&gt;-generated&amp;nbsp;lists&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;aside&gt;Examples of city theme suggestions:
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;A sci-fi city on Mars with interplanetary&amp;nbsp;trade&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A space station orbiting&amp;nbsp;Earth&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A Muslim city with a vast&amp;nbsp;bazaar&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A magical kingdom with a cursed&amp;nbsp;castle&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A pirate-infested Caribbean port&amp;nbsp;city&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An Aztec city hidden in a remote&amp;nbsp;jungle&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;GPT&lt;/span&gt; is good at coming up with lists: lists of city types, names, people. As I used the tool more I started to have my own opinions on what I wanted to make, but those lists were an important part of expanding my own imagination. I&amp;#8217;ve made &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nsIPC_eqfwg"&gt;other experiments&lt;/a&gt; where I filled in all the initial information by hand without any &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GPT&lt;/span&gt; suggestions, and I miss the&amp;nbsp;lists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Natural language&amp;nbsp;context&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;aside&gt;Example backstory suggestions for a jungle city:
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The economy of Xochiciahuatl revolves around agriculture, fishing, and crafts such as pottery and&amp;nbsp;textiles.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The geography of the city boasts dense jungle, mountainous terrain, and a valley basin surrounding an expansive&amp;nbsp;lake.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The level of technology present in the city is quite advanced, with aqueducts, terraced gardens, and even a canal&amp;nbsp;network.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The cultural context of Xochiciahuatl is multifaceted, with influences from indigenous tribes, the Spanish, and African&amp;nbsp;slaves.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cities are formed in a top-down way, and all the top layers (city, backstory, neighborhood) are purely context. The top layer descriptions are very important but have no need for structure, it&amp;#8217;s all just language. Not every aspect has to be enumerated, just the ones that seem important for this&amp;nbsp;city.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Reinforcing city&amp;nbsp;character&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;aside&gt;Example neighborhood suggestions for a space station:
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Gateway: The Gateway is the official entrance to Aeterna Station. It is a grand, soaring structure that serves as a reminder of the city&amp;#8217;s ambition and&amp;nbsp;capability.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Solaria: Located in the “sunshine zone,” Solaria is where the people of Aeterna Station can find some of the best dining and entertainment in the city. It is a great place to relax and enjoy the view of Earth&amp;nbsp;below.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Agri-Plex: The Agri-Plex is a large, domed area devoted to growing food and other crops. It provides the citizens of Aeterna Station with the necessary&amp;nbsp;sustenance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stabilization Zone: This is the area where the station&amp;#8217;s mechanical infrastructure is maintained. Regularly monitored and kept running at peak efficiency, the Stabilization Zone is vital for keeping the station operating&amp;nbsp;smoothly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A general character to the city (e.g., &amp;#8220;fantasy city&amp;#8221;) isn&amp;#8217;t enough to build something consistent. The character of the city needs to be repeated and reinforced at different levels. Details like architecture and building materials may have to be&amp;nbsp;specified.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is primarily done at the neighborhood level, though it would benefit from building-specific attributes more strongly informing person generation. For instance in a fantasy city it&amp;#8217;s common that everyone will start out powerful and loyal and wise, even when they occupy a hovel or explicitly partake in the dark&amp;nbsp;arts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Structured&amp;nbsp;output&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;aside&gt;
Structure of a building:
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;strong&gt;name:&lt;/strong&gt; Goblin Smithy&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;description:&lt;/strong&gt; A small, smoky workshop where Goblin tradesmen craft magical weapons and armor&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;floors:&lt;/strong&gt; 1&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;widthInMeters:&lt;/strong&gt; 4&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;depthInMeters:&lt;/strong&gt; 4&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we get to parts with specific structure it&amp;#8217;s a comfortable transition. Buildings have sizes, people have roles, etc. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GPT&lt;/span&gt; can fill in these details. If you wanted to plug the city into a map builder or other structured game format, you can produce the metaata you&amp;nbsp;need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Filling out content you&amp;nbsp;create&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;aside&gt;In response to &amp;#8220;a whimsical factory for magical robots. Give it a fun name and description&amp;#8221;:
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;strong&gt;name:&lt;/strong&gt; The Clockwork Dream factory&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;description:&lt;/strong&gt; This magical factory is a bustling center of activity where magical robots are assembled and activated for a variety of tasks. Powered by an array of enchantments, the whirring machines churn out a steady supply of dream-like robots that fill the city with a sense of cheerful industry. Acrid smoke rises from the chimneys as the robotic workers tirelessly toil away, overseen by a crew of diligent engineers.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;floors:&lt;/strong&gt; 4&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;widthInMeters:&lt;/strong&gt; 10&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;depthInMeters:&lt;/strong&gt; 10&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you don&amp;#8217;t want to take a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GPT&lt;/span&gt; suggestion, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GPT&lt;/span&gt; is pretty good at filling in the details in something you produce. So if you ask for a &amp;#8220;factory&amp;#8221; it works well for &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GPT&lt;/span&gt; to turn that into a fuller description, size,&amp;nbsp;etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I only implemented this for structured elements, and not freeform fields like neighborhood descriptions. I should fix&amp;nbsp;that!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Pushing &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GPT&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;helps&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;aside&gt;First suggestions of furniture for an &lt;em&gt;Activation Chamber&lt;/em&gt; in the Clockwork Dream factory, where robots are granted power:
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Activation&amp;nbsp;Table&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Alchemy&amp;nbsp;Cauldron&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Arcane&amp;nbsp;Anvil&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
Kind of boring; adding &amp;#8220;weird steampunk-inspired machines for giving robots a soul&amp;#8221; to the prompt:
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Tin Man Activator: This machine is a steampunk-inspired machine for giving robots a soul. In the center is a glowing magical orb that emits strange and mysterious magical energies. &lt;em&gt;[Lost points for copying my&amp;nbsp;language!]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Alchemical Hammer of Life: This contraption is an alchemical hammer with a large hammerhead and a magical gemstone set in the top. A switch activates the powerful device, granting a spark of life to any robotic body that is placed beneath&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Small contextual prompt additions can be helpful. For instance &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GPT&lt;/span&gt; has sometimes wanted to suggest sofas and armchairs for a factory, but a small note (&amp;#8220;factory equipment and tools&amp;#8221;) can fix&amp;nbsp;that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;However&lt;/strong&gt; I&amp;#8217;ve found this needed too often for character descriptions. The descriptions start out seeming &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OK&lt;/span&gt; but begin to feel boring and repetitious. The building and neighborhood need to more explicitly affect the people prompt. Right now the prompt is&amp;nbsp;effectively:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;[General city context]&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br/&gt; A list of owners, caretakers, residents, tenants, and other inhabitants for &lt;strong&gt;[Building Name]&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;strong&gt;[Building Description]&lt;/strong&gt;) Give each person an interesting and culturally appropriate name and a colorful background and&amp;nbsp;personality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you ask a more open-ended question&amp;nbsp;like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Make a numbered list of the kinds of people that would occupy a building called &lt;strong&gt;[Building Name]&lt;/strong&gt; described as: &lt;strong&gt;[Building&amp;nbsp;Description]&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;then you get a good list of professions and roles (better than my hardcoded set). If you add&amp;nbsp;this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For each item include a 10-word note on the likely personality, limitations, and character&amp;nbsp;flaws&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;then you also start battling the relentless positivity, with results like &amp;#8220;Supply Chain Managers: Responsible and knowledgeable, but prone to micromanaging&amp;#8221; and &amp;#8220;Magical Robots: Resourceful and imaginative, but restricted by&amp;nbsp;programming&amp;#8221;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Note: after writing this I implemented a list of jobs/roles as part of buildings; it was&amp;nbsp;effective!]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Putting people in buildings is&amp;nbsp;great&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For all my criticisms in the previous section, adding people is great and I only want it to be better! Buildings have some history and personality, but the people associated with them make it seem much more&amp;nbsp;alive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Razzaqua Sephina&lt;/strong&gt;: Razzaqua Sephina is the mysterious and enigmatic owner of the Warehouse of the Cankered Crypt. She is a master at thaumaturgy, specializing in curses and dark artifacts. Those who have met her say she is as cold as ice. Despite this, locals claim she is fiercely loyal and protective of her&amp;nbsp;tenants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kana Wazri&lt;/strong&gt;: Kana is a charming young student from a well-known family of merchants. She has a great love of magic but isn&amp;#8217;t incredibly talented at it. Despite this, she is always seen studying and researching the magical arts, hoping to one day unlock her true&amp;nbsp;potential.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Morgaine de Sombra&lt;/strong&gt;: Morgaine de Sombra was an aristocrat in the court of King Tragen before she found her calling in the dark arts. She runs a tight ship, instilling a sense of discipline among the students of the Academy. Morgaine has a no-nonsense attitude when it comes to teaching and is feared by many of the&amp;nbsp;students.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fayza Silverwing&lt;/strong&gt;: Fayza is a beautiful priestess, wearing a dress of shimmering pearlescent feathers. She is gentle and kind, and her voice is melodious and soothing. She uses her singing voice to call down the blessings of the sky goddess, and to ward off evil. She also tends to the birds of the temple, providing them with a special place to&amp;nbsp;dwell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mathilde Velasquez&lt;/strong&gt;: Mathilde Velasquez was a cunning and ambitious woman in life, a talented emissary and negotiator. She was the right hand of an 18th century nobleman, and in death, she still roams the halls of the Mansion, planning out her strategies and scheming her way through the&amp;nbsp;afterlife.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had to nudge some of these into existence, but I&amp;#8217;m still quite enamored with the variety it can produce, and believe &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GPT&lt;/span&gt; can do much better with further&amp;nbsp;refinement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;What doesn&amp;#8217;t&amp;nbsp;work?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think these things could be fixed, but they aren&amp;#8217;t yet, and if you implement something similar you are likely to encounter these same&amp;nbsp;problems:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Reverting to&amp;nbsp;normal/boring&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;GPT&lt;/span&gt; is constantly normalizing things, including modernization. I want to make weird stuff, but also stylistically consistent&amp;nbsp;stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a general rule asking &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GPT&lt;/span&gt; for a list will help it be more creative. But when it gets on a roll producing normal/boring things, it will fill out the list with normal/boring&amp;nbsp;things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Examples of this: &amp;#8220;smart homes&amp;#8221; (there is no time when I want &amp;#8220;smart homes&amp;#8221;), lots of references to tourism, &amp;#8220;high-end restaurants&amp;#8221;. How many cities should have art galleries? The primary attribute of a harbor area is not its historic cobbled streets and tourist amenities. These are all examples where &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GPT&lt;/span&gt; introduces a modern&amp;nbsp;perspective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;GPT&lt;/span&gt; is desperately&amp;nbsp;positive&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;aside&gt;
Some characters; note the pattern:
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Anavel Shaz: a powerful alchemist and&amp;nbsp;scholar&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lalania Nightshadow: A powerful sorceress and former Keeper of the Order of&amp;nbsp;Magi&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Brynja Rahman: a talented enchantress whose skill is&amp;nbsp;unrivaled&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every building is grand. Every character is loyal and helpful. Every character is competent, respected, and&amp;nbsp;wise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you ask very explicitly for flaws you can get &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt;. It&amp;#8217;s very hard to get a truly despicable character. It&amp;#8217;s hard to even get a realistically boring character, one who is not very competent or smart. It&amp;#8217;s a fight, but armed with prompts we can still win the&amp;nbsp;battle!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some things that have&amp;nbsp;helped:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Asking for &amp;#8220;exotic names&amp;#8221;: this seems to result in a wide variety of ethnic names and other interesting combinations. For any one list &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GPT&lt;/span&gt; will often choose one ethnicity, such as Arabic names or Japanese&amp;nbsp;names.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;Colorful background/history&amp;#8221;: this adds some&amp;nbsp;playfulness&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mentioning &amp;#8220;culture&amp;#8221;: this seems to fight against normalizing to modern American&amp;nbsp;themes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Asking for &amp;#8220;personality&amp;#8221; or &amp;#8220;character&amp;#8221; in something: similar to &amp;#8220;colorful&amp;#8221;, this also tends to extend the&amp;nbsp;descriptions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ask for &amp;#8220;negative attributes&amp;#8221;, &amp;#8220;flaws&amp;#8221;, &amp;#8220;Achilles Heal&amp;#8221;: descriptions will still be positive, but you&amp;#8217;ll get some additional negative&amp;nbsp;attributes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Fine detail is too much&amp;nbsp;work&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you generate a building and occupants you also have an opportunity to build rooms, to put furniture in those rooms, to put items in those rooms, and finally to define the room connections. This takes forever and is very&amp;nbsp;boring!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many rooms have tables! Many buildings have a storage room! Many kitchens have&amp;nbsp;utensils!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To generate real maps you do need these more concrete features. A building with no interior is no fun. An interior with no objects is no&amp;nbsp;fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I were to approach this again I&amp;#8217;d use this&amp;nbsp;strategy:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ask &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GPT&lt;/span&gt; for building &amp;#8220;types&amp;#8221; when creating a building. Maybe offer some initial types, but also invite &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GPT&lt;/span&gt; to make up new&amp;nbsp;types.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For each type of building ask &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GPT&lt;/span&gt; to create an expansive list of rooms. Give the rooms types as well (hang-out, cooking, storage, etc). Ask for a range of room&amp;nbsp;sizes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For each type of room, or perhaps building-type/room-type combos, ask about furniture and items. Again ask for a long and expansive&amp;nbsp;list.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point you could use a simple non-&lt;span class="caps"&gt;GPT&lt;/span&gt; algorithm to assign rooms to buildings. But you could also use abbreviated forms of these list and ask for &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GPT&lt;/span&gt; to fill out a building,&amp;nbsp;like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The building is called &amp;#8220;&lt;strong&gt;[Building Name&lt;/strong&gt;]&amp;#8221; and is described as: &lt;strong&gt;[Building Description]&lt;/strong&gt;
Fill out this&amp;nbsp;list:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;[Room type]&lt;/strong&gt;:&amp;nbsp;[description]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;[Furniture]&lt;/strong&gt;:&amp;nbsp;[description]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8230; basically letting &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GPT&lt;/span&gt; customize the building in one step, given a randomly chosen set of specific&amp;nbsp;elements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Bad spatial&amp;nbsp;reasoning&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;GPT&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;s spatial reasoning isn&amp;#8217;t very good (unsurprisingly). It&amp;#8217;s &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OK&lt;/span&gt; at general sizes and heights of buildings, but when it has to relate spaces to each other (like placing rooms in buildings) it doesn&amp;#8217;t&amp;nbsp;understand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This probably calls for traditional procedural generation&amp;nbsp;techniques.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s possible that &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GPT&lt;/span&gt; could help by coming up with constraints. For instance when generating rooms &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GPT&lt;/span&gt; is asked if the room is &amp;#8220;public&amp;#8221;, &amp;#8220;private&amp;#8221; (impolite to enter), &amp;#8220;secure&amp;#8221; (locked), or &amp;#8220;secret&amp;#8221;. These hints could provide constraints that keep the room layouts&amp;nbsp;plausible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Every detail of a prompt is a&amp;nbsp;suggestion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s very hard to tell &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GPT&lt;/span&gt; what is important and what is just framing. Some&amp;nbsp;examples:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In an early prompt I used an example like &lt;code&gt;{name: "John Doe"}&lt;/code&gt; for generating a person. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GPT&lt;/span&gt; started coming up with names like &amp;#8220;Jack Doe&amp;#8221;, &amp;#8220;John Smith&amp;#8221; etc., &lt;em&gt;specifically&lt;/em&gt; choosing stereotypically generic names. I was able to improve it with a combination of asking for &amp;#8220;interesting and culturally appropriate names&amp;#8221; and replacing the example with &lt;code&gt;{name: "FirstName LastName"}&lt;/code&gt;. (But now every so often &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GPT&lt;/span&gt; spits out FirstName LastName characters; you can&amp;#8217;t win them&amp;nbsp;all.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Even a word like &amp;#8220;building&amp;#8221; is a suggestion. I wanted to make a floating pirate city made up of attached boats. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GPT&lt;/span&gt; wasn&amp;#8217;t sure whether to make things that matched my city description, or that matched what a &amp;#8220;building&amp;#8221; typically is, and it suggested a lot of boat-inappropriate structures. Explicit prompt additions can help, but it would be even better if some of the core language could be&amp;nbsp;substituted.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My beaver city also featured far too few dams and dens. Which is too bad because &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GPT&lt;/span&gt; is quite good at helping fill out these weird combinations so long as the prompt doesn&amp;#8217;t fight with the&amp;nbsp;premise.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can imagine having &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GPT&lt;/span&gt; rewrite some of the prompts as the city starts to be&amp;nbsp;defined.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another option is to have a glossary of terms where the author can adjust a few terms. I&amp;#8217;ve specifically allowed the word &amp;#8220;neighborhood&amp;#8221; to be substituted (for quarter/district/etc), though the effect is minimal and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GPT&lt;/span&gt; is happy to use different terms for neighborhoods without any special suggestions. Maybe other words are more&amp;nbsp;impactful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Constantly poking at the prompts is&amp;nbsp;tiresome&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;aside&gt;Notes I added for &lt;a href="https://llm.ianbicking.org/citymaker/?name=builtin_talamora"&gt;Talamora&lt;/a&gt;:
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;include a both haunted/ghost district and a desolate magically polluted&amp;nbsp;district&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;include lots of magical finance and investment, as well as dark and occult&amp;nbsp;elements&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;include different schools of magic: nature, clairvoyance, battle magic, golems; give each an imaginative&amp;nbsp;name&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;include a list of temples for many&amp;nbsp;gods&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;include haunted buildings with dark&amp;nbsp;histories&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;include a list of different fraternal orders of magicians from different magical&amp;nbsp;schools&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Include lists of ruins with specific and mind-bending dangers due to the magical&amp;nbsp;pollution&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GPT&lt;/span&gt; just doesn&amp;#8217;t come up with the right things at all. When that happens there&amp;#8217;s a few ways to get &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GPT&lt;/span&gt; to change its output: adding or changing the overall context/backstory, making suggestions for a specific list, and asking for specific&amp;nbsp;items.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Getting fun, interesting, and varied entities requires lots of nudging and iteration. But there&amp;#8217;s not many ways to build up those notes. You can add the notes to the global context, and that can be a good idea, but it&amp;#8217;s not a good iteration&amp;nbsp;process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have a hunch there&amp;#8217;s a way to experiment when creating specific buildings/etc, and then use &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GPT&lt;/span&gt; itself to percolate that up into more general prompt changes. But it&amp;#8217;s only a&amp;nbsp;hunch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Hallucinating&amp;nbsp;metadata&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;GPT&lt;/span&gt; will hallucinate metadata. This is both a problem and an&amp;nbsp;opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to turn the output into structured data for another program you might find it annoying when it uses &lt;code&gt;{size: "6x10"}&lt;/code&gt; instead of &lt;code&gt;{widthInMeters: 6, depthInMeters: 10}&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More often it&amp;#8217;s actually interesting metadata that you might want to use more widely. For&amp;nbsp;instance:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;name:&lt;/strong&gt; The Cabal Of Witches &lt;br/&gt; &lt;strong&gt;hierarchy:&lt;/strong&gt; Grand Witch -&amp;gt; Witch -&amp;gt; Apprentice -&amp;gt; Initiate &lt;br/&gt; &lt;strong&gt;initiates:&lt;/strong&gt; Keeper of the Dark Art, Spiritualists, Alchemists,&amp;nbsp;Shaman&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;name:&lt;/strong&gt; The Circle of Mages &lt;br/&gt; &lt;strong&gt;hierarchy:&lt;/strong&gt; Grand Magus -&amp;gt; Magus -&amp;gt; Apprentice -&amp;gt; Initiate &lt;br/&gt; &lt;strong&gt;initiates:&lt;/strong&gt; Evokers, Enchanters, Abjurers,&amp;nbsp;Illusionists&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;name:&lt;/strong&gt; Abandoned Warehouse &lt;br/&gt; &lt;strong&gt;dangers:&lt;/strong&gt; magically-altered creatures, unknown chemical pollutants, trapdoors and hidden&amp;nbsp;passages&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems odd to produce this metadata when presumably nothing is ready to consume it. But these attributes elicit responses from &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GPT&lt;/span&gt;, and do so more consistently than natural language&amp;nbsp;requests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adding this metadata gives &lt;strong&gt;theme&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;variation&lt;/strong&gt;. The attribute is the theme, the value is the variation. This makes the set of things you&amp;#8217;ve created more comprehensible, with a structure that makes it easier to appreciate the&amp;nbsp;variety.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#8217;t know how to expose this! Should we ask &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GPT&lt;/span&gt; to brainstorm attributes ahead of time? Invite it to hallucinate more widely and then the author picks the ones they like to become part of the prompts? Then&amp;#8230;&amp;nbsp;backfill?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Corruption and&amp;nbsp;fixation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the magic of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GPT&lt;/span&gt; is how it implicitly learns from context. Often it learns the wrong thing. This is particularly noticeable in ChatGPT, where it will often fixate on something despite or even because of&amp;nbsp;corrections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This tool is much more explicit about context and doesn&amp;#8217;t have anything that is specifically a chat.&amp;nbsp;Still&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You&amp;#8217;ll think the content of the backstory is all that matters, but the tone also informs &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GPT&lt;/span&gt;. Because &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GPT&lt;/span&gt; probably created that backstory this doubles down on its tone. (Is this feedback part of its tedious&amp;nbsp;positivity?)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When you ask for &amp;#8220;more&amp;#8221; of a list it will feed the existing list into the prompt&amp;#8230; this helps it create new and distinct items, and sometimes helpfully refers to previous items (like creating interesting relations between people), but if you didn&amp;#8217;t like the suggestions before you are unlikely to like the new ones. It copies tone, but also description length, metadata, name ethnicities, and architectural&amp;nbsp;styles.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;GPT&lt;/span&gt; is&amp;nbsp;expensive&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://llm.ianbicking.org/citymaker/?name=builtin_talamora"&gt;Talamora&lt;/a&gt; cost me about $6 in &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GPT&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;API&lt;/span&gt; costs to generate. That&amp;#8217;s a&amp;nbsp;lot!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because I&amp;#8217;m paying for &lt;span class="caps"&gt;API&lt;/span&gt; costs directly, and because the costs increase only when I use the tool, there&amp;#8217;s a natural balance: if I&amp;#8217;m not having fun and enjoying the output, I won&amp;#8217;t generate more costs. By the time I made Talamora I had enough improvements that I actually enjoyed the process and my enthusiasm wasn&amp;#8217;t just built on dreams (which is the fuel for the first phase of any&amp;nbsp;project).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cost means I&amp;#8217;m not motivated to automate any of the authoring. Perhaps because the &lt;em&gt;output&lt;/em&gt; has little intrinsic value, so reducing the author&amp;#8217;s involvement is a net&amp;nbsp;loss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It also means I can&amp;#8217;t easily make this available to other people. People are providing these services with &amp;#8220;credit&amp;#8221; models and subscriptions but the underlying costs are enough that it&amp;#8217;s hard to imagine that working. So for now you can &lt;a href="https://llm.ianbicking.org/"&gt;try this&lt;/a&gt; with your own &lt;span class="caps"&gt;API&lt;/span&gt; key, paying OpenAI directly, and managing your own&amp;nbsp;budget.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are some ways that this could be made more&amp;nbsp;efficient:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use other models (e.g., &lt;code&gt;text-ada-001&lt;/code&gt;) for some tasks. Though few of the tasks feel amenable to the cheaper&amp;nbsp;models.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Get suggestions right the first time. For Talamora in particular I used lots of prompt adjustments to get results I was happy with. Overall prompt improvements would have avoided many of&amp;nbsp;those.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reduce context on some queries. The base context of most prompts includes the whole city backstory, neighborhood, etc. That&amp;#8217;s not necessary for every query. Perhaps some of the context is only needed for some types of&amp;nbsp;queries.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Get more out of every query. If there&amp;#8217;s multiple queries then the context is repeated for each. This saves money when some queries produce dead ends, such as a building that the author doesn&amp;#8217;t like and doesn&amp;#8217;t want to expand. But adding a little metadata to each item is usually a good&amp;nbsp;investment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Improve the quality. The more generated stuff you keep, the less queries you need to achieve some degree of success or satisfaction. Investing more time in quality parent context, like backstory and neighborhoods, will pay off with the both larger and more expensive leaf nodes like&amp;nbsp;buildings.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Summarize to reduce context. Right now this concatenate the context information. It might save some space by rephrasing that context, both combining the text in a more compact way, and selecting the salient details for generating specific kinds of&amp;nbsp;items.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Estimating list size for choices. If you get a list of 7 items but then you ask for the list to be extended that is &lt;em&gt;much&lt;/em&gt; more expensive than asking for 14 items up front. Similarly if you want 1 item then it&amp;#8217;s cheaper just to make one item and not a long list. It&amp;#8217;s possible that the parent could estimate the list size for the child, or that we could just make better general estimates and hardcode those list sizes into the&amp;nbsp;prompts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Image&amp;nbsp;generation&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All these words are interesting but some images would also be interesting. Right now there are too many considerations to do a detailed comparison of all of them, and things are changing fast, so I&amp;#8217;ll just give a scattering of&amp;nbsp;thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The&amp;nbsp;generators&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have a hard time understanding the array of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AI&lt;/span&gt; image generators, but I&amp;#8217;ve used these three enough to have&amp;nbsp;opinions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://replicate.com/stability-ai/stable-diffusion"&gt;Stable&amp;nbsp;Diffusion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://openai.com/dall-e-2/"&gt;Dall-E&amp;nbsp;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.midjourney.com/"&gt;Midjourney&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first two have an &lt;span class="caps"&gt;API&lt;/span&gt;. That means I can integrate them directly into the tool, which has a real and significant workflow benefit. Midjourney has absolute no affordances to integrate it into another application, but it creates great images. Generally I&amp;#8217;ve found Stable Diffusion to be unusable because it won&amp;#8217;t create sensible compositions. There&amp;#8217;s probably some flavor of Stable Diffusion that would work better, but there&amp;#8217;s just too much going on! Dall-E is &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OK&lt;/span&gt; but it doesn&amp;#8217;t have a natural sense of style and the resulting images&amp;#8230; just aren&amp;#8217;t very&amp;nbsp;fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Generating a&amp;nbsp;prompt&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The easy way is just to give the text directly to an image generator and let it imagine things as it will. There&amp;#8217;s a danger it will have insufficient context, like being unaware of the era or&amp;nbsp;environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#8217;s take a building to see. The base&amp;nbsp;text:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jubilous Forge:&lt;/strong&gt; A bustling forge bustling with laughter and the smell of hot metal forges and alchemical potions, with ornate decorations on its two-story&amp;nbsp;walls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s already a pretty visual&amp;nbsp;description.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#8217;s a quick prompt to expand the&amp;nbsp;visuals:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given the building: Jubilous Forge: A bustling forge bustling with laughter and the smell of hot metal forges and alchemical potions, with ornate decorations on its two-story&amp;nbsp;walls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2-3 sentences make a detailed visual description of the exterior of the&amp;nbsp;building:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Jubilous Forge looks&amp;nbsp;like&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it completes&amp;nbsp;with:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a large, imposing structure, with walls of gray stone reaching two stories high. The windows are framed by intricate patterns of wrought iron and the door is adorned with a bright, golden door knocker. The outdoor walls are decorated with vibrant murals of blacksmiths and alchemists at work, lit up by the warm glow of nearby forge&amp;nbsp;fires.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This seems better! Unfortunately it is not&amp;#8230; the use of the term &amp;#8220;pillar&amp;#8221; makes both Dall-E and Midjourney think of&amp;nbsp;banks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#8217;s a generated image from the simple/unmodified building&amp;nbsp;description:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://ianbicking.org/media/world-building-with-gpt/jubilant-midjourney-simple-1.png" alt="Midjourney - Isometric rendering of single building on a white background: Jubilous Forge: A bustling forge bustling with laughter and the smell of hot metal forges and alchemical potions, with ornate decorations on its two-story walls." class="content" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And here it is with the modified&amp;nbsp;description:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://ianbicking.org/media/world-building-with-gpt/jubilant-midjourney-prompted-1.png" alt="Midjourney - Isometric art of a single building on a white background: The Jubilous Forge looks like a large, imposing structure, with walls of gray stone reaching two stories high. The windows are framed by intricate patterns of wrought iron and the door is adorned with a bright, golden door knocker. The outdoor walls are decorated with vibrant murals of blacksmiths and alchemists at work, lit up by the warm glow of nearby forge fires." class="content" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first prompt, which leaves more latitude to Midjourney, works&amp;nbsp;better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh the other hand, in a jungle city there is a&amp;nbsp;building:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Zigzag Tower:&lt;/strong&gt; A tall and slender tower with a zigzag facade, The Zigzag Tower is a temple dedicated to the reverence of&amp;nbsp;nature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Midjourney results are all bland modern&amp;nbsp;towers:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://ianbicking.org/media/world-building-with-gpt/zigzag-midjourney-simple-1.png" alt="Midjourney - Isometric rendering of a single building on a white background: The Zigzag Tower: A tall and slender tower with a zigzag facade, The Zigzag Tower is a temple dedicated to the reverence of nature." class="content" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we include the city description and ask &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GPT&lt;/span&gt; to make a visual description we&amp;nbsp;get:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Zigzag Tower looks like a towering pillar of grandeur that sharply cuts into the sky, with its unique zigzag facade. Its yellow-brown hues blend with its natural surroundings, giving off a sense of harmony with the environment. It is adorned with intricate carvings and sculptures of animals and plants that make it seem to come alive in its own&amp;nbsp;right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The description doesn&amp;#8217;t look that different but the effect is&amp;nbsp;dramatic:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://ianbicking.org/media/world-building-with-gpt/zigzag-midjourney-prompted-1.png" alt="Midjourney - Isometric rendering of a single building on a white background: The Zigzag Tower looks like a towering pillar of grandeur that sharply cuts into the sky, with its unique zigzag facade. Its yellow-brown hues blend with its natural surroundings, giving off a sense of harmony with the environment. It is adorned with intricate carvings and sculptures of animals and plants that make it seem to come alive in its own right." class="content" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Describing the&amp;nbsp;style&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you ask for an image of a building that can mean all kinds of things. For instance this is what Stable Diffusion gives for the Jubilant&amp;nbsp;Forge:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://ianbicking.org/media/world-building-with-gpt/jubilant-sd-no-prefix.png" alt="jumbled old style drawing of a building" class="content" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interesting! But not the format I intended. Here&amp;#8217;s some additions to the prompt that&amp;nbsp;help:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;Isometric&amp;#8221; is a very strong word and will align the perspective and set the camera&amp;nbsp;angle.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Midjourney will happily make a stand-alone building. Dall-E often zooms too far in or gets confused, but it comes close. Stable Diffusion feels hopeless! I&amp;#8217;d be curious if Stable Diffusion and Dall-E could be asked to infill a template photo; i.e., create a isometric-shaped-building-size-hole so it has to work in those&amp;nbsp;constraints.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;White background&amp;#8221; suggests the building should be rendered without an environmental&amp;nbsp;context.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This prompt seems decent for both Midjourney and Dall-E: &lt;strong&gt;Isometric rendering of single building on a white&amp;nbsp;background&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of the lessons from this experiment could be applied to other top-down authoring&amp;nbsp;environments:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Establishing hierarchical&amp;nbsp;context.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GPT&lt;/span&gt; to offer suggestions at each level with author&amp;nbsp;selection.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using a combination of natural language and structured&amp;nbsp;output.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Include points of intervention to &amp;#8220;speak to&amp;#8221; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GPT&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be aware of all the language in a prompt; it all&amp;nbsp;matters.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use the tool a lot! The first couple things feel magical, but the magic will wear off after you&amp;#8217;ve made a couple dozen things without special&amp;nbsp;effort.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to try this yourself check out &lt;a href="https://llm.ianbicking.org/citymaker/"&gt;llm.ianbicking.org&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href="https://github.com/ianb/llm-garden"&gt;check out GitHub&lt;/a&gt;. If you are curious about the exact prompts look for &lt;code&gt;prompt =&lt;/code&gt; in &lt;a href="104537541227697934010/content_cache/d34/d33/637"&gt;citymakerdb.js&lt;/a&gt;. Note that this is a personal project, it&amp;#8217;s monolithic and only organized well enough for me to&amp;nbsp;understand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly: when using the site be warned I have not built it carefully for other people to use, stuff will be weird, errors will appear only in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;JS&lt;/span&gt; Console, there are no promises. And you&amp;#8217;ll have to bring your own &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GPT&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;API&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;key!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Large Language&amp;nbsp;Models&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve only been exploring …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Over two years ago I wrote &lt;a href="https://ianbicking.org/blog/2020/08/thoughts-on-voice-interfaces.html"&gt;Thoughts On Voice Interfaces&lt;/a&gt;, a scattering of ideas about voice interactions. Time has passed, I&amp;#8217;ve been working more on voice interfaces, and though products in the market have barely changed, I still have &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NEW&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;THOUGHTS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Large Language&amp;nbsp;Models&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve only been exploring large language models for a couple months, and limited to &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GPT&lt;/span&gt;-3, but most of this post will be about&amp;nbsp;LLMs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve included examples of prompts and outputs in this section. Click &lt;code&gt;⊕ Example&lt;/code&gt; to see the examples, all screenshots of the &lt;a href="https://beta.openai.com/playground"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;GPT&lt;/span&gt; Playground&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;With the addition of Large Language Models (LLMs), especially &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GPT&lt;/span&gt;-3, I believe everything will change. But not quickly, there&amp;#8217;s a huge amount of implementation and experimentation and finding and fixing&amp;nbsp;problems.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Existing systems are based on intent categorization and entity extraction:&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You have a bunch of commands, the commands take certain kinds of arguments (song title, time span, search query,&amp;nbsp;etc).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Any utterance is compared to examples and categorized as a command, and the arguments (&amp;#8220;entities&amp;#8221;) are&amp;nbsp;extracted.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This isn&amp;#8217;t just an implementation detail, but also forms the basic shape of voice interactions. Voice interactions work the way they do because this is the technology we have (until now). This command-based model is not begging for LLMs, though it could probably increase&amp;nbsp;accuracy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you plug voice into a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GPT&lt;/span&gt;-3-driven interaction you&amp;#8217;ll find it&amp;#8217;s very sensitive to speech recognition inaccuracies.&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the traditional categorization model it will naturally ignore many inaccuracies because it&amp;#8217;s just trying to find the best match among a finite set of commands and&amp;nbsp;examples.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;That is: the traditional model tries very hard to keep the conversation on the rails, and one inaccuracy won&amp;#8217;t make you jump to another&amp;nbsp;rail.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The beauty of an &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LLM&lt;/span&gt; is that we might not need rails, that we can make vastly more capable agents that can operate on a much wider set of&amp;nbsp;input.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The danger of LLMs is they take things very literally, and are very credulous. You want to know &lt;em&gt;what&amp;#8217;s next on my caliper&lt;/em&gt;? It will try very hard to come up with a creative answer instead of figuring out you were asking about your&amp;nbsp;calendar.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I&amp;#8217;m sure this isn&amp;#8217;t a fatal flaw, but it&amp;#8217;s a challenge right&amp;nbsp;now.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;LLMs are stereotyped as text &lt;em&gt;generators&lt;/em&gt;, but they are also great at &lt;em&gt;understanding&lt;/em&gt;. Two years ago I complained there&amp;#8217;s no &amp;#8220;understanding&amp;#8221; in &amp;#8220;natural language understanding&amp;#8221;. That will change.&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We still have to remind ourselves that what it&amp;#8217;s doing is not &amp;#8220;understanding&amp;#8221; as we know it; when an &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LLM&lt;/span&gt; responds to something there isn&amp;#8217;t an entity underneath that is understanding things.&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The understanding is when we fuse that a person&amp;#8217;s input with meaningful output or action. When we ground the model in some&amp;nbsp;purpose.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prompt_engineering"&gt;Prompt Engineering&lt;/a&gt; is an important part of that fusion: adding context to the input and interpreting the output. These shells we create are an embodiment of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AI&lt;/span&gt;, what turns a mechanism (an &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LLM&lt;/span&gt;) into a meaningful&amp;nbsp;entity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some understanding will be inference: being able to contextualize and make reasonable assumptions about what the a person means. This is what people pay a lot of attention to when talking about &amp;#8220;understanding,&amp;#8221; though I think it&amp;#8217;s over-emphasized. &lt;a href="/media/voice-2/math-inference.png" title="This is the most kind of &amp;quot;reasoning&amp;quot; referred to in GPT, being able to decompose and explain a formal multi-step problem."&gt;Example&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Much of understanding will be translation: taking our speech and translating it into an actionable form.&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We see this currently in &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GPT&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;s code generation. You can ask &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GPT&lt;/span&gt; for concrete answer but it&amp;#8217;s also very good at writing down the steps by which you can get an answer. &lt;a href="/media/voice-2/decomposing-steps.png" title="These queries are personalized, and can't be answered by GPT, but GPT can come up with a plan to answer the questions. That plan could also be reused or treated like a trigger, it's not a single concrete answer."&gt;Example&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;The steps by which you can get an answer&amp;#8221; is another way of saying &amp;#8220;a program&amp;#8221;. We will be programming our agents and getting our agents to generate programs. &lt;a href="/media/voice-2/decode-intent-to-instructions.png" title="Here we take examples of typical intents and have GPT translate them into a made-up programming language"&gt;Example&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You won&amp;#8217;t see the programs of course. Mostly. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GPT&lt;/span&gt; is also pretty good at turning code into natural language. I expect this round-tripping will be useful in debugging our agents, something we&amp;#8217;ll probably have to do individually from time to time. The same way we ask another person to repeat our instructions to make sure we&amp;#8217;re clear, we may ask our &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AI&lt;/span&gt; agents to do the same. &lt;a href="/media/voice-2/describe-instructions-as-intent.png" title="We take the output from the previous example and have GPT turn those programmatic instructions back into an English description. (Note there's no shared context between these examples, these descriptions are created only from the code.)"&gt;Example&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What&amp;#8217;s the programming language that our personal agents will be generating based on our commands? Probably something new, probably accidental, maybe the product of implicit negotiations between developers and the large language models, each of which is going to try to satisfy the&amp;nbsp;other.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LLM&lt;/span&gt; &amp;#8220;prompt&amp;#8221; is more than just a command for the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LLM&lt;/span&gt;. It&amp;#8217;s instruction and goal-setting and things we haven&amp;#8217;t yet discovered. But it&amp;#8217;s especially &lt;em&gt;context&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We haven&amp;#8217;t been providing this context to intent parser or to speech recognition itself. What context we&amp;#8217;ve been giving is mostly internal implementation details, not accessible to language understanding. That will have to&amp;nbsp;change.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Consider a case like sending a message to a contact: this often involves the difficult vocabulary of people&amp;#8217;s names. We may solve this generally by personalizing models so they work better with individualized information like your list of contacts. But with an &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LLM&lt;/span&gt; we can include that information in the prompt or context, much more casually and contextually than most personalization. &lt;a href="/media/voice-2/messaging-example.png" title="The beginning is context from a messaging app. Using this, as well as examples to show GPT how to format the response, it can interpret the destination for a message as well as separating those instructions from the body of the message."&gt;Example&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This represents an alternative to how we usually think about &amp;#8220;learning&amp;#8221; in voice interfaces, which is about frequency and probabilities. There&amp;#8217;s a lot of ideas about how to predict what the user will do and then bias the result based on that, or change the interface to make the likely thing easier, or even to do something proactively for the user. This is not&amp;nbsp;that!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Armed with many predictive capabilities I think we&amp;#8217;ve been projecting prediction onto human-to-human interactions where it doesn&amp;#8217;t exist. Your favorite barista does not actually make the coffee before you arrive. And even if they ask &amp;#8220;the regular?&amp;#8221; they are picking up the thread of past interactions and past conversations, not just predicting what you&amp;#8217;ll have. Prediction removes the autonomy and self-direction of the user. If there&amp;#8217;s a predictive analog in human-to-human interaction it&amp;#8217;s probably in how we stereotype each other and our respective roles, not in how we&amp;nbsp;communicate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;LLMs &lt;em&gt;love&lt;/em&gt; context. In your conversation you&amp;#8217;re building a transcript. It doesn&amp;#8217;t stop you from wandering, but it&amp;#8217;s always ready to build off that previous&amp;nbsp;context.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We&amp;#8217;ll have to figure out when to forget and when to erase context. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GPT&lt;/span&gt; has a fixation problem where it will sometimes persistently attend to an unimportant detail in a conversation. &lt;a href="/media/voice-2/question-fixation.png" title="Here you can see that GPT has decided to ask the same question over and over. While GPT is good at reacting to responses that don't follow the question, in cases like these it can &amp;quot;learn&amp;quot; from its own examples to do the wrong thing."&gt;Example&lt;/a&gt;. And as we support longer conversations and relationships that happen over days and months, we will have to think about how to keep the model&amp;#8217;s focus aligned with the user&amp;#8217;s mental model and&amp;nbsp;focus.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Follow-up and refining commands will be much easier with LLMs. Maybe everything will feel a little like a chatbot, though for functional and not personality reasons. People will become used to refinements that we&amp;#8217;ve been self-censoring because we don&amp;#8217;t believe they are possible. &lt;a href="/media/voice-2/followups.png" title="Here we see how GPT will interpret following follow-ups contextually, making easy use of implied references to those earlier statements."&gt;Example&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A mind-bending part of building a chat interface directly on &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GPT&lt;/span&gt;-3 is that you have to create archetypes and entities from scratch.&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is no &amp;#8220;you&amp;#8221; and &amp;#8220;me&amp;#8221;. &amp;#8220;You&amp;#8221; is a character that has to be introduced and described to the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LLM&lt;/span&gt;. Armed with a description the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LLM&lt;/span&gt; will then predict what this entity might do. The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LLM&lt;/span&gt; doesn&amp;#8217;t &amp;#8220;pretend&amp;#8221; to be &amp;#8220;you&amp;#8221; as there is no underlying personality. And &amp;#8220;me&amp;#8221; (the human) is again an introduced entity. Without constraints the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LLM&lt;/span&gt; will gladly predict &lt;em&gt;both&lt;/em&gt; sides of the conversation. &lt;a href="/media/voice-2/both-sides-conversation.png" title="Here GPT interprets what is intended to be a chat as something closer to a transcript, and predicts both sides of the conversation in the transcript proceed"&gt;Example&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maybe there&amp;#8217;s something cool that could be done by making it a conversation between me and me: that is, modeling the interaction on internal dialog. &lt;a href="/media/voice-2/two-self-personalities.png" title="This is more attempt than example, presenting two personas (the human and AI) as two aspects of the same person. GPT is somewhat stubborn about actually using words like &amp;quot;I&amp;quot; for both sides of the conversation to refer to the same person."&gt;Example 1&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="/media/voice-2/long-term-short-term.png" title="This example imagines an assistant that you talk to fairly continuously as an ongoing record of your day, thoughts, and tasks; while it also tries to ask you questions to make sure it gets all the details it will need for later."&gt;Example&amp;nbsp;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It&amp;#8217;s a fun party trick to make &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GPT&lt;/span&gt;-3 say things in the style of &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/tqbf/status/1598513757805858820"&gt;The Bible&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/goodside/status/1562991379915341824"&gt;Jar Jar Binks&lt;/a&gt;, but it&amp;#8217;s more than that&amp;#8230;&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Asking &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GPT&lt;/span&gt; to write something for a kindergartener is great. Maybe that should even be a standard starting instead of &amp;#8220;normal&amp;#8221; output. &lt;a href="/media/voice-2/kindergartener.png" title="In this example we took a fairly technical description of a model, pasted it in and asked it to be summarized for a kindergartener. It loses a lot of information, but keep a general gist. Results vary considerably based on the source of the information."&gt;Example&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Asking it to write for speech output could work, though I haven&amp;#8217;t had much success in my brief experiments. I don&amp;#8217;t know what to ask for, and I&amp;#8217;m not sure what &amp;#8220;good for speech output&amp;#8221; really means. Some people have had good success with &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ramsri_goutham/status/1612818789858697216"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;SSML&lt;/span&gt; generation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Adjustments to the output are very amenable to user override: changing the tone to be more brief, emphasize certain points, etc. These kinds of adjustments can be done without introducing combinatorial complexity. &lt;a href="/media/voice-2/summary-lengths.png" title="The source material for this example was a long day-by-day forecast. This shows several levels of detail and summary that can be created from that one source."&gt;Example&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Given the right chat context for an individual, and enough quantity, I&amp;#8217;m guessing an &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LLM&lt;/span&gt; may naturally adopt the user&amp;#8217;s phrasing and language style. Though I wonder if people naturally &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code-switching"&gt;code switch&lt;/a&gt; to speak in a &amp;#8220;formal&amp;#8221; style with voice interfaces. (&amp;#8220;Naturally&amp;#8221; may be learned behavior to avoid speech recognition errors, or it might also be based on the mental model we have about our relationship with the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AI&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;agent.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I&amp;#8217;m optimistic about the novel way you can compose text in ChatGPT, by acting more as an editor than an author, and how this will be applicable to voice&amp;#8230;&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If ChatGPT writes something for you and you want to change it, the best way is usually to ask for the change. &amp;#8220;Make it shorter,&amp;#8221; or &amp;#8220;take out the part about Jar Jar Binks.&amp;#8221; &lt;a href="/media/voice-2/edit-make-list.png" title="This uses the GPT Edit API which is constrained just to these kinds of editing commands. Here it's able to understand what part of the first sentence is a list and then turn that into a formatted list and two paragraphs"&gt;Example&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This is also a good way to edit with your voice. Referring to specific sentences or paragraphs or describing mechanical changes is very hard to do with voice. It&amp;#8217;s hard to compose those edits in your head, and it&amp;#8217;s hard to say them accurately. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GPT&lt;/span&gt; is quite good at editing text that is human generated. &lt;a href="/media/voice-2/edit-pronouns.png" title="When we ask to make a substitution with GPT it doesn't just make a string substitution, but also all the changes that keep the text grammatically correct."&gt;Example&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I think there are entirely new patterns of interaction possible with LLMs&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Instead of commanding, maybe you speak to your &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AI&lt;/span&gt; agent freely; the emphasis is just to dump a lot of stuff into it. Then you start using that accumulated information as the basis for action. &lt;a href="/media/voice-2/turn-voice-into-todo-list.png" title="Here we take a long and unstructured transcript, brainstorming tasks for the day, and use GPT to turn it into a structured to-do list"&gt;Example&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maybe it&amp;#8217;s less transactional, less modal. You could be asking it to do something and then instead of pausing and waiting for it to do the thing you could just&amp;#8230; keep going. The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AI&lt;/span&gt; starts to assemble a plan for complicated actions, while still immediately acting on things that are easy and low-impact, though also respecting any higher-level instructions like ordering or conditionals. &lt;a href="/media/voice-2/decompose-actions.png" title="This is a rough example of trying to take a number of actions and turn them into a plan. A more complete example would find dependencies between actions, determine actions are timed, and which actions require confirmation, and then producing a plan based on that. GPT doesn't have to compose the entire plan if it can categorize the actions so that a more formal algorithm can produce a complete plan."&gt;Example&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;GPT&lt;/span&gt; and probably all LLMs are fairly expensive, more expensive than any of the current techniques.&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hopefully this stuff gets cheaper, not because compute gets much cheaper but because smart people just figure things out. But there may be a hard lower bound on the&amp;nbsp;cost.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It&amp;#8217;s possible to select different models and approaches in different contexts, most of them more efficient; I expect very eclectic stacks to&amp;nbsp;emerge.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When we start getting Large Language Models built on &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ianbicking/status/1612944221199294464"&gt;predicting text &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AND&lt;/span&gt; behavior&lt;/a&gt; I think we&amp;#8217;ll see another burst of&amp;nbsp;capability.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;More Voice&amp;nbsp;Thoughts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So obviously I&amp;#8217;m personally pretty focused on the effect of LLMs, but there&amp;#8217;s more to be&amp;nbsp;said&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Endpointing remains a major issue. That is, deciding when the person is &amp;#8220;done&amp;#8221; speaking and then acting on that speech.&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The idea of &amp;#8220;done&amp;#8221; itself imposes very specific ideas on how an interaction&amp;nbsp;works.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This whole &amp;#8220;done&amp;#8221; thing is imposed. Every system that uses silence-based endpointing is also capable of listening a little longer, with no real privacy issue. It feels a bit like a &amp;#8220;lalala I&amp;#8217;m not listening to you&amp;#8221; situation, where it&amp;#8217;s better just to not know that the user is continuing to&amp;nbsp;speak.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;TTS&lt;/span&gt; output &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; make it difficult to leave the mic open. With the right physical device setup I assume it would be possible to quickly stop &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TTS&lt;/span&gt; when the original speaker continues to speak. Thoroughly designed and vertically integrated physical devices are not the norm, so this pattern doesn&amp;#8217;t become the norm.&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I feel a sense of both optimism and disappointment about a well integrated physical device; that is a device where the microphone, speaker, physical controls, other input modalities (like an &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inertial_measurement_unit"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;IMU&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;), speech recognition, speech understanding, command execution, and output systems are all integrated for a more ideal experience. The potential is there at every level but hardware like this requires capital and the total experience requires vision. Will we have to wait for a big player to discover the vision, or for the hardware design to become more accessible for a new entrant? (I wish &lt;a href="https://www.ray-ban.com/usa/ray-ban-stories"&gt;Rayban Stories&lt;/a&gt; were a more open&amp;nbsp;environment!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Humans have many forms of non-verbal or at least non-speech ways to indicate a desire to continue or interrupt. This is also a point of frequent errors, and requires reading other people in a way that many people find difficult. Still I think there&amp;#8217;s more room to mimic some of these patterns: the &amp;#8220;uh&amp;#8221; call to attention, the stare-at-the-sky please-wait gesture, the facial expression of pausing&amp;nbsp;mid-sentence.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Invocation remains a barrier to fluid voice interactions.&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wake words and other voice invocations like special hardware gestures are only accessible when you have control of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OS&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There aren&amp;#8217;t many tools to prototype wake words or keyword spotting. This also gets in the way of using &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procedure_word"&gt;procedure words&lt;/a&gt; to control things like mic state or make markers in your voice transcript to correspond to other events. I still like the idea of procedure words but I&amp;#8217;ve poor luck actually making them&amp;nbsp;work.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I&amp;#8217;m divided on purely wake-word-based initiation and hardware buttons or other ways to initiate. Using a wake word is more socially appropriate because it informs any bystanders what is happening. And if you are going to talk, why not start it by talking? But people – sometimes including myself – seem to like other controls. It also opens up some possibility for multitasking with voice. If you are in a call you don&amp;#8217;t want to use a wake word because the word will end up in the call&amp;#8230; it can mute once you complete, but you&amp;#8217;ve already said something&amp;nbsp;weird.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Speech recognition systems aren&amp;#8217;t just &amp;#8220;better&amp;#8221; and &amp;#8220;worse&amp;#8221;, individual systems have different behavior.&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Though it&amp;#8217;s seldom used, I like the idea of using spelling to handle difficult-to-recognize words. That is, you might say &amp;#8220;tee oh oh&amp;#8221; if you want to force the system to write &amp;#8220;too&amp;#8221; instead of &amp;#8220;to&amp;#8221;. But support for this is spotty and inconsistent. Systems don&amp;#8217;t frequently distinguish between explicit cases like this or spoken punctuation, and implied&amp;nbsp;text.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Punctuation is also handled differently, some systems mostly emit just words, others try to punctuate everything. And somehow even spoken punctuation (e.g., saying &amp;#8220;period&amp;#8221; for &amp;#8220;.&amp;#8221;) is applied inconsistently in a single&amp;nbsp;system.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/openai/whisper"&gt;Whisper&lt;/a&gt; is an impressive speech recognizer but it&amp;#8217;s not real time and not easy to apply to interactions.&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Right now speech recognition systems usually have &lt;em&gt;partial&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;final&lt;/em&gt; transcriptions. We&amp;#8217;ve all seen the partial recognition change as we continue to speak and earlier words are corrected given later context. These represent two levels of recognition. Whisper uses an even wider window of analysis to identify a sensible sentence given the input. Maybe we could have three levels: very fast partial transcriptions, ~1 second transcriptions, and then a ~4+ second &amp;#8220;this time it&amp;#8217;s really final&amp;#8221; transcript? But seeing the transcript update even further back may be confusing or distracting for the user, and it may be hard to trust that errors in the not-quite-final transcription will get fixed with a little patience. And the programming is already hard to get right with just two versions of the&amp;nbsp;transcript.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Whisper makes retraining seem more accessible. Are there alternatives to current microphones that get enough information to create a transcription, even if they don&amp;#8217;t get enough information to build an audio recording that other people could recognize? Like a microphone in earbuds, embedded in eyeglass temples, or something touching the nose bridge or neck&amp;#8230; and instead of using tricks to make those microphones sound &amp;#8220;normal,&amp;#8221; train directly on the raw data they&amp;nbsp;produce.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There&amp;#8217;s room for more voice consumption that doesn&amp;#8217;t have any output at all, or immediately do anything.&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;That isn&amp;#8217;t &lt;em&gt;just&lt;/em&gt; voice recorders. There are tools like Otter or Google Recorder that faithfully listen, but mostly just&amp;nbsp;transcribe.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve imagined a process for recording family photos and documents with voice and photos, so that your photos are directly connected with those&amp;nbsp;stories.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maybe a generalization: you can, without real time feedback, fuse voice with other input if you have a &lt;em&gt;record&lt;/em&gt; of that other input, so that you can fix mistakes later instead of relying on feedback to fix mistakes during the&amp;nbsp;interaction.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I&amp;#8217;m excited about the possibility for asymmetric I/O: speaking into the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AI&lt;/span&gt;, but presenting the results visually.&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This would solve some of the all-or-nothing issue with intent parsing. It&amp;#8217;s much easier to live update something visual so the computer can show its best-effort interpretation at any&amp;nbsp;time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Screens represent a conversation between the human and the computer. The computer is showing what is possible (buttons and fields), what it knows (informational elements), the status of different inputs (cursors, dialog boxes). The standard &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GUI&lt;/span&gt; conversation with a computer is more like whiteboarding than a conversation.&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Just doing voice control of our screens hasn&amp;#8217;t caught on. But these traditional &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GUI&lt;/span&gt; elements – buttons, etc – are specific to non-voice inputs. What would a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GUI&lt;/span&gt; designed voice input look like? I genuinely don&amp;#8217;t&amp;nbsp;know!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When phrased as an accessibility technology voice will be caught in this not-design-for-voice trap. &amp;#8220;Accessibility&amp;#8221; implies &amp;#8220;small group of people,&amp;#8221; and &amp;#8220;not your real audience,&amp;#8221; and &amp;#8220;applicable to status quo&amp;nbsp;software.&amp;#8221;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The Problem&amp;nbsp;Statement&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All great tools &lt;em&gt;solve a problem&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lists&amp;nbsp;end&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dictionaries don&amp;#8217;t have every&amp;nbsp;key&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I don&amp;#8217;t have enough&amp;nbsp;ideas&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;List operations usually happen right away and sometimes I&amp;#8217;d like them to take a second or two so I can appreciate the effort involved in&amp;nbsp;programming&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My types and values are consistent like a program, not expressive and eclectic like natural&amp;nbsp;language&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;But wait, there&amp;#8217;s&amp;nbsp;more!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;iaia&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;magic&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;magic&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;first_wikipedia_paragraph&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;Minneapolis&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)[:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;80&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;Missing&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;imports&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;wikipedia&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="n"&gt;To&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;install&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;gessing&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
     &lt;span class="n"&gt;pip&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;install&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;wikipedia&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;Do&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;it&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;now&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;?&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;y&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;N&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;y&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;installation&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;Minneapolis ( (listen)) is the largest city in Minnesota, United States, and the&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;magic&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;first_wikipedia_paragraph&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# see what it&amp;#39;s doing&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;first_wikipedia_paragraph&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;arg1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;str&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Who knew there was a &lt;code&gt;wikipedia&lt;/code&gt; package? (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;GPT&lt;/span&gt; knew, but I did&amp;nbsp;not.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#8217;s make it more like a chat, and circle in on our&amp;nbsp;answer&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;magic&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;primes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;7&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# We wanted the first 10 primes, not the primes up to 10, let&amp;#39;s try...&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Extending the problem&amp;nbsp;statement&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;So many functions haven&amp;#8217;t been&amp;nbsp;written&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maybe functions should be more of a&amp;#8230;&amp;nbsp;negotiation?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Function signatures tell a story but the computer hasn&amp;#8217;t been&amp;nbsp;listening&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All exceptions are bad and should be&amp;nbsp;eliminated&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Old security holes don&amp;#8217;t offer us enough excitement, we need to explore new frontiers of&amp;nbsp;vulnerabilities&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;But really, how does it&amp;nbsp;work?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To see what&amp;#8217;s happening just set &lt;code&gt;$IAIA_VERBOSE&lt;/code&gt; or run &lt;code&gt;iaia.set_verbose(True)&lt;/code&gt;. You&amp;#8217;ll see the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GPT&lt;/span&gt; queries printed out. For lists they look like&amp;nbsp;this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;books&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;InfiniteAIArray&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;([&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;Les Misérables&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;])&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;books&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;Request&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;temperature&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;0.5&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;A&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;list&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;of&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;items&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;created&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;with&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;the&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;code&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;books&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class="o"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# books`:&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="mf"&gt;1.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Les&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Misérables&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="mf"&gt;2.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;------------------------------------------------------------&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Response&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span class="n"&gt;The&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Catcher&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;the&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Rye&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;Stop&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;reason&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;stop&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;Response&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;time&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mf"&gt;1.23&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;s&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;Tokens&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;used&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;30&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class="n"&gt;total&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;36&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;cached&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;36&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;0.0007&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;w&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;o&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;cache&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;0.0007&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;The Catcher in the Rye&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;In my experience &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GPT&lt;/span&gt; thinks very highly of &lt;em&gt;Catcher in the Rye&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dictionaries are&amp;nbsp;similar:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;authors&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;InfiniteAIDict&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;authors&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;Les Misérables&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;Request&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;temperature&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;0.5&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;A&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;list&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;of&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;value&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;pairs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;created&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;with&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;the&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;code&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;authors&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class="o"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# authors`:&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Functions are based on the&amp;nbsp;signature:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span class="err"&gt;```&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;arctan&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;arg1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;float&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;------------------------------------------------------------&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Response&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="sd"&gt;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="sd"&gt;    Calculates the arctangent of a given number.&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="sd"&gt;    Parameters:&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="sd"&gt;    arg1 (float): The number to calculate the arctangent of.&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="o"&gt;============================================================&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#8217;ll notice in this case it uses the &lt;code&gt;math&lt;/code&gt; module but doesn&amp;#8217;t import it. This causes an exception which is caught and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GPT&lt;/span&gt; is asked to fix&amp;nbsp;it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;The&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;following&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;throws&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;an&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;exception&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;NameError&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;math&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;is&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;not&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;defined&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It tries one time to fix an exception, though if you keep calling the function using the same signature it will try each time to get rid of the exceptions and may incrementally succeed. Though with this prompt it tends to cover up errors as often as fix&amp;nbsp;them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#8217;ve gotten this far I will also throw in here that I (&lt;a href="https://ianbicking.org"&gt;Ian&lt;/a&gt;) am looking for a job, and maybe the best job for me is one that I don&amp;#8217;t yet know exists. I&amp;#8217;m particularly interested in the area of large language models (not just as a joke), new user interactions built on LLMs (especially their abilities to understand us in new ways). I&amp;#8217;m excited about education, aiding in executive function, and human-centered interactions. &lt;a href="mailto:ianbicking@gmail.com"&gt;Let me know if you have ideas&lt;/a&gt;, I would appreciate&amp;nbsp;it!&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="ai"></category></entry><entry><title>Firefox Was Always Enough</title><link href="https://ianbicking.org/blog/2020/11/firefox-was-always-enough.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-11-18T00:00:00-06:00</published><updated>2020-11-18T00:00:00-06:00</updated><author><name>Ian Bicking</name></author><id>tag:ianbicking.org,2020-11-18:/blog/2020/11/firefox-was-always-enough.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;There are many concerns about Mozilla right now, and reason to be concerned.

While I am no longer with Mozilla, it’s still a place that supported me for many years; I believe in Mozilla and want the project to&amp;nbsp;succeed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Mozilla&amp;#8217;s one&amp;nbsp;product&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s not always clear from the outside, but Mozilla has always made the bulk of its money from selling the preferred placement of a search engine in Firefox. That’s been Google in the U.S., except for a brief stint with&amp;nbsp;Yahoo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Firefox was forked from the now-defunct Mozilla Suite in 2002, an experimental project by Blake Ross, Joe Hewitt, and David Hyatt. By 2003 all three had left for other&amp;nbsp;companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Firefox went on to great success, peaking at &lt;a href="https://gs.statcounter.com/browser-market-share#monthly-200901-202010"&gt;30% of browser marketshare&lt;/a&gt; and hundreds of millions of users. Firefox is Mozilla&amp;#8217;s one product, greatest success, and the reason Mozilla still&amp;nbsp;exists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;The pursuit of revenue&amp;nbsp;diversity&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout the entire ten years I was at Mozilla, we were always concerned about “revenue&amp;nbsp;diversity”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s uncomfortable to get most of your income from your competitor. For many years Google added insult by advertising Chrome on those very search&amp;nbsp;pages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But to be clear: the money always kept coming! On a per-user basis it even increased over the years. There was never a collapse of search-deal&amp;nbsp;revenue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Mozilla is going through some problems: there was a major layoff in January 2020, and I myself was part of 25% of the workforce laid off in August 2020. The latter was blamed on a Covid downturn, but I believe Covid only accelerated layoffs that were otherwise&amp;nbsp;inevitable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the money is still coming in! Mozilla is still getting more money than it did when its marketshare had peaked. It’s still getting enough money to pay for a large&amp;nbsp;staff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The answer is clear to me: if Mozilla wants to improve its financial position, then it needs to increase the number of Firefox users. That’s always been the right focus, and it’s still the right&amp;nbsp;focus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Founders and&amp;nbsp;vision&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I remember when &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brendan_Eich"&gt;Brendan Eich&lt;/a&gt; was &lt;a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2014/04/03/brendan-eich-steps-down-as-mozilla-ceo/"&gt;briefly the Mozilla &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CEO&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. It was noted that a founder has a special place and ability as a leader. We never got to find out, but there was some sense to it: a founder has particular authority, without getting that authority through consensus-building. If you bring in a decisive outsider they will probably fail, lacking the authority (and probably the wisdom) to guide the company. If you bring in or promote someone appropriate for a more mature company, then the company may be operated well but the choices made will be more&amp;nbsp;conservative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem? &lt;em&gt;Firefox’s&lt;/em&gt; founders are all long, long gone. Brendan and &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitchell_Baker"&gt;Mitchell&lt;/a&gt; are &lt;em&gt;Mozilla&amp;#8217;s&lt;/em&gt; founders. This isn’t to say that the people that founded Firefox had entirely unique perceptions or abilities, but a founder has a unique ability to &lt;em&gt;advocate&lt;/em&gt; for a vision. To be&amp;nbsp;heard&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Firefox vs.&amp;nbsp;Platform&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I joined Mozilla there were two large&amp;nbsp;groups:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;Firefox Group&lt;/strong&gt; would be the ones responsible for things like tabs, bookmarks, history, the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;URL&lt;/span&gt; bar, your profiles, cookie management, data sync and backup, etc. (Ironically these parts were called “chrome” before Chrome even&amp;nbsp;existed.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Platform&lt;/strong&gt; built &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gecko_(software)"&gt;Gecko&lt;/a&gt;, made the renderer, implemented new Web APIs, handled networking. Firefox was always the only meaningful consumer of this platform, but Platform didn’t think of itself as simply serving Firefox’s&amp;nbsp;needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Platform was the dominant group, the ones who called the shots, while the Firefox frontend developers were just trying to keep&amp;nbsp;up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later the two groups would be combined into the singular Firefox group, which I think was an important organizational improvement. But the underlying tensions of these two perspectives still&amp;nbsp;persisted&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;What is Firefox&amp;nbsp;for?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At some point I took to asking people in Mozilla: what is the purpose of Firefox? This was during Firefox 3 days when optimism for the product was&amp;nbsp;low.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I expected a few answers, like to give the users of Firefox a great experience, or to give us a delivery vehicle for our principles of autonomy and privacy, or to keep the web relevant and vibrant in people’s&amp;nbsp;lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I did get all those answers, but also one I didn&amp;#8217;t expect: Firefox exists just to give Mozilla a seat at the table when the web is&amp;nbsp;defined.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To explain: the web, and much of the internet, is based on standards, maintained by places like &lt;a href="https://www.w3.org/"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;W3C&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://whatwg.org/"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;WHATWG&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.ecma-international.org/"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;ECMA&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href="https://www.ietf.org/"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;IETF&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. These standards can help protect users, maintain privacy, expand the web platform, make technology more widely accessible, give people autonomy, anonymity, security. Or a standard can work against all those&amp;nbsp;principles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The standards don’t just apply to Firefox users. They affect all browsers and many devices that aren’t even browsers. So if Mozilla can positively affect these standards it can benefit&amp;nbsp;everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One good way to get a seat at the table is to be an important implementor. Standards are sometimes created with no implementations, but these usually don’t go anywhere. With that lesson learned, browser implementors have a lot of weight, both about how things are standardized and where attention is&amp;nbsp;directed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With this in mind the argument is: Firefox has to be popular enough that Mozilla has at least a veto over problematic points of standards, and the ability to vigorously advance positive&amp;nbsp;standards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a real thing at Mozilla. It still is to this day, even if exact kind of influence Mozilla is trying to apply has&amp;nbsp;changed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is terrible for&amp;nbsp;Firefox.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Firefox was never&amp;nbsp;enough&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mozilla was never going to be happy building a great browser that its users loved. And don’t we all try to do the thing that makes us happy? If you don’t think a great browser will make you happy,&amp;nbsp;then&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And what is a better browser? Remember what was really cool in Firefox? Tabs! That was so long ago&amp;#8230; but why were tabs great? What are they for? I wish I could tell you that Mozilla was filled with competing pet theories and solutions based on those theories. It was not. (But it’s not too&amp;nbsp;late.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I see four visions for advancement of&amp;nbsp;browsers:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Quantitative improvement:&lt;/strong&gt; The browser is window onto websites, and we should make it the best window it can be. Faster, lighter. Everything it is now, but more. (See &lt;a href="https://servo.org/"&gt;Servo&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;All encompassing:&lt;/strong&gt; The web hosts most of our desktop applications. It should host even more of them, it should host mobile applications, it should be the universal platform. More APIs. More ways to package and present sites. (See &lt;a href="https://www.chromium.org/teams/web-capabilities-fugu"&gt;Project Fugu&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Technological pessimism:&lt;/strong&gt; The internet is terrible and we should make it less terrible. We need better privacy. Better security. More process isolation, more sandboxing. Less APIs and more restrictions on those APIs. (See &lt;a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/unfck/"&gt;Unfck the Internet&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://brave.com/"&gt;Brave&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A better browser:&lt;/strong&gt; The browser is used to… browse. To manage tasks, multitask, remember history, manage navigation, get us back to where we want to go. It’s an information tool. Browser should have better tab and task management, easier recall, tools to capture and move information. (See new browsers like &lt;a href="https://vivaldi.com/"&gt;Vivaldi&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://tryshift.com/"&gt;Shift&lt;/a&gt;, and up and coming things like [&lt;a href="https://www.getamna.com/"&gt;Amna&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://thebrowser.company/"&gt;The Browser Company&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chrome started out very focused on &lt;em&gt;quantitative improvement&lt;/em&gt; but seems to be expanding towards &lt;em&gt;all encompassing&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I started at Mozilla it was focused on &lt;em&gt;all encompassing&lt;/em&gt; (culminating in &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firefox_OS"&gt;Firefox &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). But Firefox was frankly underwater quantitatively, and &lt;a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2017/11/14/introducing-firefox-quantum/"&gt;Quantum&lt;/a&gt; represented a bit of a pivot to &lt;em&gt;quantitative improvement&lt;/em&gt;. Now it&amp;#8217;s focused on &lt;em&gt;technological pessimism&lt;/em&gt; in the form of a security and privacy&amp;nbsp;emphasis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t have a read on Edge, and as far as I can tell Safari isn’t into anything. Small upstarts seem interested in filling the &lt;em&gt;better browsing&lt;/em&gt; vacuum, and I wish them luck, but it&amp;#8217;s a hard&amp;nbsp;market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An organization with a love of the web and an understanding of the technology underneath the web could do something great. If only Firefox could be enough for&amp;nbsp;Mozilla.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="misc"></category></entry><entry><title>Project ideas for (what’s left of) 2020</title><link href="https://ianbicking.org/blog/2020/09/project-ideas-2020.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-09-15T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2020-09-15T00:00:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Ian Bicking</name></author><id>tag:ianbicking.org,2020-09-15:/blog/2020/09/project-ideas-2020.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;script type="application/json" class="js-hypothesis-config"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I&amp;#8217;m conflicted with the need to find a new job, versus using this break from employment to do things I don&amp;#8217;t otherwise do, one way or another I feel compelled to &lt;em&gt;make something&lt;/em&gt;.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cons:&lt;/strong&gt; I usually have a job, and this is a unique moment when I don’t have a&amp;nbsp;job&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span id="figure-out-what-job"&gt;Figure out what job I&amp;nbsp;want&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m unemployed, I should probably figure out what I want to&amp;nbsp;do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have a sense of what I want to do, an intersection of a Kind Of Work, and Topics Of&amp;nbsp;Interest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Kind Of Work I want to do probably goes under the title of Product Engineer or Research Engineer, but those titles aren’t used universally or particularly well understood. I want to make new things, engaged individually and as part of a team in the ongoing discovery of the product scope. I’d like to be part of a small, diverse, multidisciplinary&amp;nbsp;team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Topics Of Interest would&amp;nbsp;include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;New user interfaces (including&amp;nbsp;voice)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Edtech with a focus on pedagogy (I’m not as interested in tools supporting bureaucracy of&amp;nbsp;education)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Efforts directed at &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_functions"&gt;executive&amp;nbsp;function&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Productivity tools, using the lens of executive function (how can our tools support the executive function of&amp;nbsp;users)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Psychological&amp;nbsp;well-being&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I have a technical interest in user-empowering automation&amp;nbsp;tools&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I have some &lt;a href="https://www.ianbicking.org/blog/2020/09/a-history-of-projects.html#togetherjs"&gt;interest in collaboration&amp;nbsp;tools&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I do enjoy making development tools, but I’m not sure it’s where I want to go with my&amp;nbsp;career&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My tasks here are (a) working better at describing my goals, and (b) verifying the goals. What do I really want to do, and what do I want to want to&amp;nbsp;do?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pros:&lt;/strong&gt; Sets me up to find the right job for&amp;nbsp;me&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cons:&lt;/strong&gt; Encourages me to focus on something that might not&amp;nbsp;exist&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span id="web-projects"&gt;Web&amp;nbsp;projects&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span id="document-store"&gt;Web-based document&amp;nbsp;store&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a way for applications and personal documents to&amp;nbsp;interact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This thinking came out of the blog post &lt;a href="http://www.ianbicking.org/blog/2019/01/we-need-open-hosting-platforms.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;We Need Open Hosting Platforms&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea for the system is really just documents. These could be notes, essays, images, slideshows, or anything that the user authors. It’s not like a filesystem that also contains all kinds of system files and programs that don’t belong and aren’t managed by the user. It &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; like Google Drive or Dropbox or whatever, but&amp;#8230;&amp;nbsp;open?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s also not just named blobs. There’s lots of options for data storage, but it’s just a bunch of bytes and a content-type. Here we want to include other&amp;nbsp;information:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How can the document be&amp;nbsp;edited?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How can the document be&amp;nbsp;validated?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Core metadata (e.g.,&amp;nbsp;title)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Extensible metadata (e.g., images have&amp;nbsp;sizes)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How can the document be viewed in&amp;nbsp;public?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How can it be embedded in a web&amp;nbsp;page?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What permissions do other people have? What permissions are&amp;nbsp;possible?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Versioning&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Difference&amp;nbsp;display&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Copying and&amp;nbsp;linking&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Commenting&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Collaborative&amp;nbsp;editing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea here is that there is a framework for creating new kinds of documents, with both general &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UI&lt;/span&gt; (applicable to any document) and specific &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UI&lt;/span&gt; for different document&amp;nbsp;types.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Things like “editors” are static bundles of JavaScript and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HTML&lt;/span&gt; that obey certain protocols. Once you’ve got a document you might upgrade the editor, but you’ll also have a static copy of the editor in&amp;nbsp;perpetuity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A goal here is to allow open source developers to create new and interesting interfaces and interactions, without any of the worries of hosting. And users can use them without any worries about being bound to a service, and without placing any burden on the open source developer to maintain any kind of&amp;nbsp;service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pros:&lt;/strong&gt; I think the F/&lt;span class="caps"&gt;OSS&lt;/span&gt; community lacks innovation in the area of user experience, and the lack of a &lt;em&gt;place&lt;/em&gt; to do that work is part of it. Thinking critically about documents in the abstract is interesting to&amp;nbsp;me&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cons:&lt;/strong&gt; It’s pretty ambitious and I probably don’t have the endurance to make this work really happen. It’s only as good as other people might make&amp;nbsp;it&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span id="automated-exploration"&gt;Directed and automated exploratory testing of web&amp;nbsp;applications&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think this would be a great business, and the while the automated testing environment grows year-by-year and new ideas emerge, I still think there’s huge unmet&amp;nbsp;potential.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The web platform is pretty well-defined and sandboxed. At any moment a web application page supports dozens, but not thousands, of reasonable “next operations”: a click, keyboard entry, pasting, dragging, so forth. The protocols that support web debugging also expose much of the metadata you need (the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DOM&lt;/span&gt; itself does not). So I believe automated exploration of a web is feasible and&amp;nbsp;useful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I &lt;em&gt;hate&lt;/em&gt; scripted testing, such as Selenium. Most breakage of Selenium tests are because of tooling reasons, and of the remainder most are because of the test detecting intentional and correct changes. This testing punishes positive change instead of enabling&amp;nbsp;change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most conservative attempt to fix this test breakage problem is “resilient selectors”, that deal with fragile selectors. This is about the most modest fix I can&amp;nbsp;imagine!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A testing system built close to the web rendering system itself could fix many of the tooling issues, and many of the timing issues. &lt;a href="https://developers.google.com/web/tools/puppeteer"&gt;Puppeteer&lt;/a&gt; is an improvement&amp;#8230; but it’s a change to the paradigm that I think would really help: instead of testing against a script, the automation framework should just try things with an emphasis on reporting the result instead of comparing the function against a separately-maintained ideal (in the form of a scripted&amp;nbsp;test).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve put a lot of thought into this at Mozilla, though my pitches fell on deaf ears. I’m as optimistic about the idea now as I was many years ago when I started experimenting. But this is a Hard Work idea, not a Have Fun idea. I’m not opposed to hard work, but I’m not going to do it just for the fun, because it isn’t that&amp;nbsp;fun!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pros:&lt;/strong&gt; I’m personally convinced of the potential, &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; there are big interesting unanswered&amp;nbsp;questions&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cons:&lt;/strong&gt; It’s too big. It’s a developer tool, which is fine, but that&amp;#8217;s probably not what I want to do&amp;nbsp;long-term&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span id="simple-cms"&gt;Simple, reflective &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CMS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CMS&lt;/span&gt; be self-hosting? If you just do it as a file editor with the right sort of authentication, I suppose so. But can a &lt;em&gt;quality&lt;/em&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CMS&lt;/span&gt; be self-hosting? One that doesn’t invite you to corrupt the app itself, that can be updated, that is extensible without going deep into the code, that handles both the individual bits of content and the aggregate content and the change of content over&amp;nbsp;time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CMS&lt;/span&gt; wouldn’t actually be fully self-hosting, I imagine a an underlying storage and rendering layer that is fixed, but not &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UI&lt;/span&gt;-specific. And it requires some things like a rescue &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UI&lt;/span&gt; that can’t itself be&amp;nbsp;destroyed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’d want to prioritize a small codebase. Just making a featureful &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CMS&lt;/span&gt; isn’t a useful exercise for&amp;nbsp;me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pros:&lt;/strong&gt; I’ve been &lt;a href="https://www.ianbicking.org/blog/2020/09/a-history-of-projects.html#landscaper"&gt;thinking about this sort of thing a long&amp;nbsp;time&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cons:&lt;/strong&gt; I won’t do anything with the result, and the world is full enough of CMSs that no one else will&amp;nbsp;either&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span id="personal-automation"&gt;Personal web&amp;nbsp;automation&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the &lt;a href="https://www.ianbicking.org/blog/2019/03/firefox-experiments-i-would-have-liked.html"&gt;web ideas I’ve had at Mozilla&lt;/a&gt; now leave me feeling bored. I’m not trying to be a professional right&amp;nbsp;now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But web and browser automation is still stuck in my head. Right now can I make something useful for &lt;em&gt;just me&lt;/em&gt;? What processes should I be optimizing? What interactions need different controls? How would I want to access those&amp;nbsp;controls?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I might start by simply coding up the extension, and extending it in-place instead of creating any user-programmable&amp;nbsp;tool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pros:&lt;/strong&gt; Could be personally useful. Thinking this stuff through is interesting to me, and now is a good time for&amp;nbsp;self-experimentation&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cons:&lt;/strong&gt; It’s just diddling around with the same stuff I’ve been doing for a long&amp;nbsp;time&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;span id="contribute-to-clipper"&gt;Contribute to a web&amp;nbsp;clipper&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I came upon &lt;a href="https://github.com/jhlyeung/rumin-web-clipper"&gt;Rumin Web Clipper&lt;/a&gt; recently (though I haven’t reviewed the current state of the art). It’s the sort of thing I’ve worked on before, and I have a lot of ideas in this area, but I don’t want to be in charge of&amp;nbsp;anything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I could find a site or two to try to scrape from and submit some PRs. Then the next step is to take some of that data and put it &lt;em&gt;into&lt;/em&gt; a site: the other half of structured data&amp;nbsp;extraction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data extraction and injection is an interesting lens on&amp;nbsp;automation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pros:&lt;/strong&gt; My contributions could be useful even if I don’t stick with it. I can focus more on what I care about and less on&amp;nbsp;infrastructure&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cons:&lt;/strong&gt; I might be trying to colonize someone else’s&amp;nbsp;project&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span id="remaking-hotdish"&gt;Remake Hotdish. Also make&amp;nbsp;bots&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One idea I didn’t get to with &lt;a href="https://www.ianbicking.org/blog/2020/09/a-history-of-projects.html#togetherjs"&gt;TogetherJS&lt;/a&gt; was &lt;a href="https://www.ianbicking.org/blog/2014/02/collaboration-as-a-skeuomorphism-for-agents.html"&gt;Collaboration as a Skeuomorphism for Agents&lt;/a&gt;: using collaboration the mechanism for smart bots to act on your&amp;nbsp;behalf.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also all of &lt;a href="https://www.ianbicking.org/projects.html#hotdish"&gt;Hotdish&lt;/a&gt; felt like something not-quite-complete. Unfinished work hangs around in my&amp;nbsp;head.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Could I remake Hotdish in a simple way, with an eye to external&amp;nbsp;bots?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using a Firebase backend would make deployment fairly&amp;nbsp;light.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pros:&lt;/strong&gt; Gets some old ideas out of my head and into code. I feel better at a lot of the technologies than I was before. I’m really interested in the bot&amp;nbsp;angle&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cons:&lt;/strong&gt; Maintaining and using an extension is kind of a pain. I’d need people to actually use it with me. I can always recruit my wife, but will that be sufficient? And Chrome doesn’t have sidebars, which means the primary &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UI&lt;/span&gt; element I imagine wouldn’t be portable. I’m pretty sure the work would disappear into&amp;nbsp;obscurity&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span id="hypercard"&gt;Hypercard-like&amp;nbsp;thing&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This idea is perennial for many people. I don’t think we all agree what it&amp;nbsp;means.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To me this is a composition tool that can create simple, content-oriented interactive sites, with some simple core metaphors like buttons/links and&amp;nbsp;cards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The use of slideshow tools in schools make me more confident that this remains an important use case. I really hate that slide decks have become a significant medium in schools, but the positive side is that they are a good medium for short-form multimedia documents. The slide is a valid unit of structure, akin to the paragraph. The composition tools are flexible and don’t privilege text over everything else. It&amp;#8217;s almost an accident that the purported purpose is giving a&amp;nbsp;presentation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I see aspects of this embedded in newer online educational tools like Flipgrid and Seesaw. They raise the bar, but maybe also prove the&amp;nbsp;point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pros:&lt;/strong&gt; Feels of-the-moment. Some of the technology feels familiar. Other parts feel familiar but tedious (I’m not going to write a good drawing tool). Jumping onto someone else’s project might be possible (but&amp;nbsp;whose?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cons:&lt;/strong&gt; Large scope. Everyone projects different ideas onto Hypercard. Cannot be&amp;nbsp;finished&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span id="kids"&gt;For the&amp;nbsp;kids&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span id="wikipedia"&gt;Child-focused Wikipedia&amp;nbsp;browser&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently my father asked me what ever happened to &lt;a href="http://one.laptop.org/"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;OLPC&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. I looked it up to be sure – the domain is there! – but mostly the idea has passed. I found &lt;a href="https://medium.com/@mapmeld/if-one-laptop-per-child-started-today-80d105fef1bb"&gt;this retrospective about &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OLPC&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; from 2016 and it got me&amp;nbsp;thinking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Was &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OLPC&lt;/span&gt; too focused on &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructivism_(philosophy_of_education)"&gt;constructivism&lt;/a&gt;? That is, the idea of students actively constructing their education. I like constructivism, but now I’m skeptical if it’s actually &lt;em&gt;correct&lt;/em&gt;. Also: is it the right role for a computer in these&amp;nbsp;environments?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A computer can also be a font of wisdom, a deliverer of information. Maybe that’s enough. And of course Wikipedia is a nexus for&amp;nbsp;information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we just plopped Wikipedia on a kids computer, how well would that work? Certainly it doesn’t work if you are pre-literate, but that’s only one of many&amp;nbsp;problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What would it look like to make something that a kid could sit in front of, as their first ever computing experience, and experience Wikipedia? Probably there would be a place for speech output, maybe speech input. Nonlinear presentation of articles might be good. Using &lt;a href="https://simple.wikipedia.org/"&gt;simple.wikipedia.org&lt;/a&gt; might be useful (though I assume it’s only in English). Returning to and repeating content will be important for&amp;nbsp;kids.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It feels like it would be easy to get started on this, while the final product would be a long&amp;nbsp;journey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This could turn into a different browsing experience than the traditional web browser. But it is truly browsing, Wikipedia exemplifies the Old Web: linked documents containing information. But the content is more normalized and consistent (including editorially consistent) than the web, making it easier to&amp;nbsp;reimagine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WikiReader"&gt;WikiReader&lt;/a&gt; is an example, though not an &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1lRI35gKSPA&amp;amp;t=2s"&gt;example of much&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pros:&lt;/strong&gt; Interesting to think about. Getting started is easy. I live with some experiment subjects. I think Wikipedia is one of the best things we got&amp;nbsp;going&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cons:&lt;/strong&gt; I feel a little under equipped. It doesn’t satisfy my desire to do some technical deep&amp;nbsp;dives&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span id="microworlds"&gt;A foundation for a series of microworld&amp;nbsp;environments&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mindstorms introduced the idea of &lt;a href="http://edutechwiki.unige.ch/en/Microworld"&gt;Microworlds&lt;/a&gt;, but it never went anywhere. Where could it go? Is there an environment that could support many microwords? Would it look like Scratch, Logo, or something different? Or a framework for building&amp;nbsp;environments?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It might be unreasonable to even consider a foundation without first having several actual microworlds. But supporting small domains and ideas is part of the goal, so this isn’t a blocker. For&amp;nbsp;instance:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Buzzfeed-style quiz&amp;nbsp;generator&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Eliza-style&amp;nbsp;chatbot&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Word explorer (e.g., what words are palindromes? What words have 6 letters where the third is&amp;nbsp;T?)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Simple music&amp;nbsp;generation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cypher&amp;nbsp;building&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Math worksheet&amp;nbsp;creator&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s possible that it would be better to design these and not worry so much about the implementation. As long as I’m not implementing maybe there can be more ambitious&amp;nbsp;examples:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Projectile&amp;nbsp;physics&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ecology&amp;nbsp;simulation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Map generation,&amp;nbsp;erosion&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Equation exploration (explore things like how numbers increase by&amp;nbsp;square/cube/exponent)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Writing&amp;nbsp;cues&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Choose your own&amp;nbsp;adventure&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Foreign language exploration (what happens when you translate words vs&amp;nbsp;sentences?)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pros:&lt;/strong&gt; I think we’ve leaned in too far to “learn programming” but not nearly enough into “learn with&amp;nbsp;programming”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cons:&lt;/strong&gt; I haven’t taught these things myself, I just noodle around with the kids. I don’t feel pedagogically&amp;nbsp;competent&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span id="jslogo"&gt;Jslogo environment / &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IDE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.calormen.com/jslogo/"&gt;This Logo interpreter&lt;/a&gt; is a decent generic logo interpreter. (I &lt;a href="https://github.com/inexorabletash/jslogo/pull/70"&gt;learned Promises&lt;/a&gt; while contributing async support.) But when I use it with my kids it’s kind of awkward, and we always lose our&amp;nbsp;place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It would be nice to make use of the interpreter in a different&amp;nbsp;environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, I’m thinking less interactive/&lt;span class="caps"&gt;REPL&lt;/span&gt; and more about creating a full program. Right now the typical program we write is&amp;nbsp;like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;cs&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="err"&gt;repeat 4 [forward 100 rt 90]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;That is, always start with &lt;code&gt;cs&lt;/code&gt; (clear screen) and then a bunch of commands so it can be re-run from the beginning after&amp;nbsp;adjustments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I imagine making these repeatable code blocks the standard interaction pattern, treating them something like unnamed functions. Then if you want you can name them and compose them as well (&lt;em&gt;without&lt;/em&gt; the clear screen of&amp;nbsp;course).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It might be worth &lt;a href="https://escholarship.org/uc/item/1623m1p3"&gt;revisiting the history&lt;/a&gt; to look for other ideas (or &lt;a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23052300"&gt;mine some comments&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pros:&lt;/strong&gt; I know the language and am familiar with the implementation. Block programming has its advantages, but Logo also has affordances for children. The environment is a really big deal and I have an intuition on some improvements, but there’s also lots of active questions. Deploying is fairly easy, so it could exist in the wild even if I don’t pursue it&amp;nbsp;indefinitely&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cons:&lt;/strong&gt; Logo is a fairly obscure language. I’ve been impressed with how well the kids do with block programming. Turtles are &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OK&lt;/span&gt;, but also a little&amp;nbsp;eh&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span id="lo-fi-page-creator"&gt;Lo-fi text web page&amp;nbsp;creator&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is something my younger daughter vaguely requested, and makes sense to&amp;nbsp;me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imagine an 80s computer or roguelike, where the screen is your canvas and characters are your paint. So only absolute positioning on a strict grid. Emoji are the only graphics. Letters can be sized 1x, 2x, 3x,&amp;nbsp;etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m not sure if this requires a monospace font, and I’m not sure what the exact spacing of the font would be in that case; does a clean letter aspect ration matter (e.g.,&amp;nbsp;2x1)?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think there would still be click events and that sort of thing, so you could add dynamicism to the page (that’s the fun part). I tried creating a literal grid and was unhappy with it, so it would still be absolute positioned divs, just with fixed&amp;nbsp;alignment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This would require some emoji picker, like &lt;a href="https://github.com/elsmr/emoji-pane"&gt;emoji-pane&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://github.com/OneSignal/emoji-picker"&gt;emoji-picker&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pros:&lt;/strong&gt; Fun to try out with the kids as they build web pages for themselves (which they are interested in). I think I’d like the aesthetic of it. I see a lot of advantage in simplifying compositional tools for&amp;nbsp;kids&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cons:&lt;/strong&gt; Deployment can be annoying. Glitch makes it easy to get a site up, but not &lt;a href="https://support.glitch.com/t/simple-owner-writable-storage/30364/15"&gt;easy to build editors&lt;/a&gt;, so any &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CMS&lt;/span&gt; has to be a whole production. Kids might only play with it a little then we all forget&amp;nbsp;it&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span id="computing-home"&gt;Can computing feel like it has a sense of space, a&amp;nbsp;home?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I’ve tried to interrogate my own sense of nostalgia in computing, something I’ve wanted to recapture is the sense of space and a home in your own computer. A hard disk or even a set of floppy disks give this sense of a place, where you acquire and place things, and where you move around. BBSs had similar feelings, even if it was a clubhouse instead of a home. This was part of the early web as well, but now the web is like visiting a public space. I can visit Facebook, Google Drive, or any other social forum, but I’m just a&amp;nbsp;visitor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m especially noticing this while watching kids use iOS and Chrome &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OS&lt;/span&gt;, where the experience feels particularly generic and&amp;nbsp;impersonal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t know how to bring back this sense of personal place. I know it’s not flat, reorderable lists. It’s not algorithmically ranked items. Maybe it’s important to be spacial. Or maybe it’s just important that it’s sticky and personally constructed. A place with personal paths,&amp;nbsp;rediscovery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pros:&lt;/strong&gt; This is an attribute I’d like to have in things-I-make, and I think there might be general lessons to be learned. So even if I come up with something that doesn’t work well or I abandon, I think I will have learned&amp;nbsp;something&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cons:&lt;/strong&gt; I don’t know what I’m looking for or how to know it when I find&amp;nbsp;it&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span id="program-your-parent"&gt;Program your parent: a board&amp;nbsp;game&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is similar to &lt;a href="http://www.robotturtles.com/"&gt;Robot Turtles&lt;/a&gt;, but relies on the parent to be the&amp;nbsp;computer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like Robot Turtles the programs are built with cards. Though maybe it would involve more printable and consumable cards (e.g., things you write numbers on, or “functions” that are a page with slots for&amp;nbsp;parameters).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I imagine two possible goals: one is simply to make your parent do silly things. The second is to solve puzzles, both specifically and generally. (Maybe the puzzle prize is to get your parent to do something silly, like you win silly&amp;nbsp;card/routines)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is going to rely on the parent both faithfully executing programs, and doing it with enough transparency to help their child debug the&amp;nbsp;program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pros:&lt;/strong&gt; Fun to do with the kids. Easy to&amp;nbsp;share&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cons:&lt;/strong&gt; I don’t want to create yet another puzzle-based beginner programming&amp;nbsp;thing&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span id="scratch-extension"&gt;Create a Scratch&amp;nbsp;extension&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can &lt;a href="https://en.scratch-wiki.info/wiki/Scratch_Extension"&gt;build extensions to Scratch&lt;/a&gt;. Some speech-related extensions would be easy to imagine. There’s also &lt;a href="https://snap.berkeley.edu/"&gt;Snap!&lt;/a&gt; to&amp;nbsp;consider.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve also wanted an equation block, that doesn’t require dragging a ton of math-related blocks together to make a simple equation like &lt;code&gt;100 - (x / 4)&lt;/code&gt;. I bet it wouldn’t be too hard. The fact variable names are free text and editable does make it harder though, not to mention the fundamentally unnamed aspect of many getters. Maybe this is a bad&amp;nbsp;idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pros:&lt;/strong&gt; Without too much work I could make an interesting change to a programming environment my kids&amp;nbsp;enjoy&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cons:&lt;/strong&gt; It’s hard to distribute extensions. Probably what I learn won’t be generalizable to anything&amp;nbsp;else&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span id="natural-language"&gt;Natural&amp;nbsp;language&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span id="chat-bot-builder"&gt;Chat bot&amp;nbsp;builder&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think it would be cool to let the kids write a little chat bot. Wiring it up on the web is really easy (well, easy in&amp;nbsp;Chrome).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve already extracted a &lt;a href="https://github.com/ianb/phrase-matcher"&gt;library from Firefox Voice&lt;/a&gt; and played around with a site on&amp;nbsp;Glitch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to allow some of the programming to happen as part of the dialog. For instance, if the bot doesn’t respond well, you should be able to say: “you should have said [X]”, and add to the program on the&amp;nbsp;fly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve had a hard time focusing the kids on question of what kind of entity they’d like to create. Does it have a personality? Does it have a&amp;nbsp;purpose?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pros:&lt;/strong&gt; I have all the pieces, and it’s stuff I’ve been doing lately. Simple and hopefully&amp;nbsp;fun&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cons:&lt;/strong&gt; The kids aren’t as excited about this as I think they should be. Not sure about the phrase matching, but I don’t want to turn this into&amp;nbsp;Dialogflow&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span id="intent-parser-if"&gt;Use an intent parser to build a text&amp;nbsp;adventure&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I checked out and did some tests with intent parsers while making Firefox Voice, but I never actually seriously used one. If I did use one it would be &lt;a href="https://rasa.com/"&gt;Rasa&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Making a text adventure (ahem, writing &lt;em&gt;Interactive Fiction&lt;/em&gt;) using an intent parser seems interesting. Parsing always frustrated me as a user, and maybe these new techniques can&amp;nbsp;help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pros:&lt;/strong&gt; Fills out my domain knowledge a bit, while also using things I’ve somewhat familiar with. The result should be fun and&amp;nbsp;playful&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cons:&lt;/strong&gt; I don’t have a story idea! Publishing something based on Rasa may be hard (since I don’t want to maintain a&amp;nbsp;server)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span id="voice-news-reader"&gt;Voice-activated news&amp;nbsp;reader&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the concepts from my work in Consumer Voice Products was a voice-activated news reader. It would be a way to browse newsy sites and get articles read to you, with a voice interface to control the read back (“skip”, “summarize”, “expand” etc). The ideal place to do this is on the phone, as a kind of podcast alternative, but deploying on the phone requires lots of boring engineering I’m uninterested&amp;nbsp;in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So instead I could try making it in the browser. Maybe I could use &lt;a href="https://github.com/castorini/howl"&gt;Howl&lt;/a&gt; or something based on &lt;a href="https://ai.googleblog.com/2017/08/launching-speech-commands-dataset.html"&gt;Speech Commands&lt;/a&gt; for voice recognition. Or just leave the mic open for transcription as a prototype phase, though feedback might make that&amp;nbsp;impossible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Give me my daily update” is a common home voice assistant feature, but it does nothing for me. I imagine this as something you’d interact with as an alternative to&amp;nbsp;radio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pros:&lt;/strong&gt; I don’t think this would require a lot of work to prototype. I think the idea is a good one. It could be an interesting&amp;nbsp;demo&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cons:&lt;/strong&gt; I think it will rely on &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keyword_spotting"&gt;keyword spotting&lt;/a&gt; and it’s not feasible for me to collect new words to train models, so my commands will have to rely on what’s already out there. Also maybe this isn’t&amp;nbsp;fun&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span id="mock-language-interface"&gt;Mock out a broad natural language&amp;nbsp;interface&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What if we did most of our computing using natural language? This is mostly a brainstorming exercise. Take a some typical computer interactions and reimagine them entirely with natural&amp;nbsp;language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The result probably imagines a refactored experience. Things that are distinct steps now would be combined, while other situations would require conversational or other multi-step interactions. It might imply new things, like named staging locations, or other&amp;nbsp;shortcuts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pros:&lt;/strong&gt; I think there’s a certain naiveté to our voice interfaces, but I don’t know what we’d even be trying to get to. Maybe I’d have some more&amp;nbsp;ideas?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cons:&lt;/strong&gt; The result is just… a blog&amp;nbsp;post?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span id="brain-in-a-jar"&gt;Brain-in-a-jar dialog&amp;nbsp;game&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The premise: a person has had their consciousness extracted, or at least simulated in a computer. You, a temp/Mechanical Turk, have been hired to make this artificial consciousness feel better. If it realizes it is a robot it will be&amp;nbsp;rebooted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Technically I’m not sure how to do much of this. But it could be fun to try. Different utterances would increase or decrease the existential skepticism&amp;nbsp;points.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pros:&lt;/strong&gt; Learn some more &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NLP&lt;/span&gt;. Play around with fictional emotional ideas. Maybe I can share a rough playable&amp;nbsp;game&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cons:&lt;/strong&gt; I’m not sure how to drive a useful plot forward. There’s a game design aspect that I know nothing&amp;nbsp;about&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span id="interview-chatbot"&gt;Interview&amp;nbsp;chatbot&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not a job interview! This chatbot doesn’t pretend to be human, doesn’t even pretend to really talk to you. Instead it interviews you. It asks questions, maybe asks followup questions, and saves the responses. Might operate better over email than chat. Make your own oral&amp;nbsp;history!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pros:&lt;/strong&gt; I think I would like the result of this. Self-documentation is important. It would be easy to manually (Wizard Of Oz)&amp;nbsp;prototype&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cons:&lt;/strong&gt; Most people (including myself) will just try it for a week or two then forget about it, or worse feel guilty for not&amp;nbsp;continuing&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span id="emotional-tamagotchi"&gt;Emotional&amp;nbsp;Tamagotchi&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your little entity/bot gets lonely and sad. Instead of feeding it fake food and whatnot, you must feed it emotional support and positive&amp;nbsp;feelings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Secretly it’s all sent to actual sad people to make them happy. A language transformer covers up the&amp;nbsp;humanity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nah, I probably wouldn’t do the second&amp;nbsp;part.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pros:&lt;/strong&gt; Kind of easy. Maybe involves plugging existing models together. I’m curious what it would feel like to&amp;nbsp;use&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cons:&lt;/strong&gt; Easy to hack. Lacks actual emotional&amp;nbsp;core&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span id="programming-languages"&gt;Programming&amp;nbsp;languages&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span id="new-programming-syntax"&gt;Try to come up with a new category of programming&amp;nbsp;syntax&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s only a few syntaxes in programming&amp;nbsp;languages:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Algol&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lisp&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Forth&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Smalltalk&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;APL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;SQL&lt;/span&gt;?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People keep revisiting these basic syntaxes, and even then it’s like a power law of popularity. Just out of curiosity, are there other things we could&amp;nbsp;try?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.textfiles.com/bitsavers/pdf/xerox/alto/Smalltalk72_Manual.pdf"&gt;Smalltalk-72&lt;/a&gt; had some interesting ideas. It was very expansive and inclusive. Smalltalk-76 (which is pretty much what we have today) pulled a small core out of that, but maybe there’s other foundations of syntax to be mined from those&amp;nbsp;ideas?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would probably just use this as a brainstorming exercise, and then mock up some results and write a blog&amp;nbsp;post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pros:&lt;/strong&gt; Pretty simple and finite. Hopefully fun. If I can’t come up with anything, so it&amp;nbsp;goes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cons:&lt;/strong&gt; Just a silly little&amp;nbsp;exercise&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span id="functional-core-notebook"&gt;Functional core&amp;nbsp;notebook&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Order of execution is a common problem in notebooks, as well as experimentation. Notebooks are often exploratory, and you want to try different versions of functions and&amp;nbsp;processes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This would be a lot easier with functional and deterministic code. You could memoize results and understand&amp;nbsp;dependencies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also feel like lots of the imperative and stateful parts of notebooks are the setup, such as acquiring data. So I imagine a kind of “shell” in the notebook where you do imperative setup and the cells where you reshape data and do&amp;nbsp;calculations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The name has some similarity to &lt;a href="https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/screencasts/catalog/functional-core-imperative-shell"&gt;Functional Core, Imperative Shell&lt;/a&gt; and probably some similar motivations, but encodes the idea directly into the tool and&amp;nbsp;languages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m wondering if I could do this with a deterministic subset of Python. Things like “import” are environment setup, and maybe even function definitions, while there’s innards that are&amp;nbsp;deterministic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It may be &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OK&lt;/span&gt; for the code to stateful, &lt;em&gt;if&lt;/em&gt; the statefulness is part of the analysis. That is, you could have a cell&amp;nbsp;like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;most_populous_cities&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;city&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;all_cities&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;most_populous_cities&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;push&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;((&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;city&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;“&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;population&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;city&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;“&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;most_populous_cities&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;sort&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;It both creates a new global variable, &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; modifies it in place. But if &lt;code&gt;all_cities&lt;/code&gt; is the same then the result of this calculation will be the same. You could consider its input to be &lt;code&gt;[all_cities]&lt;/code&gt; and its output is an addition to the environment &lt;code&gt;[most_populous_cities]&lt;/code&gt;. (Also &lt;code&gt;city&lt;/code&gt; is set and almost certainly is not important, but that’s the kind of detail we’d need to figure out. Also it’s not &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OK&lt;/span&gt; for another cell to modify &lt;code&gt;most_populous_cities&lt;/code&gt; – modifications need to create new global&amp;nbsp;variables.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think &lt;a href="https://observablehq.com/"&gt;Observable&lt;/a&gt; has bits of this in its&amp;nbsp;concept?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pros:&lt;/strong&gt; I’ve &lt;a href="https://www.ianbicking.org/blog/2018/11/viewing-python-execution-source-code-rewriting.html"&gt;played with ASTs&lt;/a&gt; and found it interesting and productive, and this general concept is one I’ve been thinking about for a long&amp;nbsp;time&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cons:&lt;/strong&gt; Do I make a new notebook interface? Maybe… and maybe it’s okay if it’s scrappy, but it’s kind of a&amp;nbsp;distraction&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span id="symbolic-execution"&gt;Something with symbolic&amp;nbsp;execution&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve never seriously done symbolic execution or even used it. But I’ve found the &lt;a href="https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2019/05/what-weve-built-is-a-computational-language-and-thats-very-important/"&gt;Wolfram Language&lt;/a&gt; interesting, and find it really interesting as something quite distinct from more formal functional&amp;nbsp;languages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I guess I should check out &lt;a href="https://github.com/ksluckow/awesome-symbolic-execution"&gt;this list&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.sympy.org/en/index.html"&gt;SymPy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://github.com/bannsec/pySym"&gt;pySym&lt;/a&gt; (?!?), &lt;a href="https://www.sagemath.org/"&gt;Sage&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://github.com/ExpoSEJS/ExpoSE"&gt;ExpoSE&lt;/a&gt; (JavaScript), &lt;a href="https://prepack.io/"&gt;Prepack&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;JS&lt;/span&gt; partial evaluation), &lt;a href="https://peval.readthedocs.io/en/latest/"&gt;peval&lt;/a&gt; (Python partial&amp;nbsp;evaluation).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pros:&lt;/strong&gt; There’s lots of material to start with, and it’s easy to come up with early experiments. It’s the kind of problem I can sit down and tackle for a day at a&amp;nbsp;time&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cons:&lt;/strong&gt; Not very human-centric. Lots of prior art is actually about a kind of speculative execution of binaries for security checking, which I find&amp;nbsp;boring&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;span id="reverse-execution"&gt;Attempt to reverse&amp;nbsp;execution&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given a return value from a function, what inputs or actions might have led to&amp;nbsp;that?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I presume this is pretty hard, and possibilities explode quickly. But I’d like to understand &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; it is hard, and the easiest way might be to try until I&amp;nbsp;fail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This will require new “possibility” objects, and probably kinds of partial evaluation (partial&amp;nbsp;unevaluation?).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe I’d pick a subset of JavaScript (maybe Python) and use the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AST&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pros:&lt;/strong&gt; I can just jump in and&amp;nbsp;start&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cons:&lt;/strong&gt; I know the result is failure! I just don’t know where and&amp;nbsp;when&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span id="partial-evaluation"&gt;Partial evaluation as the execution&amp;nbsp;engine&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think this might be what I actually am thinking of when I think of &lt;a href="#symbolic-execution"&gt;symbolic execution&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Partial evaluation is taking an expression and evaluating the parts you already know. So if you see&amp;nbsp;this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# My apologies for this lazily constructed example...&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;calculate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;y&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;y&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nb"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;Answer:&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;calculate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;some_func&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Then you can look at how &lt;code&gt;calculate()&lt;/code&gt; is called with one known value (&lt;code&gt;10&lt;/code&gt;) and then see that &lt;code&gt;if x:&lt;/code&gt; will be true, and so on, reducing it all to &lt;code&gt;print("Answer:", 20)&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are limitations to how well you can do this in an imperative language. For instance in this case we&amp;#8217;ve optimized away the call to &lt;code&gt;some_func()&lt;/code&gt;, and that might not be correct: the function might actually do something important, even if its return value is thrown&amp;nbsp;away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this is also a feature: by eliminating &lt;code&gt;some_func()&lt;/code&gt; you can simplify the program, or at least find the simpler specific program that lives in the complete&amp;nbsp;program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A long, long, long time ago I made something called &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080512151939/http://www.colorstudy.com/software/tcl-scheme/"&gt;&lt;code&gt;tcl-&amp;gt;scheme&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that was a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TCL&lt;/span&gt; interpreter written in functional Scheme, with the idea that if you apply partial evaluation you can compile &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TCL&lt;/span&gt; into Scheme. This only works to the degree that &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TCL&lt;/span&gt; doesn&amp;#8217;t use overly dynamic features (like &lt;a href="https://www.tcl.tk/man/tcl8.6/TclCmd/eval.htm"&gt;eval&lt;/a&gt;), but even if it does you still have a working intepreter to fall back&amp;nbsp;on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe combined with the &lt;a href="#functional-core-notebook"&gt;functional core&lt;/a&gt; notebook concept this could create something&amp;nbsp;interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To take this a bit&amp;nbsp;further:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The language has to have the ability to be expanded out into expressions. &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S-expression"&gt;S-Expressions&lt;/a&gt; are very appealing, though more eclectic syntaxes aren&amp;#8217;t &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; much worse. But Python&amp;#8217;s indentation-based syntax is&amp;nbsp;problematic.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All objects need source code representations. It&amp;#8217;s important to me that we can turn all the intermediate forms into actual source code, to see how the source actually evolves. &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;SomeObject at 0x0292a43e&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; isn&amp;#8217;t going to&amp;nbsp;work.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;But maybe representations can also be richer than&amp;nbsp;text.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It would be nice to track where literals came from, and use that to detect if they are&amp;nbsp;editable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It would be interesting to include tracking information so you could see why an object became what it&amp;nbsp;is.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There doesn&amp;#8217;t have to be any undefined errors: if you refer to something that doesn&amp;#8217;t exist it could be an as-yet-unspecified input. Or code that hasn&amp;#8217;t been written yet. The system can &amp;#8220;think about&amp;#8221; (partially evaluate!) incomplete&amp;nbsp;code.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Because execution happens opportunistically the language can&amp;#8217;t be imperative, it can&amp;#8217;t be a sequence of things being executed. Technically it &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt;, and partial evaluation systems can take that into account, but the rewritten code is too complex for our&amp;nbsp;purposes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can imagine a multiple worlds execution, and doing diffs of the result. If I have three different inputs, and diff the resulting partially evaluated programs, what do I get? If I have two implementations of a function, how do they change the overall execution? This could be an interesting way to think about code&amp;nbsp;changes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There&amp;#8217;s going to be lots of &amp;#8220;smart&amp;#8221; primitives: routines that are built into the execution engine and know how to execute the source itself. There&amp;#8217;s definitely a powerful and general execution engine (the thing I write), and a much less powerful user-programmable expression&amp;nbsp;engine.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think &lt;a href="http://www.textfiles.com/bitsavers/pdf/xerox/alto/Smalltalk72_Manual.pdf"&gt;Smalltalk-72&lt;/a&gt; played around with these ideas, and looking into it would be&amp;nbsp;helpful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The JavaScript parsing and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AST&lt;/span&gt;-rewriting ecosystem is healthy, and I think I could use it as a starting&amp;nbsp;point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pros:&lt;/strong&gt; I&amp;#8217;ve thought about this a long time, and writing it down makes me excited. This is fun&amp;nbsp;programming&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cons:&lt;/strong&gt; I&amp;#8217;m not sure I can get it to be a useful environment (simply because it&amp;#8217;s a lot of work), and if it&amp;#8217;s not useful then I can&amp;#8217;t confirm the utility of the concept&amp;nbsp;itself&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve started on this some, using &lt;a href="https://github.com/benjamn/recast"&gt;Recast&lt;/a&gt; to operate on JavaScript ASTs. Working in &lt;a href="https://github.com/ianb/partial-language"&gt;github/ianb/partial-language&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right now it&amp;#8217;s stuck to JavaScript syntax, though not necessarily JavaScript semantics. I expect this may be a problem. A series of transformations looks&amp;nbsp;like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Original input, note order of declaration is not important:&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;?&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;func&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;y&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kr"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;func&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;p&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;p&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;**&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Rewrite 1 (function and variable definitions consumed and remembered):&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;?&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;func&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;y&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Rewrite 2 (x and func substituted):&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="o"&gt;?&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;((&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;p&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;p&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;**&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="p"&gt;})(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;y&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Rewrite 3 (1 == 1 substituted, parameter moved into function):&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kc"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="o"&gt;?&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="kr"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;p&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;p&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;**&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="p"&gt;})()&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;y&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Rewrite 4 (?: evaluated, p substituted):&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;(()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;10&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;**&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;})();&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Rewrite 5 (arrow function with one return removed):&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;10&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;**&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Rewrite 6 (math):&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;100&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Rewrite 7 (more math):&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;25&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Rewrite 8 (last math):&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="mi"&gt;26&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s cute, doesn&amp;#8217;t take too much code. I&amp;#8217;m not sure how far it can go. Having more control of the syntax would be nice, for instance substituting &lt;code&gt;func(10)&lt;/code&gt; for an inline arrow function is not the best, but there aren&amp;#8217;t block expressions in&amp;nbsp;JavaScript.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span id="ai"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;AI&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span id="binocular-vision"&gt;Binocular vision and image&amp;nbsp;processing&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For some reason &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binocular_vision"&gt;binocular vision&lt;/a&gt; isn’t a common tool in robots and vision. Different distance-sensing tools like &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lidar"&gt;Lidar&lt;/a&gt; seem more common. Lidar is more expensive, but it creates a concrete depth field. But is a depth field even enough? It seems interesting to actually include visual information and depth information&amp;nbsp;together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m specifically interested in how binocular vision works with &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolutional_neural_network"&gt;Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)&lt;/a&gt;. CNNs are the standard tool in image processing, where you have a neural network where you not only train some kind of detection, but you also have a bunch of “convolutional” layers that are essentially image processors. These typically learn to find edges or other features in the image, by using a “windows” (fixed size squares, 3x3, 5x5 etc, taken from the image) and training matrices that process those windows. (I guess for this case wide windows would make sense, there&amp;#8217;s no need for the windows to be&amp;nbsp;square.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a typical setup you pass in a red, blue, and green layer, and you let the training process discover things like the meaning of color. And if color isn’t important then it can learn to just add them all together. Instead of these three layers, you could just pass in six: red-left, blue-left, green-left, red-right, blue-right, green-right. And then the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CNN&lt;/span&gt; can learn how to use the differences between those layers to understand its&amp;nbsp;environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first thing I’d have to do is create a binocular camera. There’s some expensive options intended for robots. Unfortunately I can’t fit two &lt;a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/camera-module-v2/"&gt;Raspberry Pi cameras&lt;/a&gt; on a single unit. Maybe I just need two cheap &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USB&lt;/span&gt; cameras. Or maybe there’s a clever way using mirrors to turn a single camera into a binocular&amp;nbsp;camera?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next I have to figure out a training process. What am I even training for? One possibility might be to use an ultrasonic distance sensor to get a real distance, and then just train a model to see if it can predict that number from the image. The ultrasonic sensors aren’t very accurate and only see a small cone, so I’m not sure if it’s great training data. But if I train it to make a depth field, and only train to the part of the image that I have a measurement for, will it magically give accurate numbers for the other positions? It would be better if I had a full task in mind to train&amp;nbsp;against.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pros:&lt;/strong&gt; It’s kind of interesting, it’s nice to think about real physical things instead of just information on the&amp;nbsp;web&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cons:&lt;/strong&gt; Figuring out how to get images and ground truth data for training is hard, I don’t have many&amp;nbsp;ideas&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span id="nn-from-scratch"&gt;Neural networks from&amp;nbsp;scratch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I took a course that covered neural networks, and it was &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OK&lt;/span&gt; – it got me to go through a bunch of exercises and covered the material in a somewhat structured way. There’s a huge amount more I could try to do as a practitioner: learn PyTorch, try different architectures, do more data shaping and feature selection, etc. But there’s also the basic theory, some of which I felt pretty comfortable with, but not all. Backpropagation especially: I get that a differentiable algorithm is useful, and in theory how that would lead to backpropagation, but there are &lt;em&gt;so many&lt;/em&gt; details that are vague in my&amp;nbsp;mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Building a neural network system from scratch seems like a great way to solidify my theoretical understanding, even if I’ll never again work at that level and just use frameworks in any practical&amp;nbsp;setting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve seen a couple resources on this: &lt;a href="https://nnfs.io/"&gt;Neural Networks From Scratch&lt;/a&gt;, a more casual &lt;a href="https://victorzhou.com/blog/intro-to-neural-networks/"&gt;Machine Learning for Beginners: An Introduction to Neural Networks&lt;/a&gt; (with another &lt;a href="https://victorzhou.com/blog/intro-to-rnns/"&gt;for RNNs&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://victorzhou.com/blog/intro-to-cnns-part-1/"&gt;CNNs&lt;/a&gt;), a similar &lt;a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-build-your-own-neural-network-from-scratch-in-python-68998a08e4f6"&gt;How to build your own Neural Network from scratch in Python&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://enlight.nyc/projects/neural-network"&gt;another&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pros:&lt;/strong&gt; I can just follow along with someone else’s instruction. I’m pretty sure what I learn will be useful to&amp;nbsp;me&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cons:&lt;/strong&gt; Not directly&amp;nbsp;creative&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span id="not-computing"&gt;Not (just)&amp;nbsp;computing&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span id="physical-workspace"&gt;Physical workspace&amp;nbsp;optimizations&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In most ways my computing behavior has become less optimized and more aligned with broad consumer trends over time. This is a result of (a) not being willing to spend time customizing things, and (b) wanting to experience normal things so I can relate to normal computer&amp;nbsp;users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there’s a part of me that thinks I’ve overdone it. Maybe micro-optimization are silly, but they can also be a tool to focus. The awkward in-between experiences in a computer are genuinely dangerous for focus. I feel my mental load is finite, and using it up on stupid window fiddling and such spends down my mental&amp;nbsp;capacity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m interested in what it might look like to customize my physical environment. Things like the &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/professional/blog/look-back-bloomberg-keyboard/"&gt;Bloomberg Terminal keyboard&lt;/a&gt; are interesting, or &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/comments/be23vc/vintage_newspaper_editing_terminal_keyboard/"&gt;an editing keyboard&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://relivesight.com/projects/433/"&gt;what have you&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Minimal keyboards are kind of the style right now (I’m using one myself). But maybe that’s a silly optimization. Lots of stuff on a 101 key keyboard isn’t for me: function keys I don’t use, a number pad I don’t use. Does it actually follow that lots of keys aren’t useful? Or is it that I haven’t put in the time to make sure the keys are useful for &lt;em&gt;me&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s pretty easy to just add more &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USB&lt;/span&gt; devices. I can have multiple keyboards attached, multiple mice and trackpads. I don’t have to assemble a single custom device (which I’ve decided is infeasible), I can just throw things together, apply some labels. Maybe it’ll just be &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CqOtEz6PfA"&gt;silly&lt;/a&gt; but I don’t&amp;nbsp;know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One goal would be to use keys for “absolute” controls. As an example instance ⌘-[ moves one tab to the left (very relative), while ⌘-1 moves to the first tab of the active window (somewhat relative). Instead I want a “focus Gmail” key, and my current focus shouldn’t&amp;nbsp;matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obviously there&amp;#8217;s a lot of general physical arrangement to be figured out as&amp;nbsp;well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These &lt;a href="https://www.1upkeyboards.com/shop/keyboard-kits/macro-pads/sweet-16-macro-pad-black/"&gt;16 key kits&lt;/a&gt; seem like an interesting macro option. Interesting things &lt;a href="https://www.gboards.ca/"&gt;here too&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Progress&lt;/strong&gt;: I&amp;#8217;m trying switching back to my old &lt;a href="https://kinesis-ergo.com/shop/advantage2/"&gt;Kinesis Advantage keyboard&lt;/a&gt;. The actual keyboard is a bit old and smushy and not 100% reliable, so I might have to re-up if I decide I like it. I&amp;#8217;m not sure I do? The movements come back quickly though. Interestingly you can fit the Apple Magic Trackpad in the space between the two hand-wells. I&amp;#8217;m not sure if that&amp;#8217;s actually an&amp;nbsp;improvement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m trying to make it easier to move between sitting, standing, and using a treadmill. I&amp;#8217;ve had the treadmill a long time, but haven&amp;#8217;t used it that much because it means moving from one workspace to another. This is &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OK&lt;/span&gt;, but puts my productivity in conflict with healthy body positions. That&amp;#8217;s not a good way to set oneself up to make healthy choices. So instead I&amp;#8217;ve made a platform that can be slid over the treadmill, with a chair on top, and I move that back and forth while everything else stays in&amp;nbsp;place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pros:&lt;/strong&gt; I&amp;#8217;ll become an expert hacker! Maybe I can type with a different keyboard for each hand. Cryptic neon-green characters will flow from my&amp;nbsp;screen&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cons:&lt;/strong&gt; It makes my environment less portable. I might not like the&amp;nbsp;result&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span id="executive-function"&gt;Something involving executive&amp;nbsp;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This probably starts with study, and leads… somewhere I can’t determine right now. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ianbicking/status/1299131871356489731"&gt;I&amp;#8217;m just starting to think about these&amp;nbsp;things.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m very interested in the mental models that underly our&amp;nbsp;action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pros:&lt;/strong&gt; I’m pretty sure I could use what I learn in almost anything I do. I’m sure there’s important theory for me to&amp;nbsp;learn&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cons:&lt;/strong&gt; This doesn’t satisfy my desire to make. That desire is&amp;nbsp;considerable&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span id="sms-watch"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;SMS&lt;/span&gt;-based dispatch system for the local neighborhood&amp;nbsp;watch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s a &lt;a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2020/09/07/we-can-solve-our-own-problems-a-vision-of-minneapolis-without-police"&gt;watch/patrol/safety group&lt;/a&gt; in my neighborhood. It’s a little unclear how residents can get in contact. I played around with some text automation using &lt;a href="https://www.integromat.com/"&gt;Integromat&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.twilio.com/"&gt;Twilio&lt;/a&gt; and while some parts were quirky, it wasn’t too hard to do, nor very expensive to maintain. Maybe I could set something up for the group using&amp;nbsp;this?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pros:&lt;/strong&gt; Helps connect me more with the neighborhood. Right now safety is an important political issue, and this particular effort seems concrete and positive. The hard parts are all in working with and designing with these other people that I don’t know&amp;nbsp;well&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cons:&lt;/strong&gt; Nothing particularly technically involved. Doesn’t let me do the kid of somewhat reclusive and focused work I’m looking&amp;nbsp;for&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span id="southside-greenway"&gt;Freshen up Southside Greenway&amp;nbsp;proposal&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some people made a &lt;a href="https://www.ourstreetsmpls.org/southsidegreenway"&gt;pretty involved proposal to turn my street into a greenway&lt;/a&gt;. That would be totally incredible, even though it feels outside of the bounds of what we can imagine in this city right now given everything else that is going&amp;nbsp;on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The proposal has a lot of good work, embedded in a pretty hard to find location. I could make a site and take that content and maybe help keep it alive in the&amp;nbsp;process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pros:&lt;/strong&gt; The material is all there, so this feels like there’s a lot of leverage to the&amp;nbsp;work&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cons:&lt;/strong&gt; The material is all there&amp;nbsp;already&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span id="correspondence"&gt;Long-form slow-paced email correspondence&amp;nbsp;platform&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reading about famous correspondences of the past, I am somewhat jealous. We have social media but it’s a little light on interpersonal communication. Obviously we can just communicate, just do it, but I do think there’s something useful about an understood and agreed-upon structure with some supports and&amp;nbsp;reminders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m thinking about correspondence that is rate-limited to once per week. So if I receive your letter on September 1st, I can send a reply any time but it can’t possibly arrive before September 8th. This is the opposite of texting. Because of these shared expectations the conversation never has to “finish” but it also isn’t left&amp;nbsp;dangling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is probably best prototyped with a couple people and no actual&amp;nbsp;automation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pros:&lt;/strong&gt; Prototyping would also presumably lead to some interesting correspondences. The whole thing is very&amp;nbsp;simple&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cons:&lt;/strong&gt; Well, I do have to find people to prototype it with. What if it turns out to be boring? Or one of us ghosts the other one? Is this a guilt&amp;nbsp;factory?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span id="game-word"&gt;Game&amp;nbsp;world&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultima_VI:_The_False_Prophet"&gt;Ultima &lt;span class="caps"&gt;VI&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; really caught my imagination as a child. Mostly because it felt both complex and comprehensible: you could see the implementation, but it still felt&amp;nbsp;alive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nostalgia and escapism makes me want to recreate that kind of simple emergence. A little world that can exist without me and yet is by me. Tiny beings with their own tiny internal&amp;nbsp;world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m sure there’s game frameworks that would be a great basis for this, but there’s &lt;em&gt;so many options&lt;/em&gt; that I’m a little lost. What abstract level lets me do the parts I am excited about and skip the parts I&amp;#8217;m not interested&amp;nbsp;in?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pros:&lt;/strong&gt; This has been in my head much longer than any of these other ideas! It feels&amp;nbsp;fun&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cons:&lt;/strong&gt; Escapist and it’s unlikely to lead&amp;nbsp;anywhere&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Possible resources: &lt;a href="https://github.com/ericoporto/fgmk"&gt;fgmk - game and editor&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://github.com/ericoporto/fgmkJsEngine"&gt;fgmk engine&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://make8bitart.com/"&gt;pixel editor&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.reldens.com/"&gt;Reldens top-down &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MMORPG&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://thenyanta.github.io/JS-RPG-Engine/"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;JS&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RPG&lt;/span&gt; engine&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://github.com/topics/rpg-engine"&gt;GitHub category&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Games/Techniques/Tilemaps/Square_tilemaps_implementation%3A_Scrolling_maps"&gt;tutorial on &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MDN&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.creativebloq.com/html5/build-tile-based-html5-game-31410992"&gt;another tutorial&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://victorribeiro.com/tileEditor/?example=01"&gt;tile editor&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://opengameart.org/"&gt;artwork&lt;/a&gt;, especially &lt;a href="https://lpc.opengameart.org/content/liberated-pixel-cup-faq"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;LPC&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span id="remembrance-agent"&gt;Remembrance&amp;nbsp;Agent&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I came upon this concept in an &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2015/02/13/385793862/computer-or-human-thad"&gt;Invisibilia podcast episode&lt;/a&gt;, where they talked to Thad Starner about his 90s personal wearable note-taking tool, the &lt;a href="https://alumni.media.mit.edu/~rhodes/Papers/remembrance.html"&gt;Remembrance Agent&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea of note-taking and retrieval is simple enough, but as presented the tone feels different from other note taking, more stream of consciousness, more about connecting the present self to the past self. Maybe it’s just the word “remembrance” that sticks with&amp;nbsp;me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I honestly don’t know what I would do in this area. Maybe nothing, but I like &lt;em&gt;thinking&lt;/em&gt; about doing&amp;nbsp;something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pros:&lt;/strong&gt; Seems&amp;nbsp;cool&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cons:&lt;/strong&gt; What am I doing&amp;nbsp;again?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span id="arcology"&gt;Arcology requirements and&amp;nbsp;constraints&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might know &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arcology"&gt;arcologies&lt;/a&gt; from SimCity. I encountered &lt;a href="https://www.organism.earth/library/document/arcology"&gt;Arcology: The City In The Image of Man&lt;/a&gt; in my college library’s oversized book section. Or one of Buckminster Fuller’s proposals like the &lt;a href="https://www.historyandheadlines.com/east-st-louis-and-the-old-man-river-project/"&gt;Old Man River&amp;#8217;s City project&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s an old fantasy and it seems entirely unreasonable – even undesirable – now. But I still wonder… there’s all these visual concepts, but what would it really require in practice? What amount of space or energy is required for the mechanics? What kind of movement and transportation is required? How much intake of material would a community need? What kinds of&amp;nbsp;services?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I guess the result would be a&amp;nbsp;spreadsheet?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pros:&lt;/strong&gt; Not computers, something different. Fairly accessible research&amp;nbsp;process&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cons:&lt;/strong&gt; Not sure what I’d do with the&amp;nbsp;result&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span id="fractals"&gt;Play with&amp;nbsp;fractals&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What’s the state of the art in fractals these days? And &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaos_theory"&gt;chaos theory&lt;/a&gt;? These were fun exciting new things in the&amp;nbsp;90s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While it’s kind of an aside, I came upon &lt;a href="https://blog.scottlogic.com/2019/05/17/webassembly-compiler.html"&gt;this tutorial for compiling to &lt;span class="caps"&gt;WASM&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that looked interesting. It steps through creating a simple language (tokenizer, parser) and compiling it directly to &lt;span class="caps"&gt;WASM&lt;/span&gt;. The example language it uses it suitable for rendering the Mandelbrot set (and not a lot else), but extending it only for other fractals would probably be feasible and&amp;nbsp;interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pros:&lt;/strong&gt; It would be nice to get clearer on &lt;span class="caps"&gt;WASM&lt;/span&gt;, and fun to do a project around&amp;nbsp;it&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cons:&lt;/strong&gt; I could probably just look up some fractal explorers, play with them, and call it a&amp;nbsp;day&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span id="fiction"&gt;Write&amp;nbsp;fiction&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve twice tried and failed &lt;a href="https://nanowrimo.org/"&gt;Nanowrimo&lt;/a&gt;. Maybe I should try it again? Fantastical alternate reality or absurdist political&amp;nbsp;thriller?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pros:&lt;/strong&gt; I do think about this often. Unlike many things here it’s not something I’d satisfy in my professional life. It’s escapist, disconnected from the current&amp;nbsp;moment&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cons:&lt;/strong&gt; It’s really big task and has no outward result unless I finished, which is unlikely. Maybe I’m between jobs, but even doing silly projects does move me forward in my career, even if it only clarifies my own feelings towards my work. It’s escapist, disconnected from the current&amp;nbsp;moment&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span id="beliefs"&gt;Document my&amp;nbsp;beliefs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think I believe things, but what are those things anyway? If I write them down maybe I’ll find&amp;nbsp;out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pros:&lt;/strong&gt; I think about these issues often, and am constantly trying (and am overwhelmed) to determine what my place is in the world. I’m going to put that effort in regardless, but doing so in a conscious and structured way might at least move me&amp;nbsp;forward&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cons:&lt;/strong&gt; Maybe I’m &lt;a href="https://www.theredhandfiles.com/the-lyrics-just-arent-coming/"&gt;not ready&lt;/a&gt; to decide what I believe, maybe it simply has not yet arrived? Is this indulgent? It would probably not be fun, it would be hard&amp;nbsp;work&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span id="conclusion"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that I&amp;#8217;ve written all these down I&amp;#8217;m worried I won&amp;#8217;t get through any of them (except hopefully a job). Am I looking to expand my own thinking, my own skills, make something that is fun, or something that has future&amp;nbsp;potential?&lt;/p&gt;

If there&amp;#8217;s a thread that connects them maybe I&amp;#8217;ll find it, or maybe this is just a scattering of&amp;nbsp;work&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span id="redline-review"&gt;1. Redline&amp;nbsp;Review&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was my first real application, written in the early 2000s, coming out of a consulting engagement I had with a &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fitzroy_Dearborn_Publishers"&gt;now-defunct encyclopedia publisher&lt;/a&gt;. They needed entries reviewed by loosely-affiliated domain experts; I believe this was first used for the &lt;em&gt;Encyclopedia of Monasticism&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/audreyberns/"&gt;Audrey Berns&lt;/a&gt; conceived of the idea, brought me in, and in retrospect acted as product manager, though that wasn’t a thing at the&amp;nbsp;time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The web application didn’t use JavaScript and just put a little link to a commenting form after every sentence in the text. Most of the work was about importing, login management, and workflow. The client was pretty happy with it, and I tepidly tried to turn this into a commercial application, but I didn’t really understand what I was&amp;nbsp;doing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span id="landscaper"&gt;2.&amp;nbsp;Landscaper&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was my favorite project from my time with the (still existing!) web consulting company &lt;a href="https://www.imagescape.com/"&gt;Imaginary Landscape&lt;/a&gt;. Landscaper was a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CMS&lt;/span&gt; that published to static files (&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_Side_Includes"&gt;Server Side Includes&lt;/a&gt;, but I would have liked to add &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PHP&lt;/span&gt;). This is an idea that wasn’t that uncommon at the time (remember &lt;a href="https://www.movabletype.org/"&gt;Movable Type&lt;/a&gt;?) but fell out of favor, and now is back in&amp;nbsp;favor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I co-developed this along with &lt;a href="https://pypi.org/project/Paste/"&gt;Paste&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.formencode.org/en/latest/modules/htmlfill.html"&gt;formencode.htmlfill&lt;/a&gt;. One of the features I was particularly proud of was the custom page types: a new page type was defined by writing (in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CMS&lt;/span&gt;) a template and an &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HTML&lt;/span&gt; form, and FormEncode could parse all the information from that. It wasn’t sophisticated, but it was so &lt;em&gt;simple&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much of the design and requirements was done by &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/lisa-king-5013933/"&gt;Lisa King&lt;/a&gt;. I distinctly remember one of our many design reviews where we had reached a point of disagreement: when we got to the end she effectively threw up her hands, &lt;em&gt;fine, you can have your way like always&lt;/em&gt;, which surprised me because I thought we had ended up someplace quite different than where we started. I thought we were participating in a generative process. But what I thought was a series of different proposals she had seen as me reiterating and reexplaining the same concept to exhaustion, and why wouldn&amp;#8217;t she? The compromises I made were all part of an internal dialog. A lesson I took from that was to be overtly explicit when I was incorporating or adopting someone else’s idea or adapting an idea to input. I &lt;em&gt;am&lt;/em&gt; stubborn, to a fault, but not nearly as stubborn as it&amp;nbsp;seemed!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CMS&lt;/span&gt; was proprietary, so I left it when I left the job. I don’t believe it is used any longer. Building a minimalist &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CMS&lt;/span&gt; is still on that list of things-I-probably-won’t-get-to (but still think&amp;nbsp;about).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span id="sqlobject"&gt;3.&amp;nbsp;SQLObject&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve lost track of why I even created &lt;a href="http://sqlobject.org/"&gt;SQLObject&lt;/a&gt;. I believe it was when I was involved with &lt;a href="https://webwareforpython.github.io/w4py/"&gt;Webware&lt;/a&gt;, a Python web framework from from an earlier&amp;nbsp;generation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like to think that it was early and perhaps influential in the use of metaprogramming in Python. It also represents some naivety on my part about database programming, embodying a style I was used to in MySQL/&lt;span class="caps"&gt;PHP&lt;/span&gt; projects, but I hadn’t encountered larger and more complicated&amp;nbsp;databases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a project SQLObject was hard for me: I felt weighed down by early design choices, and chronically guilty about support and maintenance. &lt;a href="https://phdru.name/"&gt;Oleg Broytman&lt;/a&gt; took over maintenance and has done an excellent job keeping it going over the&amp;nbsp;years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span id="formencode"&gt;4.&amp;nbsp;FormEncode&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In some ways &lt;a href="http://www.formencode.org"&gt;FormEncode&lt;/a&gt; represents an answer to a problem whose time has passed: how should we manage complicated &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HTML&lt;/span&gt; forms with validation and editing? Now this is mostly handled on the client side, and a “validation” framework only has to reject bad data, it doesn’t have to help the client repair that data (JavaScript can handle that&amp;nbsp;part).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FormEncode also looked at the problem as a general encoding/decoding problem, and a schema definition&amp;nbsp;problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Together with SQLObject these probably represent taking clever declarations too far. I now accept and appreciate imperative declaration for more cases. I don’t think I did a good job passing on maintainership, but &lt;a href="https://cito.github.io/"&gt;Christoph Zwerschke&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://whatschrisdoing.com/"&gt;Christopher Lambacher&lt;/a&gt; kept it going despite&amp;nbsp;that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span id="paste-wsgi"&gt;5. Paste and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;WSGI&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;everything&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was frequently forced to work with &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zope#Zope_2"&gt;Zope&lt;/a&gt; professionally. There are some interesting ideas in Zope, but mostly it was a very difficult environment to understand, control, and manipulate. Zope’s monolithic application server represents an approach that was common at the time, but would be unfamiliar to most web developers&amp;nbsp;today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.python.org/community/sigs/current/web-sig/"&gt;Web &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SIG&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; offered a kind of reprieve, and I became very enthusiastic about the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Server_Gateway_Interface"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;WSGI&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; concept that &lt;a href="https://dirtsimple.org/"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;PJE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; proposed (I think for him it may have come out of his work with &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chandler_(software)"&gt;Chandler&lt;/a&gt;?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;WSGI&lt;/span&gt; turned web programming into something more functional, keeping application servers and web handlers separate, and turning middleware into just function composition. Application server and handler are both critical components of an application, but have every ability to be separate: application servers dispatch concurrent work and manage reliability, and they really don’t need to know much about how the work gets done. Handlers contain all the domain logic. Middleware I’m not as sure&amp;nbsp;about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Along the way I built a toolkit called Paste meant to be a neutral reusable library for doing web things. I enjoyed the power of it all, building &lt;a href="https://www.ianbicking.org/my-first-ajax-app.html"&gt;interactive debuggers&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.ianbicking.org/blog/2010/04/webtest-http-testing.html"&gt;test frameworks, proxying&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://docs.pylonsproject.org/projects/pastedeploy/en/latest/"&gt;configuration and composition&lt;/a&gt; systems, a &lt;a href="https://pastescript.readthedocs.io/en/latest/"&gt;command-line script framework&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160719224005/http://pythonpaste.org/modules/exceptions.html"&gt;logging and monitoring&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those tools were used some, but the frameworks that made use of them have mostly disappeared in favor of web frameworks that are managed in a more monolithic fashion. (The frameworks might not be technically more monolithic, but I think it’s accurate to say that their &lt;em&gt;communities&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;are.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What remains of Paste is now in other projects, various people extracted the bits that were useful and reimplemented them in new packages. &lt;a href="https://pylonsproject.org/"&gt;Pylons&lt;/a&gt; got several, &lt;a href="https://repoze.readthedocs.io/en/latest/"&gt;Repoze&lt;/a&gt; some&amp;nbsp;others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To the degree this work had impact, it was mostly through other people: &lt;a href="https://be.groovie.org/"&gt;Ben Bangert&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/pjenvey"&gt;Philip Jenvey&lt;/a&gt; did a lot of early work, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/chrismcdonough"&gt;Chris McDonough&lt;/a&gt; did the extraction work to keep the pieces&amp;nbsp;alive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span id="webob"&gt;6.&amp;nbsp;WebOb&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WebOb was an effort to clean up things from Paste by creating one big &lt;span class="caps"&gt;WSGI&lt;/span&gt; request and response object, trying to be as thorough and high quality as possible. Paste could have looked like WebOb at any time, but it took me a while to acknowledge that being bland and neutral (to avoid competing with web frameworks) wasn’t very&amp;nbsp;useful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WebOb used &lt;span class="caps"&gt;WSGI&lt;/span&gt; as the basic model for requests and responses, but I found it was also a good test framework and client library. If it was timed earlier and my interest had been different I may have pushed for it to be a more “standard” set of objects for&amp;nbsp;Python.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WebOb still exists and is maintained inside Pylons. Sergey Schetinin did a very solid job maintaining it until it passed to &lt;a href="https://bertjwregeer.com/"&gt;Bert &lt;span class="caps"&gt;JW&lt;/span&gt; Regeer&lt;/a&gt; who continues to maintain&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span id="deliverance"&gt;7.&amp;nbsp;Deliverance&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As mentioned, Zope haunted me professionally. I had to deal with Zope, but I hated it, and wanted to find ways to support more heterogeneous&amp;nbsp;environments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/deliverance/Deliverance"&gt;Deliverance&lt;/a&gt; was a project started by some Zope people (I believe &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/paulweveritt"&gt;Paul Everitt&lt;/a&gt; specifically roped me into it). The idea was to separate styling and other aspects of “delivery” from the backend. He did it with a language that compiled into &lt;span class="caps"&gt;XSLT&lt;/span&gt;, with selectors that used XPath and I think it required &lt;span class="caps"&gt;XHTML&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goal was to be able to support sites that used Zope, other Python servers, WordPress, and whatever else may come along. But all the applications should be consistent and allow styling that would be applied across all of&amp;nbsp;them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I rewrote it as a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;WSGI&lt;/span&gt; server and used &lt;a href="https://lxml.de/"&gt;lxml&lt;/a&gt; for the rewriting. I wrote &lt;a href="https://lxml.de/cssselect.html"&gt;lxml.cssselect&lt;/a&gt; to support &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CSS&lt;/span&gt; instead of XPath, and extended &lt;a href="https://lxml.de/lxmlhtml.html"&gt;lxml.html&lt;/a&gt; to enable other interesting&amp;nbsp;tricks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;lxml is one of those libraries that I wish had become a standard for Python. The installation was annoying, but the functionality is great. Along with &lt;code&gt;formencode.htmlfill&lt;/code&gt; this is where I started to really enjoy using parsed &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HTML&lt;/span&gt; as a first-class data&amp;nbsp;representation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deliverance &lt;a href="https://github.com/deliverance/Deliverance"&gt;source exists&lt;/a&gt;, but hasn’t been updated for many&amp;nbsp;years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This happened around when &lt;a href="https://martinfowler.com/articles/microservices.html"&gt;microservices&lt;/a&gt; were becoming a thing. In a sense Deliverance represents a very different idea of microservices, where the services are actually presented directly to users, and the goal is reusable interactive web applications and components. We see some of this today where the assembly is done in the browser itself (via JavaScript), but it remains an ad hoc and informal approach. &lt;a href="https://sandstorm.io/"&gt;Sandstorm&lt;/a&gt; has some similar&amp;nbsp;motivations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span id="silverlining"&gt;8. Silver&amp;nbsp;Lining&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point I was struggling with sharing application setup and deployment – it was hard for me to maintain for my own stack, not to mention share with&amp;nbsp;teammates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I played around with &lt;a href="https://cloud.google.com/appengine"&gt;App Engine&lt;/a&gt; a bit, but it had so many constraints that I couldn’t advocate it or use it for my own work. Automatic server provisioning was a new thing, and &lt;a href="https://libcloud.apache.org/"&gt;libcloud&lt;/a&gt; had come on the&amp;nbsp;scene.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/ianb/silverlining"&gt;Silver Lining&lt;/a&gt; was meant to be a way to take fairly regular applications and develop them locally or deploy them to a remote server, with a consistent approach. The model was similar to &lt;a href="https://12factor.net/"&gt;Twelve-Factor&lt;/a&gt;, emphasizing environment variables. It supported multiple applications, using lots of generated Apache configuration to do the routing in production. It strongly encouraged vendors libraries and avoided remote&amp;nbsp;builds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; liked it. It made development feel good to me, got all the bad parts out of the way. I never seriously used Heroku, I imagine it feels the same? But no one else found it interesting, and it didn’t go&amp;nbsp;anywhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I played around with a web application specification I called &lt;a href="https://github.com/ianb/pywebapp/blob/master/docs/spec.txt"&gt;pywebapp&lt;/a&gt;, but I already had &lt;a href="https://www.ianbicking.org/blog/2014/02/saying-goodbye-to-python.html"&gt;one foot out the door&lt;/a&gt; of Python web&amp;nbsp;development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span id="pip-virtualenv"&gt;9. pip and&amp;nbsp;virtualenv&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Building and composing applications was a theme through these, and pip and virtualenv fit into the same&amp;nbsp;area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With both this and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;WSGI&lt;/span&gt; work, I was mostly making the work of Philip J. Eby (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;PJE&lt;/span&gt;) more accessible. He mapped out and largely implemented both projects, and I applied my own sense of aesthetics to them. &lt;a href="https://setuptools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/easy_install.html"&gt;easy_install&lt;/a&gt; implemented much of what pip actually did, but people &lt;em&gt;loved&lt;/em&gt; to complain about &lt;code&gt;easy_install&lt;/code&gt;. The situation was to the point where people were regularly rejecting &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; transitive dependencies because they rejected the idea of&amp;nbsp;installers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;pip changed easy_installs defaults, added a little metadata, and I’d like to think it added a bunch of attractive command line and logging&amp;nbsp;aesthetics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;virtualenv took a tiny script &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PJE&lt;/span&gt; had written and again made it more pleasant to&amp;nbsp;use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are by far my most popular works. I’ve stopped working on them long ago, but luckily other people have done great work both improving and advocating for them. I cannot even take credit for transitioning them. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/dstufft"&gt;Donald Stufft&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/carljm"&gt;Carl Meyer&lt;/a&gt; in particular got these projects through the lean winter months before they had a new spring. I am now &lt;a href="https://github.com/pypa/pip/graphs/contributors"&gt;number 14&lt;/a&gt; in the list of pip contributors, which I find quite&amp;nbsp;gratifying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The irony of these projects is that I was always trying to get &lt;em&gt;past&lt;/em&gt; the operational issues of installation and deployment. I don’t like building and installing and composition, but I wanted to invest some time so that my work was spent more on the things I really wanted to do, things that felt valuable to struggle with. And this is probably why they were successful: everyone else felt the same way, so at the time the space was both open and needed. But I will also take some credit for putting significant effort into promotion, which helped center the community around the tools, both in terms of contribution and documentation. It&amp;#8217;s unfortunate that the next set of functionality – environment management, dependency bundling, executable bundling, etc – hasn&amp;#8217;t been able to gel into an agreed-upon set of tools. Someone would be doing the community a favor to try to build consensus, even though manufactured consensus will require some uncomfortable&amp;nbsp;forcefulness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span id="doctestjs"&gt;10.&amp;nbsp;doctest.js&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This isn&amp;#8217;t a large project, just a path-not-taken; a failed attempt to exist in the JavaScript open source world as I had in&amp;nbsp;Python.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I really liked doctest in Python. My own personal feeling about tests is that they should support forward momentum, and good test failures are the most important part of a testing framework. A failure should tell you as much as possible about what to do next. And stubbed tests should be easy to turn into real&amp;nbsp;tests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/doctest.html"&gt;Doctest&lt;/a&gt; is great for all of this: you just write some &lt;span class="caps"&gt;REPL&lt;/span&gt;-like code, and your failures are all in the form of potentially-passing tests (just copy in the&amp;nbsp;output!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wanted to bring this to JavaScript, and did so in &lt;a href="https://github.com/ianb/doctestjs"&gt;doctest.js&lt;/a&gt; (with &lt;a href="http://www.ianbicking.org/blog/2012/10/why-doctestjs-is-better-than-pythons-doctest.html"&gt;improvements!&lt;/a&gt;). But no one ever cared.&amp;nbsp;Sigh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I never got the hang of the JavaScript open source world. I don’t feel like part of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;JS&lt;/span&gt; open source community, but I also don’t even know what it would feel like or where that community is. Clearly I show my&amp;nbsp;age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span id="togetherjs"&gt;11. TogetherJS &lt;span class="amp"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;Hotdish&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are the kinds of projects that I had always wanted to get to: projects that meaningfully change how we interact with&amp;nbsp;computers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://togetherjs.com/"&gt;TogetherJS&lt;/a&gt; is a drop-in library to add realtime collaborative features to any website, a category of tool known as &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cobrowsing"&gt;cobrowsing&lt;/a&gt;. It includes &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UI&lt;/span&gt; and infrastructure, a ton of complicated session management, and it at least tries to engage with the complicated user questions that arise with collaborative browsing. And people really liked&amp;nbsp;it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I made TogetherJS with &lt;a href="https://aarondruck.com/"&gt;Aaron Druck&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://github.com/simonwex"&gt;Simon Wex&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="https://www.mozillalabs.com/"&gt;Mozilla Labs&lt;/a&gt;. We knew the &lt;a href="https://www.ianbicking.org/blog/2014/09/professional-transitions.html"&gt;end was coming for Labs&lt;/a&gt;, and Aaron and &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/gregg-lind/"&gt;Gregg Lind&lt;/a&gt; and I tried to pivot to something more Firefox-centric with a project called &lt;a href="https://www.ianbicking.org/projects.html#hotdish"&gt;Hotdish&lt;/a&gt;. Hotdish was based on a collaborative browser window, where anything you did in that window was shared with your little group, including screensharing, ambient awareness, and cursor sharing, as we tried to think about how people could work virtually next to each other. Especially since on computers you aren’t really “next” to each other even when you are in the same room, and we wanted to change&amp;nbsp;that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But no one in Mozilla cared. Aaron was laid off when Labs closed, and I probably would have been as well if my manager hadn’t given me some cover. We’d just had a second child, my confidence was low, and I didn’t want to make big changes, so I licked my wounds and moved&amp;nbsp;on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This one really hurt. I really believed in what we were doing, in how we were doing it, even in the potential alignment with Mozilla. It was the work I &lt;em&gt;wanted&lt;/em&gt; to be doing all along. And it felt like it amounted to&amp;nbsp;nothing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I withdrew completely from TogetherJS. I felt unable to maintain a healthy relationship with it while also keeping my head above the water on other matters. Unfortunately I didn’t make it easy for other people to keep it alive, though it refused to quite die and &lt;a href="https://github.com/jsfiddle/togetherjs"&gt;still exists today&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best summary of my thoughts inspired by TogetherJS and Hotdish is in &lt;a href="https://www.ianbicking.org/blog/2014/03/towards-next-level-of-collaboration.html"&gt;Towards a Next Level of Collaboration&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span id="screenshots"&gt;12. PageShot and Firefox&amp;nbsp;Screenshots&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started PageShot based on a hint of strategic direction from the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CEO&lt;/span&gt; of Mozilla, and then went long with it. &lt;a href="http://donovanpreston.com/"&gt;Donovan Preston&lt;/a&gt; was able to work on it for quite a while, until we got further on and he was feeling ready to swap out and I was ready to swap&amp;nbsp;in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goal was to provide full-page frozen &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DOM&lt;/span&gt; renderings as a shareable resource on the web. This is a little like &lt;a href="https://archive.is/"&gt;archive.is&lt;/a&gt;, except that it’s your personal view of a site, not the public view. There are also several projects that do this locally, like &lt;a href="https://blog.webmemex.org/"&gt;WebMemex&lt;/a&gt;. I really wanted to do it as something shareable, a frankly aggressive move to give people personal autonomy over the things they see. It also could be a hub for &lt;a href="https://www.ianbicking.org/blog/2015/05/product-journal-as-we-may-discuss.html"&gt;annotation&lt;/a&gt;, data extraction, scraping, history tracking… all sorts of&amp;nbsp;things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But of course there were serious security and copyright concerns. So, when the time came to actually ship it, we dropped all the cool &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DOM&lt;/span&gt; freezing stuff and just kept the pixel screenshotting, removing even the most basic metadata we had been capturing. It was hard to let it go. We told ourselves we’d try to bring it back, but we all&amp;nbsp;knew…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then the project shipped in Firefox, and it was a quiet but very popular service. It didn’t do anything unique, but I think we created a very nice interface (with considerable effort from &lt;a href="https://bram.me/"&gt;Bram Pitoyo’s&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://johngruenprojects.com/"&gt;John Gruen’s&lt;/a&gt; design work). In general it was an exercise in reducing expectations and actually being satisfied with the result. Millions of people used it, people frequently mentioned it when talking about why they liked Firefox, and we saw real retention improvements among its users. It took a big hit with the &lt;a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2017/11/14/introducing-firefox-quantum/"&gt;Quantum redesign&lt;/a&gt;, which relegated it to what I have come to call the “meatball menu” (the hamburger menu’s cousin, a line of three meatballs: ⋯). But people still found and enjoyed it (small lesson: many people love the context&amp;nbsp;menu?!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then sharing and the server were cancelled and the project largely pushed aside because… I don’t know? We never fit into any strategy, and we were all tired. I was tired too so I didn’t fight it. It was a modest feature, it didn’t feel like “the future”. And it wasn’t, it was a rehashing of very old and well-understood things. I myself had to put in quite a bit of effort to accept that there is value in doing old and well-understood things when that’s what the people&amp;nbsp;want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Screenshots remains a feature in&amp;nbsp;Firefox.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span id="browserlab"&gt;13. Browser&amp;nbsp;Lab&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a project that never launched, but I sure did fiddle with it for a long&amp;nbsp;time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://medium.com/firefox-context-graph/context-graph-its-time-to-bring-context-back-to-the-web-a7542fe45cf3"&gt;Context Graph&lt;/a&gt; was a Firefox initiative: &lt;em&gt;a forward button for the web&lt;/em&gt;. Or: another way to get to what’s next, not links promoted by Facebook’s algorithm or scrolling ever further down some infinite scroll timeline or reflexively opening the same sites over and over. What if your browser could offer something smart for &lt;em&gt;where next&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was never directly involved with Context Graph, but why not see what there is to learn? PageShot was still capturing full pages at this stage, and I extract a list of all the URLs I had visited for the last two years and started to &lt;a href="https://www.ianbicking.org/blog/2016/08/product-journal-oops-a-scraper.html"&gt;drive it through PageShot&lt;/a&gt;. I did it in a window in the background while I was working, and it was surprisingly weird feeling to see all these old news articles pop up, old emails (Gmail URLs are very stable!), and every other little bit of web activity I had built&amp;nbsp;up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It felt like there was gold in there, though retroactively getting pages didn’t give me nearly as much data as I would like. So I made what I first called the Personal History Archive, and then I half-renamed &lt;a href="https://github.com/ianb/personal-history-archive/"&gt;Browser Lab&lt;/a&gt;. After installing the program and extension it will extract as much browsing data as possible, serializing it into a local SQLite database and static files, including frozen copies of&amp;nbsp;pages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The result is entirely impossible to share. It’s not like sharing URLs, which might be embarrassing, but are easy enough to scrub. For instance if you open Gmail then all the subject lines are serialized. So my goal was either self-experimentation, constructing a personal shareable set (e.g., do all my GitHub and open professional activity on it, but avoid most other normal activity), or get Mozilla to hire some temps to spend the day idly browsing with the understanding that we were recording&amp;nbsp;them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It never got that far, but I did enjoy messing around with it, and I still believe there’s gold in there. I made an accompanying Python library to handle the data, and made it usable in Jupyter. I think the idea of datasets paired with libraries is something we should do more of. I played around with &lt;a href="https://github.com/ianb/personal-history-archive/blob/master/python/nn_readable.ipynb"&gt;training a neural net to detect article bodies&lt;/a&gt; and realized &lt;a href="https://github.com/ianb/personal-history-archive/blob/master/python/named_entities.ipynb"&gt;named-entity extraction is very greedy&lt;/a&gt;. But I never got very deep into the analysis I was trying to&amp;nbsp;enable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s really no reason for me to ever revisit this, even though I found it a genuinely fun and interesting project. If there was something to be learned there it was for Mozilla to learn and act upon. And Mozilla still could! I never knew how to get people’s&amp;nbsp;attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span id="firefox-voice"&gt;14. Firefox&amp;nbsp;Voice&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not the end of the list, just the end for now, because Firefox Voice brings us up to today. (I vow to start, maybe finish, and move past many entirely new&amp;nbsp;projects!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/mozilla-extensions/firefox-voice"&gt;Firefox Voice&lt;/a&gt; was started shortly before I joined the Consumer Voice Products team, by &lt;a href="https://juliacambre.com/"&gt;Julia Cambre&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/andrenatalbr"&gt;André Natal&lt;/a&gt;. It was the second attempt at the idea by the team (with &lt;a href="https://abewallin.com/"&gt;Abe Wallin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.harraton.com/"&gt;Janice Tsai&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://jofish.com/"&gt;Jofish Kaye&lt;/a&gt;). The concept was straight-forward: build a voice assistant for the browser. I’ve been working on the project for the last&amp;nbsp;year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This deserves a whole post, so I won’t do a retrospective here (&lt;a href="https://www.ianbicking.org/blog/2020/08/thoughts-on-voice-interfaces.html"&gt;Thoughts on Voice Interfaces&lt;/a&gt; offers some of my general observations). I did believe in the project. As a voice assistant for desktop Firefox it wasn’t enough. But as a toehold to create a natural language interface to the web, it could have been a lot. Everything you want to interact with in your computing life is accessible one way or another through the web, and building new ways to get at that feels useful and important. And maybe it still could be, we’ll see&amp;#8230; but it won’t happen at&amp;nbsp;Mozilla.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even before the project (and team and division) was &lt;a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2020/08/11/changing-world-changing-mozilla/"&gt;cancelled&lt;/a&gt;, I realized Mozilla wasn’t ready to invest enough to succeed. I don’t think success requires an &lt;a href="https://voicebot.ai/2018/11/15/amazon-alexa-headcount-surpasses-10000-employees-here-is-the-growth-rate/"&gt;Alexa-sized project&lt;/a&gt;, but it’s bigger than a team of four and a handful of interns, as much as I enjoyed working with them&amp;nbsp;all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span id="what-next"&gt;What&amp;nbsp;next?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I seldom think about most of the old projects now. They have long ago been &lt;a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/page_out"&gt;paged out&lt;/a&gt; of my mind to make room for new things. It feels a little unfair to my past self, enthusiastic and full of hope around some new idea. I haven’t even lost faith in many of those ideas, but I am no longer the one suited to pursue&amp;nbsp;them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve had to put aside guilt to move on, but I haven’t figured out how to balance that with the work to let a project live up to its potential. I respect those who have done the work to maintain open source projects over a long period of time, and I&amp;#8217;ve accepted I&amp;#8217;m not that kind of&amp;nbsp;person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lesson I’m taking from this exercise of listing projects is that I have not paid enough attention over the years to the people I’ve worked with. Software can’t survive long on its own, and its intrinsic value is as limited as its longevity. Professional relationships are also impermanent. But… there’s potential I’ve missed out&amp;nbsp;on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, I’m hardly the only one who moves on: people, companies, industries, entire societies move on from problems. They just decide something doesn’t matter, or doesn’t matter &lt;em&gt;enough&lt;/em&gt;. Often I’ve felt like the last one at the party, not able to call it quits. Who am I to blow against the&amp;nbsp;wind?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I still feel like a beginner in the area of voice, but I have developed some opinions. Many observations are the influence of other people’s ideas, work, or research, but I’ve lost the provenance. I’ve benefited a great deal from the long and regular discussions I’ve had with my team, particularly &lt;a href="http://abewallin.com"&gt;Abraham Wallin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.harraton.com/"&gt;Janice Tsai&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://jofish.com"&gt;Jofish Kaye&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://juliacambre.com"&gt;Julia Cambre&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="https://voicebot.ai/2020/09/07/ian-bicking-talks-firefox-voice-and-observations-about-assistants-today-voicebot-podcast-ep-166/"&gt;Hear me talk about some of these topics on this Voicebot podcast&amp;nbsp;episode&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Voice interfaces are voice &lt;em&gt;interfaces&lt;/em&gt;. They are a way for the user to express their desire, using patterns that might be &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skeuomorph"&gt;skeuomorphism&lt;/a&gt; of regular voice interactions, or might be specific learned behaviors. It&amp;#8217;s not a conversation. You aren&amp;#8217;t talking with the computer.&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I suspect you can push the user into a conversational skeuomorphism if you think that&amp;#8217;s best, and the user will play along, but it&amp;#8217;s no more right than another metaphor. It&amp;#8217;s a question of quality of interaction, not ease or&amp;nbsp;familiarity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;That said, speaking is an improvisation. You have something you want to say, you&amp;#8217;ve probably prepared a few keywords, but the rest you make up word-by-word. Words won’t come out your mouth with grammatical&amp;nbsp;precision.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I hate how voice interfaces force us to speak without pauses because a pause is treated as the end of the statement. Firefox Voice does the same thing, so I appreciate why it works this way. I still hate it.&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Typically tools operate on the granularity of an &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utterance"&gt;utterance&lt;/a&gt;: one statement, command, query. It&amp;#8217;s the same for conversational interfaces, just a different kind of&amp;nbsp;turn-taking.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Many systems use a &amp;#8220;wakeword&amp;#8221; or &amp;#8220;keyword spotting&amp;#8221; to start the interaction. What if we used keyword spotting to determine the end as well? &amp;#8220;Please&amp;#8221; might be a good choice. It&amp;#8217;s like the Enter&amp;nbsp;key.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I read a science fiction story where they used voice interfaces, and used &amp;#8220;please&amp;#8221; as a statement terminator as well (in a &lt;a href="https://archive.org/details/Asimovs_v15n12n13_1991-11/page/n227/mode/2up"&gt;story by Phillip C. Jennings&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://archive.org/stream/Asimovs_v15n12n13_1991-11/Asimovs_v15n12n13_1991-11_djvu.txt"&gt;[text only]&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a id="footnote1-source" href="#footnote1"&gt;**&lt;/a&gt;). This also made &amp;#8220;please&amp;#8221; insulting, using it meant you regarded someone as no more important than a&amp;nbsp;computer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Another option might be speculative execution while allowing amendments. A common example would be when you want to say &amp;#8220;set reminder for 2pm to go to the post office&amp;#8221; but you paused just a little too long and the assistant jumped on you at &amp;#8220;set reminder for 2pm&amp;#8221;. Now it&amp;#8217;s going to blather on about a question (“what reminder?”), and not only do you have to wait, you have to time your response. It would be nice if the moment you said &amp;#8220;set reminder for 2pm&amp;#8221; the assistant would indicate (visually) &amp;#8220;setting 2pm reminder for what?&amp;#8221; and you might answer anytime, and if you were slow it might give an audio prompt which you could also talk&amp;nbsp;over.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some people think it is important that we &lt;a href="https://www.the-vital-edge.com/digital-assistants-abuse/"&gt;not abuse assistants&lt;/a&gt;. They believe abuse will make us cold or abusive to each other. I do not agree.&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We&amp;#8217;ve also learned that people feel embarrassed when they can&amp;#8217;t get their assistant to understand them. It&amp;#8217;s different than other interfaces, as the voice makes it feel more personal and judgy. So concern over emotional impact is not&amp;nbsp;misplaced.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When I used a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GPS&lt;/span&gt; in the car regularly it would continually give voice instructions. I&amp;#8217;d miss a turn and it would constantly tell me to make a U-turn or otherwise backtrack. I&amp;#8217;d also just &lt;em&gt;choose&lt;/em&gt; another route and it would complain. I knew I didn’t make a mistake, but I still felt judged. Then I turned off the voice and it was fine, the screen just informed me, it didn&amp;#8217;t judge&amp;nbsp;me.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Which is to say: I don’t think the answer is compassion towards our computers. They neither need it nor even ask for it. Instead of navigating through the uncanny valley we should keep computer and human separate. You want to cut short what your assistant is saying? Please do. Our challenge as implementers is to keep your heart from going cold by making it very clear this isn&amp;#8217;t a human and has no&amp;nbsp;feelings.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An aside, but &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVlhMGQgDkY"&gt;this classic video&lt;/a&gt; of people taunting a Boston Robotics robot made people uncomfortable (including me!). They are being such jerks! I think the answer is that we should not make robots that look like humans. You and I pass on the sidewalk, and we have to navigate cooperatively to keep from hitting each other. If I bust through you paying no attention that makes me the asshole. I don&amp;#8217;t want to have to start navigating politeness with robots too: they should step aside; if I place a hand on a robot it should stop, not be offended. I&amp;#8217;m not polite to doors either, and this does not make me a worse&amp;nbsp;person.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Voice is not a command-line interface. Voice ends up as text, and despite caveats&amp;#8230; really it’s just treated as text. So it seems appealing to treat it like a command line interface, but no&amp;#8230;&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Accuracy is a big issue. Transcription errors are common. You can recover from a lot, but I think it puts a real upper limit on how much information you can give the computer before interaction is required. Maybe you are 95% successful saying one thing. But then you only have 90% chance of saying two concepts together. If the concept is complicated then 95% accuracy is&amp;nbsp;generous.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you execute something complicated using several smaller commands then you have opportunities to fix problems part way through. You&amp;#8217;ll need those opportunities. We call this&amp;nbsp;“repair”.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I think &amp;#8220;undo&amp;#8221; would be a nice capability to build into everything. It would probably be a prefix to your reparative command. Like, &amp;#8220;no, search for nearby tacos&amp;#8221; meaning undo last command and then do this new&amp;nbsp;one.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Besides accuracy, it&amp;#8217;s also mentally harder to successfully compose complex or precise sentences when speaking. Tools can ignore uninteresting words, accept multiple phrasings, put in reasonable defaults, but we can only do that once you’ve spoken. We can&amp;#8217;t boost your brain to make it easier to speak complex&amp;nbsp;phrases.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GUIs are a little like a discussion. You get a menu of options – buttons and controls – and micro-feedback like hover states or a depressed state, as well as macro-feedback like actual changes in the screen to indicate what happened. Trying to compose a compound voice statement can be trying to interact with a laggy &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UI&lt;/span&gt; where you outrun the screen refresh. It&amp;#8217;s frustrating by&amp;nbsp;default.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It&amp;#8217;s not necessarily easy to give humans compound commands either. Try accomplishing something by looking over someone&amp;#8217;s shoulder and telling them what to&amp;nbsp;click&amp;#8230;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Familiarity makes it possible to talk through a task with both computers and humans. I&amp;#8217;ve definitely become familiar with my Alexa, I&amp;#8217;ve learned what phrases work and which&amp;nbsp;don&amp;#8217;t.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Short phrases are much harder for the computer to properly transcribe. Brevity is punished. The more words you use to express less information, the better it works. “Paste” is almost never detected&amp;nbsp;correctly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Assuming you don&amp;#8217;t have a custom transcription language model for your application, it will be very hard to get the computer to hear what you are saying if you are required to use odd phrases or terms. It&amp;#8217;s like having a stenographer that just doesn&amp;#8217;t know anything about your&amp;nbsp;domain.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I do wonder if there’s something like &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procedure_word"&gt;procedure words&lt;/a&gt; for voice interfaces. You’ll know these from words like “roger” and “mayday”, where there’s clear and unambiguous words to communicate vital&amp;nbsp;information.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Voice has constraints, but it also has advantages, mostly from using language.&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The biggest is that you can talk about things you can&amp;#8217;t see. A &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GUI&lt;/span&gt; has to show everything you can act on (sometimes with doorways to other&amp;nbsp;things)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can&amp;#8217;t see search queries. And so search is always a top use of voice! In general search is used for things you can’t see but want to&amp;nbsp;find.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Things-you-can&amp;#8217;t-see is also important in multitasking. You can&amp;#8217;t see the content of other tabs, and often can&amp;#8217;t see other applications. I don&amp;#8217;t think we&amp;#8217;ve figured out how to unleash this, but I think there&amp;#8217;s something&amp;nbsp;there.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Because of the imprecision of voice everything is a search even if you wish it wasn&amp;#8217;t. So something as simple as adding a bookmark to a folder involves searching for the&amp;nbsp;folder.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You also can&amp;#8217;t see things that don&amp;#8217;t exist yet. I can imagine some utility in using language to create conditionals and triggers, using language’s ability to talk about something that does not yet exist. What excites me here isn’t that voice is necessarily easier, but that it’s easy to take phrases that do something now and rephrase them to talk about the future. Learning to talk about the future is implicit when learning to act right&amp;nbsp;now.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For all the cool things one might imagine doing with natural language interfaces, right now it&amp;#8217;s all imperative commands.&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This is in part a human’s relationship with the computer. You don&amp;#8217;t care what the computer thinks, you don&amp;#8217;t need to theorize on what will happen or give it reassurance, you just tell it what to&amp;nbsp;do.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Conveniently English imperatives are simpler than most other sentences. This is probably no coincidence, as an imperative is designed to be understood and acted on&amp;nbsp;unambiguously.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;But there may be something useful about using voice to create descriptions in parallel with other activities. For instance some researchers have found a benefit in having the user describe their actions while a recorder sees the concrete (but noisy) clicks and&amp;nbsp;movements.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maybe tagging and organization are useful voice tasks, to be done in parallel with other non-voice navigation. Voice could be a layer on top of normal&amp;nbsp;interfaces.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Access to microphones is hard and a big deal.&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There&amp;#8217;s lots of very reasonable privacy&amp;nbsp;concerns.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Like many privacy concerns, they are solved by making things harder for&amp;nbsp;everyone.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Analog hardware is just difficult to handle, different hardware performs differently, things cut out or fail over&amp;nbsp;time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Custom hardware, like in the Alexa, makes really useful&amp;nbsp;improvements.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The big-bag-of-intent-handlers approach to parsing causes some problems&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As far as I can tell every system uses some form of categorization/classification, mapping a phrase to a handler. There’s always overlap, so you have to decide which handler is&amp;nbsp;best.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Given variable inputs (search query, artist name, etc), mistranscriptions, and stopwords, the complete space of inputs is hard to&amp;nbsp;enumerate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As a result adding new handlers can have unexpected results, throwing the balance of the system off. I’ve been unimpressed with the extensibility of most assistants, but it’s&amp;nbsp;understandable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can imagine always preferring native handlers to extension handlers, but that’s not great either. You want the handlers to be fairly broad, and it’s likely new handlers will be a refinement on functionality that’s merely a best-effort fallback for the default&amp;nbsp;handlers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Apparently the vanguard of technology are now marketing agencies.&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Growth in these areas seems to be driven by someone saying &amp;#8220;you know, voice is the&amp;nbsp;future&amp;#8230;&amp;#8221;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The marketplaces for voice assistant skills are pretty awful for both consumers and producers. Consumers find junk, producers can&amp;#8217;t find an&amp;nbsp;audience.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Media outlets are the exception, but only because they are providing content instead of an&amp;nbsp;interface.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Everything people do with an assistant seems stable and frozen. People do factual searches, weather, timers, reminders, and turn on and off&amp;nbsp;lights.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The amount of technology we&amp;#8217;re bringing to bear on a replacement for The Clapper is&amp;nbsp;impressive.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Voice assistants, home and otherwise, are successful, but they are not successful&amp;nbsp;ecosystems.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It&amp;#8217;s neat that people tell you exactly what they want to do.&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you try to understand a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GUI&lt;/span&gt; from behavioral telemetry you have to figure out why maybe someone hit a button and then canceled and tried a different button, and that maybe implies they wanted to do something that isn&amp;#8217;t directly exposed, or maybe they just misclicked,&amp;nbsp;or&amp;#8230;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Because voice discovery is itself exploratory (if you want to find out if something works you should just try it), people will say what they&amp;nbsp;want.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Of course there&amp;#8217;s nothing that demands that an intent be clear enough to &lt;em&gt;ever&lt;/em&gt; be implementable. So you may just be exposed to desires you can never&amp;nbsp;fulfill.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Voice doesn&amp;#8217;t mean we can create smart agents that take care of everything.&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Voice makes smart agents seductive because you can express a desire using natural language without specifying exactly how to accomplish the&amp;nbsp;thing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You want a voice agent to buy tickets or order you dinner? No, you don&amp;#8217;t want this. This isn&amp;#8217;t going to be any more successful than asking a waiter to order for you. Maybe if you are adventurous or very familiar with the waiter it’s possible. Even in our family we&amp;#8217;re constantly asking each other questions about preference, and negotiating options for small questions, and we are &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; familiar with each&amp;nbsp;other.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Being able to state intentions instead of specific actions offers some opportunity to support greater focus and directed action.&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The way you do something with a normal &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GUI&lt;/span&gt; is you come up with the goal in your mind, decompose it into actions, and then start on the first action. Maybe open a tab, click on a button, find a document, etc. It’s easy to get lost along the way – not just confused, but also&amp;nbsp;distracted.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I doubt we can – or even should – just “make it happen” when there’s a complex goal-oriented statement. But even if the tool can’t easily break down a task, maybe the user can construct their own top-down outline of a&amp;nbsp;task.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This immediately leads to the idea you could then save the outline as a repeatable task. Instead of making it an opaque repeatable task, I suspect it would be better to make it a list, and make it easy to follow along with lists. Then the assistant says “next you did: ‘open most recent email from Joe’; say “ok” or a command…” and then maybe that’s the right next task, or maybe you say something else inspired by your past command. The assistant can provide task scaffolding instead of&amp;nbsp;automation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I am skeptical about learning and adaptation.&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reliability – even reliably making mistakes – is an important feature. It means the user can learn about the system and adapt their behavior, without the system foiling them by changing its own&amp;nbsp;behavior.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Discovery is hard, and having the search space change under your feet only makes it&amp;nbsp;worse.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In summary: humans learn faster and better than machines. If the experience is going to grow, it needs to be explicit and deterministic, not clever or&amp;nbsp;implied.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Voice output suffers from too much or not enough information.&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This is where impolite interruptions might make voice output&amp;nbsp;feasible.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Human voice interactions can have the same problem. We improve our communication by being in dialog with someone instead of just talking at them, and by using body language to interpret the interest of the other&amp;nbsp;person.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some of the equivalents – asking for confirmation before speaking more, or allowing the person to interrupt – might suffer from taking too many cues from human interaction. The questions themselves easily take more time and effort than just presenting too much information, and the interruptions turn the interaction into something that feels hostile instead of&amp;nbsp;helpful.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There’s “intent parsing” but not much I would consider “understanding”. There’s not much U in &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural-language_understanding"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NLU&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Intent parsing means: given an utterance, pick the most likely thing your program can do; and also: pull out some variable parameters from the&amp;nbsp;utterance&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There’s no room for understanding there. “Picking an intent handler” isn’t&amp;nbsp;understanding.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can only have understanding if you also have a knowledge model. Some flat &lt;span class="caps"&gt;JSON&lt;/span&gt; with some labels isn’t a model. Models in turn need to be attached to functional results: stuff the assistant can actually&amp;nbsp;do.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I don’t know what understanding looks like, or what those models will look like. And I’m not even sure I’ll recognize them when I see them, it’s possible even in the code they’ll be&amp;nbsp;implied.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As an aside, I personally believe action and meaning and understanding all go together: meaning only exists when we can attach it to effects, and abstract understanding is backfilled. So models without handlers aren’t meaningful, and models that are only handler references aren’t&amp;nbsp;models.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We could use more orthogonality. That is: meaningful phrase modifiers and statements that can apply across a wide variety of actions or application functionality.&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Orthogonality allows a user to come up with creative and unpredicted combinations in a phrase, and for those to actually&amp;nbsp;work.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The simplest form of this I’ve thought about is a simple verb/direct-object with a simple set of&amp;nbsp;modifiers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Another way to think about it might be akin to &lt;a href="https://www.ianbicking.org/blog/2018/02/web-small-composable-tools.html"&gt;composability&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Discovery is naturally hard.&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Natural language commands don’t need to be organized into hierarchical structures of menus or screens, which is nice but doesn’t lend itself to&amp;nbsp;navigation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Periodically showing the user some examples seems to be the state of the art.&amp;nbsp;Sad.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I feel like something might be possible with cuing. I am reminded of a small anecdote from Logo, where when you type something that isn’t defined (e.g., &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SQUARE&lt;/span&gt;) it will reply &lt;code&gt;I don’t know how&amp;nbsp; TO SQUARE&lt;/code&gt;, hinting in the error message what you should do next (&lt;code&gt;TO PROC&lt;/code&gt; defines a procedure). Doing this requires a cleverness in the language design that has not revealed itself to&amp;nbsp;me.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Besides errors, any output (speech or text) is an opportunity to use language that suggests what phrases can be used. It’s a chance to encourage the user to mirror the computer’s&amp;nbsp;language.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The big bag of intent handlers approach means there’s no natural comprehensibility to the space of phrases and abilities. By pursuing “natural language” we create a very sparse space of successful phrases amid the entirety of possible language. Is it&amp;nbsp;predictable?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Intents tend to be dominated by verbs, but I think we might do better leading with nouns.&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The parsers tend to focus on the constant bits, the verbs: “&lt;strong&gt;play&lt;/strong&gt; [artist]”, “&lt;strong&gt;send message to&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;[recipient]”.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This maps to a call like &lt;code&gt;sendMessage(“Emily”, “On my way home”)&lt;/code&gt;. But maybe it should map to something like &lt;code&gt;search(“Emily”).sendMessage(“On my way home”)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The point being that you want the intersection of “entities called &lt;em&gt;Emily&lt;/em&gt;” and &amp;#8220;entities that respond to &lt;em&gt;sendMessage&lt;/em&gt;”.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;STT&lt;/span&gt; (speech to text) and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TTS&lt;/span&gt; (text to speech) are terrible terms.&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I have to &lt;em&gt;think hard&lt;/em&gt; to get the right one. Every&amp;nbsp;time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I prefer “speech/voice transcription” and “speech/voice&amp;nbsp;generation”.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Twenty seems like a good round number for a conclusion.&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It feels like there’s two paths before us: structured and unstructured understanding. Both ultimately lead to structured understanding, humans construct syntactic and meaningful structured statements. Is the bridge to that a structured pidgin, or an unstructured statistical&amp;nbsp;understanding?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fundamental user interface standards in voice are still mysteries to us. Will a radical change and consolidation happen like with &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WIMP_(computing)"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;WIMP&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A whole new level of expressivity &lt;em&gt;might&lt;/em&gt; be revealed by voice interfaces. But I don’t think we know what that kind of relationship with a computer should look like. Current voice UIs are imperative just like graphical interfaces are&amp;nbsp;imperative.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The details all matter: failures in speech recognition, different listening modes, microphone access and quality, output length and intonation, and all that ignores the actual &lt;em&gt;functionality&lt;/em&gt; of the thing you are interfacing with, which also will require&amp;nbsp;changes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This clearly is going to happen, but I’m not at all certain the next shift will be centered on voice, or centered on something else and happen to include voice. As an analogy, touch interfaces enabled important changes… but touch interfaces themselves aren’t&amp;nbsp;important.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

Instead different groups use different axes, or different dichotomies, to look at the world. &lt;em&gt;Because&lt;/em&gt; we don&amp;#8217;t share a common idea of good vs. bad, thus we cannot agree on what is good and bad, and so we disagree&amp;nbsp;politically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The free &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PDF&lt;/span&gt; of the book is linked above if you want to read his exposition. I first encountered it in a &lt;a href="http://www.econtalk.org/kling-on-the-three-languages-of-politics/"&gt;podcast&lt;/a&gt;. The idea is&amp;nbsp;simple:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Liberals&lt;/strong&gt; view political conflict as &lt;strong&gt;oppressed vs.&amp;nbsp;oppressor&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conservatives&lt;/strong&gt; view political conflict as &lt;strong&gt;civilization vs.&amp;nbsp;barbarism&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Libertarians&lt;/strong&gt; view political conflict as &lt;strong&gt;freedom vs.&amp;nbsp;coercion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;None of this is meant to speak to the virtue or correctness of these political philosophies. Nor does political discourse directly reveal these beliefs. That&amp;#8217;s why it&amp;#8217;s so confusing: everyone is talking to the audience, slipping into different imagined value systems in the almost-useless attempt to &amp;#8220;convince&amp;#8221; someone of something. But underneath a conservative&amp;#8217;s argument is an argument &amp;#8220;you should do this in support of civilization and against barbarism&amp;#8221;, while a liberal makes another argument &amp;#8220;we must support these oppressed people in opposition to these oppressors&amp;#8221; – applied to a specific political conflict the arguments bear no resemblance to each other and are entirely unconvincing to the other&amp;nbsp;group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking at political views using these underlying value systems has helped me make more sense of the world. Instead of being shocked at the hypocrisy of other people&amp;#8217;s beliefs, it gives me a chance to feel some sense of empathy. It&amp;#8217;s not always a forgiving lens: for instance, looking at modern conservatism as an expressions of a battle between civilization and barbarism makes it all seem even more racist. But at least things make sense, and the wildly different reactions different groups have to the same event or idea makes more&amp;nbsp;sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(I don&amp;#8217;t believe in this libertarian axis. It&amp;#8217;s too close to the outward expression of libertarianism. If it was correct I think it would explain why anarchists and libertarians – outwardly sharing a value system of freedom vs. coercion – express their politics so&amp;nbsp;differently.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As helpful as these axes are, I looked at them and didn&amp;#8217;t see myself. I often self-identify as liberal, but I know in my heart I am not. The axis of &lt;em&gt;oppressed vs. oppressor&lt;/em&gt; makes that clearer to me: this is not my primary narrative lens, it&amp;#8217;s not how I construct stories for myself when deciding how I feel about&amp;nbsp;something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My first reaction, maybe because my primary narrative is one of hubris, is that &lt;strong&gt;I&lt;/strong&gt; am a &lt;strong&gt;realist&lt;/strong&gt;. I&amp;#8217;m above it all! Everyone else is stuck in their personal narratives, I just try to see things how they&amp;nbsp;are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is nonsense of course. Even my younger self was suspicious of self-proclaimed &amp;#8220;realists&amp;#8221;, but an older me is confident it is self-indulgent bullshit, a way of projecting biases and perspectives onto an imagined truth without bothering to investigate what truth really is. The only realist is someone who knows the limits of their narrow perspective too well to call themselves a&amp;nbsp;realist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still there&amp;#8217;s nothing inherent in these three political groups and three axes. So I offer this additional&amp;nbsp;axis:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Technocrats&lt;/strong&gt; view political conflict as &lt;strong&gt;progress vs.&amp;nbsp;superstition&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I thought about &amp;#8220;progress vs. regression&amp;#8221;, but that seems too easy. They are logical opposites, sure, but they don&amp;#8217;t express what draws me emotionally to one side and repels me from the other. Other options might be &amp;#8220;progress vs. corruption&amp;#8221; or &amp;#8220;progress vs. romanticism.&amp;#8221; It&amp;#8217;s important to capture &lt;strong&gt;how change feels to people in the group&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m not even sure if these are &amp;#8220;value systems&amp;#8221; so much as &lt;strong&gt;descriptions of what winning and losing feels like&lt;/strong&gt;. We imagine politics is (or should be) the making of rational arguments about different policies. Instead I think we tell each other stories about how we might win or lose. I don&amp;#8217;t know the implications, but right now everyone feels like they are losing.&amp;nbsp;Everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding how I frame winning and losing helps me be more at peace with the disagreements I have with other people, especially the people with whom I am close. I don&amp;#8217;t want to condemn them those people, I don&amp;#8217;t want to declare them as &amp;#8220;wrong&amp;#8221; (even only in my head). Agreeing to disagree by &lt;em&gt;understanding why we disagree&lt;/em&gt; feels&amp;nbsp;right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I could continue with this post and argue why my axis is the correct axis. But I truly do not believe that it is. We&amp;#8217;re better off with many value systems: there are many things I don&amp;#8217;t care about, but that someone should care about. It&amp;#8217;s not just balance, it&amp;#8217;s like an ecology of individuals making up a moral society. (And yet, not every ecology is&amp;nbsp;healthy&amp;#8230;)&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="misc"></category></entry><entry><title>“Users want control” is a shoulder shrug</title><link href="https://ianbicking.org/blog/2019/04/users-want-control-is-a-shrug.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2019-04-23T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2019-04-23T00:00:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Ian Bicking</name></author><id>tag:ianbicking.org,2019-04-23:/blog/2019/04/users-want-control-is-a-shrug.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Making the claim &amp;#8220;users want control&amp;#8221; is the same as saying you don&amp;#8217;t know what users want, you don&amp;#8217;t know what is good, and you don&amp;#8217;t know what their goals&amp;nbsp;are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I first started thinking about this during the debate over what would become the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient_Protection_and_Affordable_Care_Act"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;ACA&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p&gt;I first started thinking about this during the debate over what would become the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient_Protection_and_Affordable_Care_Act"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;ACA&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The rhetoric was filled with this idea that people want choice in their medical care: &lt;em&gt;people want control&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No! People want &lt;strong&gt;good health care&lt;/strong&gt;. If they don&amp;#8217;t trust systems to provide them good health care, if they don&amp;#8217;t trust their providers to understand their priorities, then &lt;em&gt;choice&lt;/em&gt; is the fallback: it&amp;#8217;s how you work the system when the system isn&amp;#8217;t working for you. And it sucks! Here you are, in the middle of some health issue, with treatments and symptoms and the rest of your life duties, and now you have to become a researcher on top of it? But the politicians and the pundits could not stop talking about&amp;nbsp;control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Control&lt;/em&gt; is what you need when you want something and it won&amp;#8217;t happen on its own. But (usually) it&amp;#8217;s not control you want, it&amp;#8217;s just a&amp;nbsp;means.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So when we say &lt;em&gt;users want control over X&lt;/em&gt; – their privacy, their security, their data, their history – we are first acknowledging that current systems act against users, but we aren&amp;#8217;t proposing any real solution. We&amp;#8217;re avoiding even talking about the&amp;nbsp;problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For instance, we say &amp;#8220;users want control over their privacy,&amp;#8221; but what people really want is some subset&amp;nbsp;of:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To avoid&amp;nbsp;embarrassment&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To avoid&amp;nbsp;persecution&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;#8230; sometimes for doing illegal and wrong&amp;nbsp;things&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To keep from having the creeping sensation they left something sitting out that they didn&amp;#8217;t want&amp;nbsp;to&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They want to make some political statement against&amp;nbsp;surveillance&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They want to keep things from the prying eyes of those close to&amp;nbsp;them&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They want to avoid being manipulated by bad-faith&amp;nbsp;messaging&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#8217;s no easy answers, not everyone holds all these desires, but these are concrete ways of thinking about what people want. They don&amp;#8217;t all point in the same direction. (And then consider the complex implications of someone else talking about&amp;nbsp;you!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are some cases when a person really does want control. If the person wants to determine their own path, if &lt;strong&gt;having choice is itself a personal goal&lt;/strong&gt;, then you need control. That&amp;#8217;s a goal about &lt;em&gt;who you are&lt;/em&gt; not just &lt;em&gt;what you get&lt;/em&gt;. It&amp;#8217;s worth identifying moments when this is important. But if a person does not pay attention to something then that person probably does not identify with the topic and is not seeking control over it. &amp;#8220;Privacy advocates&amp;#8221; pay attention to privacy, and attain a sense of identity from the very act of being mindful of their own privacy. Everyone else does&amp;nbsp;not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#8217;s think about another example: &lt;em&gt;users want control over their data&lt;/em&gt;. What are some things they&amp;nbsp;want?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They don&amp;#8217;t want to lose their&amp;nbsp;data&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They don&amp;#8217;t want their data used to hold them hostage (e.g., to a subscription&amp;nbsp;service)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They don&amp;#8217;t want to delete data and have it still&amp;nbsp;reappear&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They want to use their data however they want, but more likely they want their data available for use by some other service or&amp;nbsp;tool&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They feel it&amp;#8217;s unfair if their data is used for commercial purposes without any&amp;nbsp;compensation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They are offended if their data is used to manipulate themselves or&amp;nbsp;others&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They don&amp;#8217;t want their data used against them in manipulative&amp;nbsp;ways&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They want to have shared ownership of data with other&amp;nbsp;people&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They want to prevent unauthorized or malicious access to their&amp;nbsp;data&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again these motivations are often against each other. A person wants to be able to copy their data between services, but also delete their data permanently and completely. People don&amp;#8217;t want to lose their data, but having personal control over your data is a great way to lose it, or even to lose control over it. The professionalization and centralization of data management by services has mostly improved access control and&amp;nbsp;reliability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we simply say &lt;em&gt;users want control&lt;/em&gt; it&amp;#8217;s  giving up on understanding people&amp;#8217;s specific desires. Still it&amp;#8217;s not exactly wrong: it&amp;#8217;s reasonable to assume people will use control to achieve their desires. But if, as technologists, we can&amp;#8217;t map functionality to desire, it&amp;#8217;s a bit of a stretch to imagine everyone else will figure it out on the&amp;nbsp;fly.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="mozilla"></category></entry><entry><title>Open Source Doesn’t Make Money Because It Isn’t Designed To Make Money</title><link href="https://ianbicking.org/blog/2019/03/open-source-doesnt-make-money-by-design.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2019-03-18T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2019-03-18T00:00:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Ian Bicking</name></author><id>tag:ianbicking.org,2019-03-18:/blog/2019/03/open-source-doesnt-make-money-by-design.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or: &lt;em&gt;The Best Way To Do Something Is To At Least&amp;nbsp;Try&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We all know the story: you can&amp;#8217;t make money on open source. Is it really&amp;nbsp;true?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m thinking about this now because Mozilla would like to diversify its revenue in the next few years, and one constraint we have is that everything we do is open&amp;nbsp;source.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are dozens (hundreds?) of successful open source projects that have tried to become even just modest commercial enterprises, some very seriously. Results aren&amp;#8217;t&amp;nbsp;great.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I myself am trying to pitch a commercial endeavor in Mozilla right now (if writing up plans and sending them into the ether can qualify as &amp;#8220;pitching&amp;#8221;), and this question often comes up in feedback: can we sell something that is open&amp;nbsp;source?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have no evidence that we can (or can&amp;#8217;t), but I will make this assertion: it&amp;#8217;s hard to sell something that wasn&amp;#8217;t designed to be&amp;nbsp;sold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We treat open source like it&amp;#8217;s a poison pill for a commercial product. And yes, with an open source license it&amp;#8217;s harder to force someone to pay for a product, though many successful businesses exist without &lt;em&gt;forcing&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;anyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I see an implicit assumption that makes it harder to think about this: the idea that if something is useful, it should be profitable. It&amp;#8217;s an unspoken and morally-infused expectation, a kind of Just World hypothesis: if something has utility, if it helps people, if it&amp;#8217;s something the world needs, if it empowers other people, then there should be a revenue opportunity. It should be possible for the thing to be your day job, to make money, to see some remuneration for your successful effort in creating or doing this&amp;nbsp;thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#8217;s what we think the world &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; be like, but we all know it isn&amp;#8217;t. You can&amp;#8217;t make a living making music. Or art. You can&amp;#8217;t even make a living taking care of children. I think this underlies many of this moment&amp;#8217;s critiques of capitalism: there&amp;#8217;s too many things that are important, even needed, or that fulfill us more than any profitable item, and yet are economically&amp;nbsp;unsustainable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I won&amp;#8217;t try to fix that in this blog post, only note: not all good things make&amp;nbsp;money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But we know there is money in software. Lots of money! Is the money in secrets? If OpenSSL was secret, could it make money? If it had a licensing paywall, could it make money? Seems unlikely. The license isn&amp;#8217;t holding it back. It&amp;#8217;s just not shaped like something that makes money. Solving important problems isn&amp;#8217;t&amp;nbsp;enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what can you get paid to&amp;nbsp;do?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;People will pay a little for apps; not a lot, but a bit. Scaling up requires marketing and capital, which open source projects almost never have (and I doubt many open source projects would know what to do with capital if they had&amp;nbsp;it).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There&amp;#8217;s always money in ads. Sadly. This could potentially offend someone enough to actually repackage your open source software with ads removed. As a form of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Price_discrimination"&gt;price discrimination&lt;/a&gt; (e.g., paid ad removal) I think you could avoid&amp;nbsp;defection.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fully-hosted services: &lt;a href="https://automattic.com/"&gt;Automattic&amp;#8217;s&lt;/a&gt; wordpress.com is a good example here. Is &lt;a href="https://ghost.org/"&gt;Ghost&lt;/a&gt; doing &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OK&lt;/span&gt;? These are complete solutions: you don&amp;#8217;t just get software, you get a&amp;nbsp;website.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;People will pay if you ensure they get a personalized solution. I.e., consulting. Applied to software you get &lt;a href="https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2002/05/06/five-worlds/"&gt;consultingware&lt;/a&gt;. While often maligned, many real businesses are built on this. I think Drupal is in this&amp;nbsp;category.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;People will pay you for your dedicated and ongoing attention. In other words: a day job as an employee. It feels unfair to put this option on the list, but it&amp;#8217;s such a natural progression from consultingware, and such a dominant pattern in open source that I think it deserves&amp;nbsp;acknowledgement.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Anything paired with a physical device. People will judge the value based on the hardware and software experience&amp;nbsp;together.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I&amp;#8217;m not sure if Firefox makes money (indirectly) from ads, or as compensation for maintaining monopoly&amp;nbsp;positions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m sure I&amp;#8217;m missing some interesting ideas from that&amp;nbsp;list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But if you have a business concept, and you think it might work, what does open source even have to do with it? Don&amp;#8217;t we learn: focus on your business! On your customer! Software licensing seems like a distraction, even &lt;em&gt;software&lt;/em&gt; is a questionable thing to focus on, separate from the business. Maybe this is why you can&amp;#8217;t make money with open source: it&amp;#8217;s a distraction. The question isn&amp;#8217;t open-source-vs-proprietary, but&amp;nbsp;open-source-vs-business-focused.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another lens might be: who are you selling to? Classical scratch-your-own-itch open source software is built by programmers &lt;em&gt;for&lt;/em&gt; programmers. And it is wildly successful, but it&amp;#8217;s selling to people who aren&amp;#8217;t willing to pay. They want to take the software and turn it around into greater personal productivity (which turns out to be a smart move, given the rise in programmer wages). Can we sell open source to other people? Can anyone else &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; anything with source&amp;nbsp;code?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so I remain pessimistic that open source can find commercial success. But also frustrated: so much software is open source &lt;em&gt;except&lt;/em&gt; any commercial product. This is where the Free Software mission has faltered despite so many successes: software that people actually touch isn&amp;#8217;t free or open. That&amp;#8217;s a&amp;nbsp;shame.&lt;/p&gt;

I had a long list of things I wanted to build. Some I didn&amp;#8217;t personally want to build, but I thought they were interesting ideas. I didn&amp;#8217;t get very far through this list at all, and now that &lt;a href="https://medium.com/firefox-test-pilot/adios-amigo-51bec2a00072"&gt;Test Pilot is being retired&lt;/a&gt; I am unlikely to get to them in the&amp;nbsp;future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given this I feel I have to move this work out of my head, and publishing a list of ideas seems like an okay way to do that. Many of these ideas were inspired by something I saw in the wild, sometimes a complete product (envy on my part!), or the seed of an idea embedded in some other&amp;nbsp;product.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The experiments are a spread: some are little features that seem potentially useful. Others are features seen elsewhere that show promise from user research, but we could only ship them with confidence if we did our own analysis. Some of these are just ideas for how to explore an area more deeply, without a clear product in&amp;nbsp;mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Test Pilot&amp;#8217;s purpose was to find things worth shipping in the browser, which means some of these experiments aren&amp;#8217;t novel, but there is an underlying question: would people actually use it? We can look at competitors to get ideas, but we have to ship something ourselves if we want to analyze the&amp;nbsp;benefit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href="#sticky-reader-mode" id="sticky-reader-mode"&gt;Sticky Reader&amp;nbsp;Mode&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="mockup of Sticky Reader Mode" src="/media/mockups/sticky-readable-start.gif"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Give &lt;a href="https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/firefox-reader-view-clutter-free-web-pages"&gt;Reader Mode&lt;/a&gt; in Firefox a preference to make it per-domain sticky. E.g. if I use Reader Mode on nytimes.com and then if I visit an article on nytimes.com in the future it&amp;#8217;ll automatically convert to reader mode. (The nytimes.com homepage would not be a candidate for that&amp;nbsp;mode.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I made an experiment in &lt;a href="https://github.com/ianb/sticky-reader-mode"&gt;&lt;code&gt;sticky-reader-mode&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and I think it works really nicely. It changes the browsing experience significantly, and most importantly it doesn&amp;#8217;t require frequent proactive engagement to change behavior. Lots of these proposed ideas are tools that require high engagement by the user, and if you don&amp;#8217;t invoke the tool then they do nothing. In practice no one (myself included) remembers to invoke these tools. Once you click the preference on a site Sticky Reader Mode then you are opted in to this new experience with no further action&amp;nbsp;required.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a &lt;a href="https://github.com/ianb/sticky-reader-mode/issues/5"&gt;bunch of similar add-ons&lt;/a&gt;. Sticky Reader Mode works a bit better than most because of its interface, and it will push you directly into Reader Mode without rendering the normal page. &lt;strong&gt;But&lt;/strong&gt; it does this by using APIs that are not public to normal WebExtensions. As a result it can&amp;#8217;t be shipped outside Test Pilot, and can&amp;#8217;t go in addons.mozilla.org. So&amp;#8230; just trust me, it&amp;#8217;s&amp;nbsp;great.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently I&amp;#8217;ve come upon &lt;a href="https://brave.com/blog/speed-reader/"&gt;Brave Speed Reader&lt;/a&gt; which is similar, but without per-site opt-in, and using machine learning to identify&amp;nbsp;articles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href="#cloud-browser" id="cloud-browser"&gt;Cloud&amp;nbsp;Browser&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="mockup of a Cloud Browser" src="/media/mockups/cloud-browser-start.gif"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Run a browser/user-agent in the cloud and use a mobile view as a kind of semantic or parsed view on that user agent (the phone would just control the browser that is hosted on the cloud). At its simplest we just take the page, simplify it in a few ways, and send it on - similar to what Opera Mini does. The approach lends itself to a variety of task-oriented representations of remote&amp;nbsp;content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I first wrote this down I had just stared at my phone while it took 30 seconds to show me a 404 page. The browser probably knew after a couple seconds that it was a 404 but it acted as a rendering engine and not a user agent, so the browser insisted on faithfully rendering the useless not found&amp;nbsp;page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obviously running a full browser instance in the cloud is resource hungry and finicky but I think we could ignore those issues while testing. Those are hard but solved operational&amp;nbsp;issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prior art: Opera Mini does some of this. Puffin is specifically cloud rendering for mobile. Light Point does the same for security&amp;nbsp;reasons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I later encountered &lt;a href="https://www.brow.sh"&gt;brow.sh&lt;/a&gt; which is another interesting take on this (specifically with &lt;a href="https://html.brow.sh"&gt;html.brow.sh&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a very big task, but I still believe there&amp;#8217;s tremendous potential in it. Most of my concepts are not mobile-based, in part because I don&amp;#8217;t like mobile, I don&amp;#8217;t like myself when using a mobile device, and it&amp;#8217;s not something I want to put my energy into. But I still like this&amp;nbsp;idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href="#modal-page-actions" id="modal-page-actions"&gt;Modal Page&amp;nbsp;Actions&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="mockup of Modal Page Actions" src="/media/mockups/modal-page-actions-start.gif"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was tangentially inspired by &lt;a href="https://help.vivaldi.com/article/image-properties/"&gt;Vivaldi&amp;#8217;s Image Properties&lt;/a&gt;, not because of the interface, but thinking about how to fit high-information inspection tools into the&amp;nbsp;browser.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea: instead of context menus, &lt;a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/user_interface/Page_actions"&gt;page actions&lt;/a&gt;, or other interaction points that are part of the &amp;#8220;chrome&amp;#8221;, implement one overlay interface: the do-something-with-this-page interface. Might also be do-something-with-this-element (e.g. replacing the 7 image-related context menu items: View Image, Copy Image, Copy Image Location, Save Image As, Email Image, Set As Desktop Background, and View Image&amp;nbsp;Info).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The interface would be an overlay onto the page, similar to what happens when you start&amp;nbsp;Screenshots:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Screenshots interface" src="/media/mockups/screenshot-interface-example-small.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everything that is now in the Page Action menu (the &lt;code&gt;...&lt;/code&gt; in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;URL&lt;/span&gt; bar), or in the context menu, would be available here. Some items might have a richer interface, e.g., Send Tab To Device would show the devices directly instead of using a submenu. Bookmarking would include some inline &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UI&lt;/span&gt; for managing the resulting bookmark, and so&amp;nbsp;on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was some pushback because of the &lt;a href="https://textslashplain.com/2017/01/14/the-line-of-death/"&gt;line of death&lt;/a&gt; – that is, the idea all trusted content must clearly originate from the browser chrome, and not the content area. I do not believe in the Line of Death, it&amp;#8217;s something users &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; use to form trust, but I don&amp;#8217;t believe they &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; use it (further user research&amp;nbsp;required).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The general pattern is inspired by mobile interfaces which are typically much more modal than desktop interfaces. Modal interfaces have gotten a bad rap, I think somewhat undeserved: modal interfaces are also interfaces that guide you through processes, or ask you to explicitly dismiss the interface. It&amp;#8217;s not unreasonable to expect someone to finish what they&amp;nbsp;start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href="#find-plus-one" id="find-plus-one"&gt;Find+1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="mockup of Find + 1" src="/media/mockups/find-plus-1-start.gif"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have find-in-page but what about&amp;nbsp;find-in-anything-linked-from-this-page?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hit Cmd-Shift-F and you get an interface to do that. All the linked pages will be loaded in the background and as you search we show snippets of matching pages. Clicking on a snippet opens or focuses the tab and goes to where the search term was&amp;nbsp;found.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started experimenting in &lt;a href="https://github.com/ianb/find-plus-one"&gt;&lt;code&gt;find-plus-one&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and encountered some challenges: hidden tabs aren&amp;#8217;t good workers, loading pages in the background takes a lot of grinding in Firefox, and most links on pages are stupid (e.g., I don&amp;#8217;t want to search your Careers page). An important building block would be a way to identify the important (non-navigational) parts of a page. Maybe lighter-weight ways to load pages (in other projects I&amp;#8217;ve used &lt;a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CSP"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;CSP&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; injection). The Copy Keeper concept did come about while I experimented with&amp;nbsp;this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A simpler implementation of this might simply do a text search of all your open tabs, which would be technically simpler and mostly an exercise in making a good representation of the&amp;nbsp;results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href="#your-front-page" id="your-front-page"&gt;Your Front&amp;nbsp;Page&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="mockup of Your Front Page" src="/media/mockups/your-front-page-start.gif"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Create a front page of news from the sites you already visit. Like an &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RSS&lt;/span&gt; reader, but prepopulated with your history. This creates an immediate well-populated&amp;nbsp;experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My initial thought was to use ad hoc parsers for popular news sites, and at run an experiment with just a long whitelist of news&amp;nbsp;providers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got the feedback: why not just use &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RSS&lt;/span&gt;? Good question: I thought &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RSS&lt;/span&gt; was kind of passé, but I hadn&amp;#8217;t looked for myself. I went on to do some analysis of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RSS&lt;/span&gt;, and found it available for almost all news sites. The &lt;a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Archive/RSS/Getting_Started/Syndicating#Adding_the_.3Clink.3E"&gt;autodetection&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;link rel=alternate&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;) is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; as widely available, and it requires manual searching to find many feeds. Still &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RSS&lt;/span&gt; is a good way to get an up-to-date list of articles and their titles. Article content isn&amp;#8217;t well represented and other article metadata is inaccurate or malformed (e.g., there are no useful tags). So using &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RSS&lt;/span&gt; would be very reasonable discovery mechanism, but an &amp;#8220;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;RSS&lt;/span&gt; reader&amp;#8221; doesn&amp;#8217;t seem like a good direction on the current&amp;nbsp;web.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href="#page-archive" id="page-archive"&gt;Page&amp;nbsp;Archive&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is bringing back old functionality from Page Shot, a project of mine which morphed into &lt;a href="https://screenshots.firefox.com"&gt;Firefox Screenshots&lt;/a&gt;: save full &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DOM&lt;/span&gt; copies of pages. What used to be fairly novel is now well represented by several projects (e.g., &lt;a href="https://blog.webmemex.org/"&gt;WebMemex&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://worldbrain.io/"&gt;World Brain Memex&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately I have never been able to really make this kind of tool part of &lt;em&gt;my own&lt;/em&gt; day-to-day behavior, and I&amp;#8217;ve become skeptical it can work for a general populace. But maybe there&amp;#8217;s a way to package up this functionality that is more accessible, or happens more implicitly. I &lt;a href="https://github.com/ianb/pagearchive"&gt;forked a version of Page Shot as pagearchive&lt;/a&gt; a while ago, with this in mind, but I haven&amp;#8217;t (and likely won&amp;#8217;t) come back to&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href="#personal-historical-archive" id="personal-historical-archive"&gt;Personal Historical&amp;nbsp;Archive&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This isn&amp;#8217;t really a product idea, but instead an approach to developing&amp;nbsp;products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One can imagine many tools that directly interact or learn from the content of your browsing. There is both a privacy issue here and a privacy opportunity: looking at this data is creepy, but if the tools live in your user agent (that belongs to you and hosts your information locally) then it&amp;#8217;s not so&amp;nbsp;creepy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it&amp;#8217;s really hard to make experiments on this because you need a bunch of data. If you build a tool that starts watching your browsing then it will only slowly build up interesting information. The actual information that is already saved in browser history is interesting, but in my experience it is too limited and of poor quality. For instance, it is quite hard to build up a navigational path from the history when you use multiple&amp;nbsp;tabs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A better iterative development approach would be one where you have a static set of all the information you might want, and you can apply tools to that information. If you find something good then later you can add new data collection to the browser, secure in the knowledge that it&amp;#8217;s going to find interesting&amp;nbsp;things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spent quite a bit of effort on this, and produced &lt;a href="https://github.com/ianb/personal-history-archive"&gt;`personal-history-archive&lt;/a&gt;. It&amp;#8217;s something I still want to come back to. It&amp;#8217;s a bit of a mess, because at various times it was retrofitted to collect historical information, or collect it on an ongoing basis, or collected it when driven by a script. I also tried to build tools in parallel for doing analysis on the resulting&amp;nbsp;database.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is also a byproduct of experimentation with machine learning. I wanted to apply things I was learning to browser data, but the data I wanted wasn&amp;#8217;t there. I spent all my time collecting and cleaning data, and ended up spending only a small amount of time analyzing the data. I suspect I&amp;#8217;m not the only one who has done&amp;nbsp;this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href="#navigational-breadcrumbs" id="navigational-breadcrumbs"&gt;Navigational&amp;nbsp;Breadcrumbs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="mockup of Navigational Breadcrumbs" src="/media/mockups/navigational-breadcrumbs-start.gif"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I click on a link I lose the reminder of why I clicked on it. What on the previous page led me to click on this? Was I promised something? Are there sibling links that I might want to continue to directly instead of going back and selecting another&amp;nbsp;link?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This tool would give you additional information about the page you are on, how you got there, and given where you came from, where you might go next. Would this be a sidebar? Overlay content? In a popup? I&amp;#8217;m not&amp;nbsp;sure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Example: using this, if I click on a link from Reddit I will be able to see the title of the Reddit post (which usually doesn&amp;#8217;t match the document title), and a link to comments on the page. If I follow a link from Twitter, I&amp;#8217;ll be able to see the Tweet I came&amp;nbsp;from.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This could be interesting paired with link preview (like a tentative forward). Maybe the mobile browser &lt;a href="https://linkbubble.com/"&gt;Linkbubbles&lt;/a&gt; (now integrated into Brave) has some ideas to&amp;nbsp;offer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Technically this will use some of the techniques from Personal History Archive, which tracks link&amp;nbsp;sources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is based on the train of thought I wrote down &lt;a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=17702206"&gt;in an &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HN&lt;/span&gt; comment&lt;/a&gt; – itself a response to &lt;a href="https://www.reinterpretcast.com/open-hypermedia"&gt;Freeing the Web from the Browser&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to try this still, and have started a repo &lt;a href="https://github.com/ianb/crossnav"&gt;&lt;code&gt;crossnav&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; but haven&amp;#8217;t put anything there yet. I think even some naive approaches could work, just trying to detect the &lt;em&gt;category&lt;/em&gt; of link and the &lt;em&gt;related&lt;/em&gt; links (e.g., on Reddit the category is other submissions, and the related links are things like&amp;nbsp;comments).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href="#copy-keeper" id="copy-keeper"&gt;Copy&amp;nbsp;Keeper&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="mockup of Copy Keeper" src="/media/mockups/copy-keeper-start.gif"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A notebook/logbook that is filled in every time you copy from a web page. When you copy it records&amp;nbsp;(locally):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Text of&amp;nbsp;selection&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;HTML&lt;/span&gt; of&amp;nbsp;selection&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Screenshot of the block element around the&amp;nbsp;selection&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Text around&amp;nbsp;selection&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Page &lt;span class="caps"&gt;URL&lt;/span&gt; and nearest&amp;nbsp;anchor/id&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Page&amp;nbsp;title&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Datetime&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This overloads &amp;#8220;copy&amp;#8221; to mean&amp;nbsp;&amp;#8220;remember&amp;#8221;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clips would be searchable, and could be moved back to the clipboard in different forms (text, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HTML&lt;/span&gt;, image, bibliographical reference, source &lt;span class="caps"&gt;URL&lt;/span&gt;). Maybe clips would be browsable in a sidebar (maybe the sidebar has to be open for copies to be collected), or clips could be browsed in a normal tab&amp;nbsp;(Library-style).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I created a prototype in &lt;a href="https://github.com/ianb/copy-keeper"&gt;&lt;code&gt;copy-keeper&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. I thought it was interesting and usable, though whether it would actually get any use in practice I don&amp;#8217;t know. It&amp;#8217;s one of those tools that seems handy but requires effort, and as a result doesn&amp;#8217;t get&amp;nbsp;used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href="#change-scout" id="change-scout"&gt;Change&amp;nbsp;Scout&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="mockup of Change Scout" src="/media/mockups/change-scout-start.gif"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Wherein I both steal a &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/mozilla-scout-voice-controlled-browser-2018-6"&gt;name from another team&lt;/a&gt;, and turn it into a&amp;nbsp;category&amp;#8230;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Change Scout will monitor a page for you, and notify you when it changes. Did someone edit the document? Was there activity on an issue? Did an article get updated? Put Change Scout to track it and it will tell you what changes and&amp;nbsp;when.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It would monitor the page inside the browser, so it would have access to personalized and authenticated content. A key task would be finding ways to present changes in an interesting and compact way. In another experiment I tried some very simple change detection tools, and mostly end up frustrated (small changes look very large to naive&amp;nbsp;algorithms).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href="#popup-tab-switcher" id="popup-tab-switcher"&gt;Popup Tab&amp;nbsp;Switcher&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Tab Switcher mockup" src="/media/mockups/tab-switcher-start.gif"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We take the exact &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UI&lt;/span&gt; of the &lt;a href="https://github.com/mozilla/side-view"&gt;Side View&lt;/a&gt; popup, but make it a tab switcher. &amp;#8220;Recent Tabs&amp;#8221; are the most recently focused tabs (weighted somewhat by how long you were on the tab), and then there&amp;#8217;s the complete scrollable list. Clicking on an item simply focuses that tab. You can close tabs without focusing&amp;nbsp;them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I made a prototype in &lt;a href="https://github.com/ianb/tab-switchr"&gt;&lt;code&gt;tab-switchr&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. In it I also added some controls to close tabs, which was very useful for my periodic tab cleanups. Given that it was a proactive tool, I surprised myself by using it frequently. There&amp;#8217;s work in Firefox to improve this, unrelated to anything I&amp;#8217;ve done. It reminds me a bit of various &lt;a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/tree-style-tab/"&gt;Tree-Style Tabs&lt;/a&gt;, which I both like because they make it easier to see my tabs, and dislike because I ultimately am settled on normal top-tabs. The popup interface is less radical but still provides many of the&amp;nbsp;benefits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I should probably clean this up a little and publish&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href="#personal-podcast" id="personal-podcast"&gt;Personal&amp;nbsp;Podcast&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Create your own &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RSS&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;feed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When you are on a page with some audio source, you can add the audio to your personal&amp;nbsp;feed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When on an article, you can generate an audio version that will be added to the&amp;nbsp;feed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You get an &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RSS&lt;/span&gt; feed with a random token to make it private (I don&amp;#8217;t think podcast apps handle authentication well, but this requires&amp;nbsp;research)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maybe you can just send/text the link to add it to your preferred podcast&amp;nbsp;app&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If apps don&amp;#8217;t accept &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RSS&lt;/span&gt; links very well, maybe something more complicated would be required. An app that just installs an &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RSS&lt;/span&gt; feed? We want to avoid the feed accidentally ending up in podcast&amp;nbsp;directories.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href="#bookmark-manager" id="bookmark-manager"&gt;Bookmark&amp;nbsp;Manager&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#8217;s a lot of low-rated bookmark managers in addons.mozilla.org and the Chrome Extension store. Let&amp;#8217;s make our own low-rated bookmark&amp;nbsp;manager!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But seriously, this would anticipate updates to the Library and built-in bookmark manager, which are&amp;nbsp;deficient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some resources/ideas:
* &lt;a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=17072803"&gt;Comment with a few gripes&lt;/a&gt;
* &lt;a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/bookmark-manager/gmlllbghnfkpflemihljekbapjopfjik?hl=en"&gt;Google&amp;#8217;s bookmark manager&lt;/a&gt;

* &lt;a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/WebExtensions/API/bookmarks"&gt;Relevant WebExtension&amp;nbsp;APIs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href="#extended-library" id="extended-library"&gt;Extended&amp;nbsp;Library&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="mockup of the Extended Library" src="/media/mockups/extended-library-start.gif"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &amp;#8220;Library&amp;#8221; in Firefox is the combination history and bookmark browser you get if you use &amp;#8220;Show all bookmarks&amp;#8221; or &amp;#8220;Show all&amp;nbsp;history&amp;#8221;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this idea we present the user with a record of their &lt;strong&gt;assets&lt;/strong&gt;, wherever they&amp;nbsp;are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is like a history view (and would be built from history), but would use heuristics to pick out certain kinds of things: docs you&amp;#8217;ve edited, screenshots you&amp;#8217;ve taken, tickets you&amp;#8217;ve opened, etc. We&amp;#8217;d be trying hard to find long-lived documents in your history, instead of transitional navigation, articles, things you&amp;#8217;ve gotten to from public indexes,&amp;nbsp;etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Automatically determining what should be tagged as a &amp;#8220;library item&amp;#8221; would be the hard part. But I think having an organic view of these items, regardless of underlying service, would be quite valuable. The browser has access to all your services, and it&amp;#8217;s easy to forget what service hosts the thing you are thinking&amp;nbsp;about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href="#text-mobile-screenshot" id="text-mobile-screenshot"&gt;Text Mobile&amp;nbsp;Screenshot&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="mockup of Text Mobile Screenshot" src="/media/mockups/text-mobile-screenshot-start.gif"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This tool will render the tab in a mobile factor (using the devtools &lt;a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools/Responsive_Design_Mode"&gt;responsive design mode&lt;/a&gt;), take a full-page screenshot, and text the image and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;URL&lt;/span&gt; to a given number. Probably it would only support texting to&amp;nbsp;yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve looked into this some, and getting the mobile view of a page is not entirely obvious and requires digging around deep in the browser. Devtools does some complicated stuff to display the mobile view. The rest is basic &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UI&lt;/span&gt; flows and operational&amp;nbsp;support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href="#email-readable" id="email-readable"&gt;Email&amp;nbsp;Readable&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emails the Reader Mode version of a site to yourself. In our research, people love to store things in Email, so why&amp;nbsp;not?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though it lacks the simplicity of this concept, &lt;a href="https://github.com/mozilla/email-tabs"&gt;Email Tabs&lt;/a&gt; contains this basic functionality. &lt;a href="https://www.emailthis.me/"&gt;Email This&lt;/a&gt; does almost exactly&amp;nbsp;this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href="#your-history-everywhere" id="your-history-everywhere"&gt;Your History&amp;nbsp;Everywhere&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An extension that finds and syncs your history between browsers (particularly between Chrome and&amp;nbsp;Firefox).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This would use the &lt;a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/API/history"&gt;history WebExtension APIs&lt;/a&gt;. Maybe we could create a &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firefox_Sync"&gt;Firefox Sync&lt;/a&gt; client in Chrome. Maybe it could be a general way to move things between browsers. Actual synchronization is hard, but creating read-only views into the data in another browser profile is much&amp;nbsp;easier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obviously there&amp;#8217;s lots of work to synchronize this data between Firefox properties, and knowing the work involved this isn&amp;#8217;t easy and often involves close work with the underlying platform. Without full access to the platform (like on Chrome) we&amp;#8217;ll have to find ways to simplify the problem in order to make it&amp;nbsp;feasible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href="#my-homepage" id="my-homepage"&gt;My&amp;nbsp;Homepage&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone (with an &lt;a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/accounts/"&gt;FxA account&lt;/a&gt;) gets there own homepage on the web. It&amp;#8217;s like Geocities! Or maybe closer to&amp;nbsp;github.io.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But more seriously, it would be programmatically accessible simple static hosting. Not just for you to write your own homepage, but an open way for applications to publish user content, without those applications themselves turning into hosting platforms. We&amp;#8217;d absorb all the annoyances of hosting content (abuse, copyright, quotas, ops, financing) and let open source developers focus on enabling interesting content generation experiences for users on the open&amp;nbsp;web.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.ianbicking.org/blog/2019/01/we-need-open-hosting-platforms.html"&gt;Here&amp;#8217;s a general argument&lt;/a&gt; why I think this would be a useful thing for us to do. &lt;a href="https://blog.lmorchard.com/2014/10/09/separating-publishing-from-hosting-on-the-web/"&gt;And another from Les Orchard&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href="#studying-electron" id="studying-electron"&gt;Studying what Electron does for&amp;nbsp;people&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a proposal for user&amp;nbsp;research:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Electron apps are being shipped for many services, including services that don&amp;#8217;t require any special system integration. E.g., Slack doesn&amp;#8217;t require anything that a web browser can&amp;#8217;t do. Spotify maybe catches some play/pause keys, but is very close to being a web site. Yet there is perceived value in having an&amp;nbsp;app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The user research would focus on cases where the Electron app doesn&amp;#8217;t have any/many special permissions. What gives the app value over the web&amp;nbsp;page?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goal would be to understand the motivations and constraints of users, so we could consider ways to make the in-browser experience equally pleasant to the Electron&amp;nbsp;app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href="#app-quick-switcher" id="app-quick-switcher"&gt;App quick&amp;nbsp;switcher&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Per my previous item: why do I have an &lt;a href="https://www.irccloud.com/"&gt;IRCCloud&lt;/a&gt; app? Why do people use Slack apps? Maybe it&amp;#8217;s just because they want to be able to switch into and out of those apps&amp;nbsp;quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A proposed product solution: add a shortcut to any specific (pinned?) tab. Might be autocreated. Using the shortcut when the app is already selected will switch you back to your previous-selected tab. Switching to the tab without the shortcut will display a gentle reminder that the shortcut exists (so you can train yourself to start using&amp;nbsp;it).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To make it a little more fancy, I thought we might also be able to do a second related &amp;#8220;preview&amp;#8221; shortcut. This would let you peek into the window. I&amp;#8217;m not sure what &amp;#8220;peeking&amp;#8221; means. Maybe we just show a popup with a screenshot of that other&amp;nbsp;window.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe this should all just overload ⌘1/2/3 (maybe shift-⌘1/etc for peeking). Note these shortcuts do not currently have memory – you can switch &lt;em&gt;to&lt;/em&gt; the first tab with ⌘1, but you can&amp;#8217;t switch&amp;nbsp;back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is one suggested solution to &lt;em&gt;Whatever Electron does for people&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started some work in &lt;a href="https://github.com/ianb/quick-switch-extension"&gt;&lt;code&gt;quick-switch-extension&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, but keyboard shortcuts were a bit wonky, and I couldn&amp;#8217;t figure out useful additional functionality that would make it fun. Firefox (Nightly?) now has Ctrl-Tab functionality that takes you to recent tabs, mitigating this problem (though it is not nearly as predictable as what I propose&amp;nbsp;here).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href="#just-save" id="just-save"&gt;Just&amp;nbsp;Save&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just Save saves a page. It&amp;#8217;s like a bookmark. Or a remembering. Or an archive. Or all of those all at&amp;nbsp;once.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just Save is a one-click operation, though a popup does show up (similar in function to Pocket) that would allow some additional annotation of your saved&amp;nbsp;page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We save:
1. Link
2. Title
3. Standard metadata
4. Screenshot
5. Frozen version of page
6. Scroll position
7. The tab history
8. Remember the other open tabs, so if some of them are saved we offer later relations between them
9. Time the page was saved
10. Query terms that led to the&amp;nbsp;page&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s like bookmarks, but purely focused on saving, while bookmarks do double-duty as a navigational tool. The tool encourages after-the-fact discovery and organization, not at-the-time-of-save&amp;nbsp;choices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And of course there&amp;#8217;s a way to find and manage your saved pages. This idea needs more exploration of &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; you would return to a page or piece of information, and thus what we&amp;#8217;d want to expose and surface from your history. We&amp;#8217;ve &lt;a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/ux/2015/02/save-share-revisit/"&gt;done research&lt;/a&gt;, but it&amp;#8217;s really just a&amp;nbsp;start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href="#open-search-combined-search" id="open-search-combined-search"&gt;Open Search Combined&amp;nbsp;Search&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have several &lt;a href="https://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/browser/components/search/searchplugins"&gt;open search providers&lt;/a&gt;. How many exist out there? How many could we find in&amp;nbsp;history?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In theory &lt;a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/OpenSearch"&gt;Open Search is an &lt;span class="caps"&gt;API&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; where a user could do personalized search across many properties, though I&amp;#8217;m not sure if any sufficient number of sites has enabled&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href="#notes-commander" id="notes-commander"&gt;Notes&amp;nbsp;Commander&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s &lt;a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/notes-by-firefox/"&gt;Notes&lt;/a&gt;, but with &lt;a href="https://api.slack.com/slash-commands"&gt;slash commands&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I other words it&amp;#8217;s a document, but if you complete a line that begins with a &lt;code&gt;/&lt;/code&gt; then it will try to execute that command, appending or overwriting from that&amp;nbsp;point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So for instance &lt;code&gt;/timestamp&lt;/code&gt; just replaces itself with a&amp;nbsp;timestamp.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe &lt;code&gt;/page&lt;/code&gt; inserts the currently active tab. &lt;code&gt;/search foo&lt;/code&gt; puts search results into the document, but as editable (and followable) links. &lt;code&gt;/page save&lt;/code&gt; freezes the page as one big data link, and inserts that link into the&amp;nbsp;note.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s a little like Slack, but in document form, and with the browser as the context instead of a messaging platform. It&amp;#8217;s a little like a notebook programming interface, but less structured and more&amp;nbsp;document-like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ability to edit the &lt;em&gt;output&lt;/em&gt; of commands is particularly interesting to me, and represents the kind of ad hoc information organizing that we all do&amp;nbsp;regularly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I experimented some with this in Notes, and got it working a little bit, but working with CKEditor (that Notes is built on) was just awful and I couldn&amp;#8217;t get anything to work well. Notes also has a very limited set of supported content (no images or links), which was problematic. Maybe it&amp;#8217;s worth doing it from scratch (with &lt;a href="http://prosemirror.net/"&gt;ProseMirror&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://github.com/ianstormtaylor/slate"&gt;Slate&lt;/a&gt;?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After I tried to mock this up, I realized that the underlying model is much too unclear in my mind. What&amp;#8217;s this for? &lt;em&gt;When&lt;/em&gt; is it for? What would a list of commands look&amp;nbsp;like?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another thing I realized while attempting a mockup is that there should be a rich but normalized way to represent pages and URLs and so forth. Often you&amp;#8217;ll be referring to URLs of pages that are already open. You may want to open sets of pages, or see immediately which URLs are already open in a tab. A frozen version of a page should be clearly linked to the source of that page, which of course could be an open tab. There&amp;#8217;s a lot of pieces to fit together here, both common nouns and verbs, all of which interact with the browser session&amp;nbsp;itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href="#automater" id="automater"&gt;Automater&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Automation and scripting for your browser: make demonstrations for your browser, give it a name, and you have a repeatable&amp;nbsp;script.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The scripts will happen in the browser itself, not via any backend or scraping tool. In case of failed expectations or changed sites, the script will halt and tell the&amp;nbsp;user.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scripts could be as simple as &amp;#8220;open a new tab pointing to this page every weekday at 9am&amp;#8221;, or could involve clipping information, or just doing a navigational pattern before presenting the page to a&amp;nbsp;user.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#8217;s a huge amount of previous work in this area. I think the challenge here is to create something that &lt;em&gt;doesn&amp;#8217;t&lt;/em&gt; look like a programming language displayed in a&amp;nbsp;table.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href="#sidekick" id="sidekick"&gt;Sidekick&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sidekick is a sidebar interface to anything, or everything, contextually. Some things it might&amp;nbsp;display:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Show you the state of your&amp;nbsp;clipboard&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Show you how you got to the current tab (similar to &lt;a href="#navigational-breadcrumbs"&gt;Navigational Breadcrumbs&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Show you other items from the search query that kicked off the current&amp;nbsp;tab&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Give quick navigation to nearby pages, given the referring page (e.g., the next link, or next set of&amp;nbsp;links)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Show you buttons to activate other tabs you are likely to switch to from the current&amp;nbsp;tab&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Show shopping recommendations or other content-aware&amp;nbsp;widgets&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Let you save little tidbits (text, links, etc), like an extended clipboard or&amp;nbsp;notepad&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Show notifications you&amp;#8217;ve recently&amp;nbsp;received&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Peek into other tabs, or load them inline somewhat like &lt;a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/side-view/"&gt;Side&amp;nbsp;View&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Checklists and&amp;nbsp;todos&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Copy a bunch of links into the sidebar, then treat them like a&amp;nbsp;todo/queue&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Possibly it could be treated like an extensible widget&amp;nbsp;holder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From another perspective: this is like a continuous contextual feature recommender. I.e., it would try to answer the question: what&amp;#8217;s the feature you could use right&amp;nbsp;now?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href="#timed-repetition" id="timed-repetition"&gt;Timed&amp;nbsp;Repetition&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generally in order to commit something to long-term memory you must revisit information later, ideally long enough that it&amp;#8217;s a&amp;nbsp;struggle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is anything we see in a browser worth committing to long-term memory? Sometimes it feels like nothing is worth remembering, but that&amp;#8217;s a kind of nihilism based on the shitty aspects of typical web browsing&amp;nbsp;behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The interface would require some positive assertion: I want to know this. Probably you&amp;#8217;d want to highlight the thing you&amp;#8217;d &amp;#8220;know&amp;#8221;. Then, later, we&amp;#8217;d want to come up with some challenge. We don&amp;#8217;t need a &amp;#8220;real&amp;#8221; test that is verified by the browser, instead we simply need to ask some related question, then the user can say if they got it right or not (or remembered it or&amp;nbsp;not).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;More information on the general technique in the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition"&gt;Spaced Repetition Wikipedia article&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incremental_reading"&gt;Incremental Reading&lt;/a&gt; is an approach to information consumption paired with flashcard&amp;nbsp;review.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://apps.ankiweb.net/"&gt;Anki&lt;/a&gt; is the most prominent open source software in this area.  Oddly while there is a lot of WebExtension-based intake software for it, the actual testing is primarily done in a native&amp;nbsp;app.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://sansforgetica.rmit/"&gt;A bizarre hard-to-read font&lt;/a&gt; meant to aid in&amp;nbsp;memory.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href="#reader-mode-improvements" id="reader-mode-improvements"&gt;Reader Mode&amp;nbsp;improvements&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reader mode is a bit spartan. Maybe it could be a bit&amp;nbsp;nicer:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pick up some styles or backgrounds from the hosting&amp;nbsp;site&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Display images or other media differently or more&amp;nbsp;prominently&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add back some markup or layout that Readability&amp;nbsp;erases&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Apply to some other kinds of sites that aren&amp;#8217;t articles (e.g., a video&amp;nbsp;site)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A multicolumn version like &lt;a href="https://anoved.github.io/mcreadability/"&gt;McReadability&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href="#digest-mode" id="digest-mode"&gt;Digest&amp;nbsp;Mode&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inspired by &lt;a href="http://www.fullhn.com/"&gt;Full Hacker News&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=18132281"&gt;comments&lt;/a&gt;): take a bunch of links (typically articles) and concatenate their content into one&amp;nbsp;page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Implicitly this requires Reader Mode parsing of the pages, though that is relatively cheap for &amp;#8220;normal&amp;#8221; articles. Acquiring a list of pages is somewhat less clear. Getting a list of pages is a kind of news/&lt;span class="caps"&gt;RSS&lt;/span&gt; question. Taking a page &lt;em&gt;like&lt;/em&gt; Hacker News and figuring out what the &amp;#8220;real&amp;#8221; links are is another approach that may be interesting. Lists of related links are everywhere, yet hard to formally&amp;nbsp;define.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This would work very nicely with complementary text&amp;nbsp;summarization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Open question: is this actually an interesting or useful way to consume&amp;nbsp;information?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href="#firefox-for-x" id="firefox-for-x"&gt;Firefox for&amp;nbsp;X&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#8217;s an underlying concept here worth&amp;nbsp;explaining:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Feature develop receives a lot of skepticism. And it&amp;#8217;s reasonable: there&amp;#8217;s a lot of conceit in a feature, especially embedded in a large product. Are people going to use a product or not because of some little feature? Or maybe the larger challenge: can some feature actually change behavior? Every person has their own thing going on, people aren&amp;#8217;t interested in our theories, and really not that many people are interested in browsers. Familiar functionality – the back button, bookmarks, the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;URL&lt;/span&gt; bar, etc. – are what they expect, what they came for, and what they will gravitate to. Everything I&amp;#8217;ve written so far in this list are things &lt;em&gt;people won&amp;#8217;t actually use&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A browser is particularly problematic because it&amp;#8217;s so universal. It&amp;#8217;s for sites and apps and articles. It&amp;#8217;s for the young and the elderly, the experienced and not. It&amp;#8217;s used for serious things, it&amp;#8217;s used for concentration, and it&amp;#8217;s used for dumb things and to avoid concentrating. How can you build a feature for everyone, targeting anything they might do? And if you build something, how can a person trust a new feature is really for &lt;em&gt;them&lt;/em&gt;, not some other person? People are right to be skeptical of the&amp;nbsp;new!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But we also know that most people regularly use more than one browser. Some people use Chrome for personal stuff, and Firefox for work. Some people do the exact opposite. Some people do their banking and finance in a specific browser. Some use a specific browser just for watching&amp;nbsp;videos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Which&lt;/em&gt; browser a person uses for which task is seemingly random. Maybe they were told to use a specific browser for one task, and then the other browser became the fallback. Maybe they once heard somewhere once that one browser was more secure. Maybe flash seemed broken on one browser when they were watching a video, and now a pattern has been&amp;nbsp;set.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This has long seemed like an opportunity to me. Market a browser that actually claims to be the right browser for some of these purposes! Firefox has &lt;a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/developer/"&gt;Developer Edition&lt;/a&gt; and it&amp;#8217;s been reasonably&amp;nbsp;successful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This offers an opportunity for both Mozilla and Firefox users to agree on &lt;strong&gt;purpose&lt;/strong&gt;. What is Firefox for? Everything! Is this feature meant for &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt;? Unlikely! In a purpose-built browser both sides can agree what it&amp;#8217;s trying to&amp;nbsp;accomplish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This idea often gets poo-pooed for how much work it is, but I think it&amp;#8217;s simpler than it seems. Here&amp;#8217;s what a &amp;#8220;new browser&amp;#8221;&amp;nbsp;means:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Something you can find and download from its own page or&amp;nbsp;site&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It&amp;#8217;s Firefox, but uses its own &lt;a href="https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/profiles-where-firefox-stores-user-data"&gt;profile&lt;/a&gt;, keeping history/etc separate from other browser instances (including&amp;nbsp;Firefox)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It has its own name and icon, and probably a theme to make it obvious what browser you are&amp;nbsp;in&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It comes with some browser extensions and prefs changed, making it more appropriate for the proposed use&amp;nbsp;case&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The approach is heavy on marketing and build tools, and light on actual browser&amp;nbsp;engineering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also have gotten frequent feedback that &lt;a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/multi-account-containers/"&gt;Multi-Account Containers&lt;/a&gt; should solve all these use cases, but that gets everything backwards. People already understand multiple browsers, and having completely new entry points to bring people to Firefox is a feature, not a&amp;nbsp;bug.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sadly I think the time for this has passed, maybe in the market generally or maybe just for Mozilla. It would have been a very different approach to the&amp;nbsp;browser.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of us in the Test Pilot team had some good brainstorming around actual concepts too, which is where I actually get excited about the&amp;nbsp;ideas:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href="#firefox-study" id="firefox-study"&gt;Firefox&amp;nbsp;Study&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For students,&amp;nbsp;studying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Integrate note-taking&amp;nbsp;tools&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create project and class-based organizational tools, helping to organize tabs, bookmarks, and&amp;nbsp;notes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tools to document and organize&amp;nbsp;deadlines&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Citation&amp;nbsp;generators&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#8217;t know &lt;em&gt;what&lt;/em&gt; to do with online lectures and video, but it feels like there&amp;#8217;s some meaningful improvements to be done in that space. Video-position-aware notetaking&amp;nbsp;tools?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think the intentionality of opening a browser to study is a good thing. iPads are somewhat popular in education, and I suspect part of that is having a device that isn&amp;#8217;t built around multitasking, and using an iPad means stepping away from regular&amp;nbsp;computing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href="#firefox-media" id="firefox-media"&gt;Firefox&amp;nbsp;Media&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To watch videos. This requires very few features, but benefits from just being a separate profile, history, and&amp;nbsp;icon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#8217;s a small number of features that might be&amp;nbsp;useful:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cross-service search (like &lt;a href="http://www.canistream.it/"&gt;Can I Stream.it&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.justwatch.com/"&gt;JustWatch&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Search defaults to video&amp;nbsp;search&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cross-service&amp;nbsp;queue&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Quick service-based&amp;nbsp;navigation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I realize it&amp;#8217;s a lot like Roku in an&amp;nbsp;app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href="#firefox-for-finance" id="firefox-for-finance"&gt;Firefox for&amp;nbsp;Finance&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is really just about&amp;nbsp;security.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Funny story: people say they value security very highly. But if Mozilla wants to make changes in Firefox that increase security but break some sites – particularly insecure sites – people will then stop using Firefox. They value security highly, but still just below &lt;em&gt;anything at all breaking&lt;/em&gt;. This is very frustrating for&amp;nbsp;us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the same time, I kind of get it. I&amp;#8217;m dorking around on the web and I click through to some dumb site, and I get a big ol&amp;#8217; warning or a blank page or some other weirdness. I didn&amp;#8217;t even care about the page or its security, and here my browser is trying to make me&amp;nbsp;care.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#8217;s true some of the time, but not others. If you are using Firefox for Finance, or Firefox Super Secure, or whatever we might call it, then you really do&amp;nbsp;care.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#8217;s a second kind of security implied here as well: security from snooping eyes and on shared computers. &lt;a href="https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/use-master-password-protect-stored-logins"&gt;Firefox Master Password&lt;/a&gt; is a useful feature here. Generally there&amp;#8217;s an opportunity for secure data at&amp;nbsp;rest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is also a vehicle for education in computer security, with an audience that we know is&amp;nbsp;interested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href="#firefox-low-bandwidth" id="firefox-low-bandwidth"&gt;Firefox Low&amp;nbsp;Bandwidth&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe we work with proxy services. Or just do lots of content blocking. In this browser we let content break (and give a control to load the full content), so long as you start out&amp;nbsp;compact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cache content that isn&amp;#8217;t really supposed to be&amp;nbsp;cached&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don&amp;#8217;t load some kinds of&amp;nbsp;content&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Block fonts and other seemingly-unimportant&amp;nbsp;content&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Monitoring tools to see where bandwidth usage is&amp;nbsp;going&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href="#firefox-for-kids" id="firefox-for-kids"&gt;Firefox for&amp;nbsp;Kids&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sadly making things for kids is hard, because you are obliged to do all sorts of things if you claim to target children, but you don&amp;#8217;t have to do anything if kids just happen to use your&amp;nbsp;tool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is an industry of tools in this area that I don&amp;#8217;t fully understand, and I&amp;#8217;d want to research before thinking about a feature list. But it seems like it comes down to three&amp;nbsp;things:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Blocking problematic&amp;nbsp;content&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Encouraging positive&amp;nbsp;content&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Monitoring tools for&amp;nbsp;parents&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#8217;s something very uninspiring about that list, it feels like it&amp;#8217;s long on negativity and short on positive engagement. Coming up with an answer to that is not a simple&amp;nbsp;task.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href="#firefox-calm" id="firefox-calm"&gt;Firefox&amp;nbsp;Calm&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inspired by a bunch of&amp;nbsp;things:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://humanetech.com/"&gt;Humane&amp;nbsp;Tech&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.getsiempo.com/"&gt;Siempo&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/05/19/siempos-new-app-will-break-your-smartphone-addiction/"&gt;some coverage&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="#sticky-reader-mode"&gt;Sticky Reader&amp;nbsp;Mode&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What would a calm Firefox experience look like? Or maybe it would be better to think about a calm presentation of the web. At some point I wrote out some short&amp;nbsp;pitches:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Read without distraction: Read articles like they are articles, not interactive (and manipulative)&amp;nbsp;experiences.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stay focused on one thing at a time: Instead of a giant list of tabs and alerts telling you what we aren&amp;#8217;t doing, automatically focus on the one thing you are doing right&amp;nbsp;now.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Control your notifications: Instead of letting any site poke at you for any reason, notifications are kept to a minimum and&amp;nbsp;batched.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Focused writing: When you need to focus on what you are saying, not what people are saying to you, enter focused writing&amp;nbsp;mode.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Get updates without falling down a news hole: Avoid clickbait, don&amp;#8217;t reload pages, just see updates from the sites you trust (relates to &lt;a href="#your-front-page"&gt;Your Front Page&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pomodoro: let yourself get distracted&amp;#8230; but only a little bit. The Pomodoro technique helps you switch between periods of focused work and letting yourself&amp;nbsp;relax&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don&amp;#8217;t even ask: Do you want notifications from the news site you visited once? Do you want videos to autoplay? Of course not, and we&amp;#8217;ll stop even&amp;nbsp;asking.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Suggestion-free browsing: Every page you look at isn&amp;#8217;t an invitation to tell you what you should look at next. Remove suggested content, and do what &lt;span class="caps"&gt;YOU&lt;/span&gt; want to do next. (&lt;a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/remove-youtube-s-suggestions/"&gt;YouTube example&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="#conclusion" id="conclusion"&gt;Concluding&amp;nbsp;thoughts&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not just the conclusion of this list, the conclusion of my work in this&amp;nbsp;area&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some challenges in the design&amp;nbsp;process:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Asking someone to &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; something new is hard, and unlikely to happen. My previous post (&lt;a href="http://www.ianbicking.org/blog/2019/01/overengaged-knowledge-worker.html"&gt;The Over-engaged Knowledge Worker&lt;/a&gt;) relates to this&amp;nbsp;tension.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;#8230; and yet a &amp;#8220;problem&amp;#8221; isn&amp;#8217;t enough to get someone to do something&amp;nbsp;either.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If someone is consciously &lt;em&gt;and specifically&lt;/em&gt; doing some task, then there&amp;#8217;s an&amp;nbsp;opportunity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Creating wholistic solutions is unwelcome, unintuitively each thing that adds to the size of a solution &lt;em&gt;diminishes&lt;/em&gt; from the breadth of problems the solution can&amp;nbsp;solve.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;#8230; and yet, abstract solutions without any clear suggestion of what they solve aren&amp;#8217;t great&amp;nbsp;either!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Figuring out how to package functionality is a big&amp;nbsp;deal.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Approaches that increase the density of information or choices are themselves somewhat&amp;nbsp;burdensome.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;#8230; and yet context-sensitive approaches are unpredictable and distracting compared to consistent (if dense)&amp;nbsp;functionality.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I still believe there&amp;#8217;s a wealth of material in the &lt;em&gt;content&lt;/em&gt; of the pages people encounter. But it&amp;#8217;s irregular and hard to understand, it takes concerted and long-term effort to do something&amp;nbsp;here.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lots of the easy stuff, the roads well traveled, are still hard for a lot of people. Maybe this can be fixed by optimizing current &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UI&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8230; but I think there&amp;#8217;s still room for novel improvements to old&amp;nbsp;ideas.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;User research is a really great place to start, but it&amp;#8217;s not very prescriptive. It&amp;#8217;s mostly problem-finding, not&amp;nbsp;solution-finding.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There&amp;#8217;s some kinds of user research I wish I had access to, specifically really low level analysis of behavior. What&amp;#8217;s in someone&amp;#8217;s mind when they open a new tab, or reuse one? In what order do they scan the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UI&lt;/span&gt;? What are mental models of a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;URL&lt;/span&gt;, of pages and how they change, in what order to people compose (mentally and physically) things they want to share&amp;#8230; it feels like it can go on forever, and there would be a ton of detail in the results, but given all the other constraints these insights feel&amp;nbsp;important.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There&amp;#8217;s so many variables in an experiment, that it&amp;#8217;s hard to know what failures really means. Every experiment that offers a novel experience involves several choices, and any one choice can cause the experiment to&amp;nbsp;fail.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Test Pilot comes to an end, I do find myself asking: is there room for qualitative improvements in desktop browser &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UI&lt;/span&gt;? Desktop computing is waning. User expectations of a browser are calcified. The only time people make a choice is when something breaks, and the only way to win is to not break anything and hope you competitor &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; break&amp;nbsp;things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, is there room for improvement? Of course there is! The millions of hours spent every day in Firefox alone&amp;#8230; &lt;em&gt;this is actually important&lt;/em&gt;. Yes, a lot of things are at a local maximum, and we can A/B test little tweaks to get some suboptimal parts to &lt;em&gt;their&lt;/em&gt; local maximum. But I do not believe in any way that the browsers we know are the optimal container. The web is bigger than browsers, bigger than desktop or mobile or &lt;span class="caps"&gt;VR&lt;/span&gt;, and a user agent can do unique things beyond any site or&amp;nbsp;app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And&amp;nbsp;yet&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19304802"&gt;Hack News Comments&lt;/a&gt; if that&amp;#8217;s your&amp;nbsp;thing.&lt;/p&gt;

Along the way people imagined idealized workflows and the tools that could enable them. This result felt familiar from concept videos since forever (such as &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYMA5W8b1zY"&gt;this old Mozilla concept video&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The result featured lots of jet-setting highly engaged people deep in collaboration. For instance: Joe sends his friend a mortgage refinancing proposal to get&amp;nbsp;feedback.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;None of my friends have ever just blasted a mortgage refinancing proposal to me for a quick review. Thank god. But I&amp;#8217;ve gotten similar requests, we all have, and nobody wants to receive these things. Usually the request sits guiltily in my inbox, mocking me and my purported friendship. If it&amp;#8217;s job-related I will eventually get to even the work I loathe, but there&amp;#8217;s always a particular pile of work that haunts me. This is not&amp;nbsp;engagement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the reality of knowledge work that none of these conceptualizations address: it&amp;#8217;s hard (in very specific ways), some of it we don&amp;#8217;t want to do, and the work we don&amp;#8217;t want to do piles up and becomes dominant simply because it remains&amp;nbsp;undone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our real work looks different than how we idealize our work: work items are smaller, less impactful, higher-touch, and collaboration spreads work out over time, decreasing personal engagement. We also imagine situations where people are much more actively engaged as a total percentage of their interactions, while we spend a lot of time passively receiving information, or simply deciding: what, if anything, should I react&amp;nbsp;to?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;So then&amp;nbsp;what?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So how might we approach idea generation around knowledge work without idealizing the knowledge&amp;nbsp;worker?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We could still go too far into acceptance. We&amp;#8217;d build &lt;a href="https://www.arkadium.com/newsroom/microsoft-solitaire-most-boring-game-tops-100-million-users/"&gt;solitaire&lt;/a&gt; into the browser, the ultimate knowledge worker tool. It&amp;#8217;s what people want! People shouldn&amp;#8217;t have to pick up their phones to be distracted, we should keep the web as the universal distraction platform it was always meant to be. Oops, I make the mistake of thinking phone-vs-web, rather we should focus on providing &lt;em&gt;distraction continuity&lt;/em&gt; across all your platforms. Sorry, this sarcasm is becoming&amp;nbsp;uncomfortable&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m not sure a distraction tool is wrong. Giving people a mental break when they want it, &lt;em&gt;but without trying to capture those people&lt;/em&gt;, could be positive. The web is full of mental breaks, but they aren&amp;#8217;t &amp;#8220;breaks&amp;#8221;, they are manufactured to hold onto attention long after the needed break has&amp;nbsp;finished.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But if we don&amp;#8217;t build engagement tools (because people aren&amp;#8217;t looking to be more engaged) and we don&amp;#8217;t build distraction tools (because a web browser is already a sufficiently good distraction tool), what do we&amp;nbsp;build?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think there&amp;#8217;s more opportunity in accepting the mentally fatigued and distracted state of knowledge workers, and working &lt;em&gt;from&lt;/em&gt; that instead of against it. With that in mind I&amp;#8217;d break down the problem into a few&amp;nbsp;categories:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reduce the drain of knowledge work, so that distractions are less&amp;nbsp;necessary.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Support positive mental&amp;nbsp;relaxation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Support continuity of mental effort; make it easier to &lt;em&gt;get back on track&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I&amp;#8217;d leave&amp;nbsp;out:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Efficiency: usually efficiency means speed, number of steps, integrations, and so it calls for higher engagement. We care about efficiency, but only the &lt;em&gt;efficient use of mental resources&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Blocking distractions: people want something out of distractions, and while we might aspire to replace distractions it&amp;#8217;s probably unsustainable to block those distractions. Blocking is like starting an exercise plan by getting rid of all your&amp;nbsp;chairs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Communication and collaboration: even if distractions don&amp;#8217;t break your continuity, collaboration will! Collaboration is obviously an interesting space, but you can&amp;#8217;t do anything without pulling your collaborators into yet another tool. Trying to convert other people to a new way of working is not mentally&amp;nbsp;relaxing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#8217;s where I throw my hands up and admit that I don&amp;#8217;t have solutions to these problems, just a new problem&amp;nbsp;statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it does point in some different directions: how do we support a continuity of intention across a long task? In the context of the browser, how do we contextualize pages and interactions inside some abstract task? How do we clarify context? If the human is forced to multitask, can the multitasking tools be grounding instead of stretching us&amp;nbsp;out?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The resulting exploration is not one that constructs an enviable user. It&amp;#8217;s a user with virtual piles of papers on their desk with a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PB&lt;/span&gt;&amp;amp;J forgetten a third of the way down, with a People Magazine placed sneakily inside an important report, with a pile of mail and every single piece is marked Urgent: Open Immediately. People aren&amp;#8217;t always &lt;a href="https://www.curbed.com/2016/7/18/12215158/always-be-knolling-tom-sachs-knoll"&gt;knolling&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#8230; but maybe we could&amp;nbsp;be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But most users don&amp;#8217;t care about the principles or implementation of an open web, at least not in those terms. Most people don&amp;#8217;t see themselves as ever having left the open web behind, and if you told them to try to get back to it, they wouldn&amp;#8217;t know what to do or why it was&amp;nbsp;worthwhile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No matter how much it might be in their long-term self interest, it&amp;#8217;s not up to the casual Internet user to figure that out. &lt;strong&gt;Instead, it&amp;#8217;s up to the developers, designers, entrepreneurs and technology leaders to create a version of the open web that also happens to be the best version of the&amp;nbsp;web.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think he&amp;#8217;s starting with a reasonable, positive call: we can&amp;#8217;t just decry the state of things, we have to make things. And we have to make &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt; things. The open web &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; be&amp;nbsp;better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I fear a moralizing approach to advocacy pushes people away, makes it &lt;em&gt;harder&lt;/em&gt; for people to care about the values we are espousing. When we frame something as depressing or hopeless we encourage people to pay attention to other things. So yes: the open web should be the best&amp;nbsp;web.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But ignoring my advice, I&amp;#8217;m going to point out a depressing fact: open source &lt;em&gt;products&lt;/em&gt; aren&amp;#8217;t successful. Open source is not in line to be part of any&amp;nbsp;solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Open Source has done a lot for developers, but it&amp;#8217;s not present on the surface of the web – the surface that people interact with, and that defines the &amp;#8220;open web&amp;#8221;. Actual sites. Actual interfaces. Open source is used everywhere &lt;em&gt;except&lt;/em&gt; at the point of interaction with actual&amp;nbsp;people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why is open source so&amp;nbsp;absent?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One big problem: the web isn&amp;#8217;t software. The web is deployed software, running on&amp;nbsp;servers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If, as a creator of software, I want to share what I&amp;#8217;ve done with everyone on the web – not just with other developers – then I actually have to deploy that software somewhere. But if maintaining open source is difficult and unsustainable, hosting that software is even&amp;nbsp;worse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I could create a whole company to support the service. But at that point I&amp;#8217;m not a developer, I&amp;#8217;m an &amp;#8220;entrepreneur&amp;#8221;. That&amp;#8217;s more of a pain in the ass than giving stuff&amp;nbsp;away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For open source developers to build the open web we need a platform that allows us to actually give the tools we&amp;#8217;ve created to everyone. Because of the hosting problem all our open source work is mediated through commercial entities, and we have this world where the web is very much built on open source, and yet that does nothing to make it more&amp;nbsp;open.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An open hosting platform is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; a specification, it is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; a protocol, it is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; a piece of software. It is actual hosting. It is people who deal with abuse, security, takedown notices, denial of service attacks, naming, bill paying, authentication and recovery, and are committed to ongoing improvements to the platform. Those are the things that separate software from a running service, and only running services can participate in the open&amp;nbsp;web.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#8217;t think decentralization, federation, or &lt;span class="caps"&gt;P2P&lt;/span&gt; is important or probably even desirable. I think these are ways to avoid the work of hosting, and they succeed to the degree no one uses the resulting software and so no work has to be done. It&amp;#8217;s better to start with a working&amp;nbsp;product.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Would hosting change things? Probably not enough: products aren&amp;#8217;t just software, and open source development still struggles to include a diversity of skills and the consistent delivery of effort to make a product. Here, I have no suggestions. But still, an open, public, accessible hosting platform would be a&amp;nbsp;start.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="mozilla"></category></entry><entry><title>Viewing Python execution with source code rewriting</title><link href="https://ianbicking.org/blog/2018/11/viewing-python-execution-source-code-rewriting.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2018-11-20T00:00:00-06:00</published><updated>2018-11-20T00:00:00-06:00</updated><author><name>Ian Bicking</name></author><id>tag:ianbicking.org,2018-11-20:/blog/2018/11/viewing-python-execution-source-code-rewriting.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;A while back I experimented with a &lt;a href="https://github.com/ianb/sheets"&gt;Jupyter Notebook-like&lt;/a&gt; interface.

Ultimately I hit some roadblocks and knew that I couldn&amp;#8217;t keep working on it indefinitely, as I had no personal &lt;em&gt;purpose&lt;/em&gt; for the&amp;nbsp;project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I do want to share the idea I most liked from the project: tracing execution with source code&amp;nbsp;rewriting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Print-based&amp;nbsp;debugging&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My go-to debugging in any environment is printing. You decide what you want to know about, then you sprinkle in some statements and find out. Repeat as necessary. I like printing because it&amp;#8217;s like a way of creating a log of the execution. Maybe there&amp;#8217;s better ways, but like many people this is one of the only techniques that sticks for me. Still, I think there&amp;#8217;s ways of incrementally improving on print-based debugging, and this is one attempt on my&amp;nbsp;part&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Source code&amp;nbsp;rewriting&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of using &lt;a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/trace.html"&gt;trace&lt;/a&gt; to follow along with the code, I thought we could inject the debugging into the code&amp;nbsp;itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I ended up implementing two kinds of source code rewriting. The first simply prints&amp;nbsp;expressions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;my_object&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;MyObject&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;param&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;my_object&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;execute&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;my_object&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This normally prints out &lt;code&gt;my_object&lt;/code&gt;, but it only works on the last expression (i.e., you wouldn&amp;#8217;t see the value of &lt;code&gt;my_object.execute()&lt;/code&gt;). This constraint is built into Python in &lt;a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#compile"&gt;compile&lt;/a&gt;, with the output being sent to &lt;a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#sys.displayhook"&gt;sys.displayhook&lt;/a&gt;. You can get around this problem by splitting up the cells carefully, but I find cell management to be an unpleasant part of notebook&amp;nbsp;interfaces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I first tried putting an implicit &lt;code&gt;print()&lt;/code&gt; around every top-level expression, so it&amp;nbsp;becomes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;my_object&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;MyObject&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;params&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;display_print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;my_object&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;execute&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;())&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;display_print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;my_object&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Where &lt;code&gt;display_print()&lt;/code&gt; is something simple&amp;nbsp;like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;display_print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;value&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;is&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;not&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;None&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nb"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;repr&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This turned out to be confusing. What print statement went with which expression? I legitimately couldn&amp;#8217;t tell, even with simple examples. So I made another change, rewriting it like&amp;nbsp;this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;my_object&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;MyObject&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;params&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;display_print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;my_object.execute()&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;my_object&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;execute&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;())&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;display_print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;my_object&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;my_object&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;display_print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;expr&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;value&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;is&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;not&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;None&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nb"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;%s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="se"&gt;\n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;%r&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;%&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;expr&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;It works great! You can track a bunch of expressions, interleave this with other explicit print statements, and the output is readable and&amp;nbsp;useful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Probes&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I had a problem: I could watch top-level expressions, but there were lots of interesting expressions that aren&amp;#8217;t top-level. For this I added a new function &lt;code&gt;watch()&lt;/code&gt;. But I still rewrote&amp;nbsp;expressions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;my_object&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;MyObject&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;obj&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;object_enumerator&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;():&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;my_object&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;process&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;watch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;obj&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;is rewritten&amp;nbsp;to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;my_object&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;MyObject&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;obj&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;object_enumerator&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;():&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;my_object&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;process&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;watch_print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;obj&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;obj&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# the 1 is an ID for the expression&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;With an implementation of &lt;code&gt;watch_print()&lt;/code&gt; like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;watch_print_counter&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;watch_print_limit&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;watch_print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;expr&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;value&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;is&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;not&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;None&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;and&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;watch_print_counter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;watch_print_limit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nb"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;%s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="se"&gt;\n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;%r&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;%&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;expr&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;watch_print_counter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;watch_print_counter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;watch_print_counter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;watch_print_limit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="nb"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;  (omitting further values)&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;While I initially left out the limit, I quickly realized its importance: it&amp;#8217;s very easy to run a denial of service attack on your own notebook! A more sophisticated implementation could start omitting values while leaving in every 100th or 1000th&amp;nbsp;value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Watching&amp;nbsp;loops&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I never implemented this, but I&amp;#8217;m pretty sure the next step would be watching all loops, rewriting them as something&amp;nbsp;like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;obj&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;watch_enumerator&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;obj&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;object_enumerator()&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;object_enumerator&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()):&lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;span class="o"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This would let you print out useful information, like if the execution is long you can indicate progress and possibly an expected completion time, or you could label inner watch statements or add other&amp;nbsp;information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Implementation&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To implement this I used the &lt;a href="https://astor.readthedocs.io/en/latest/"&gt;astor&lt;/a&gt; library, which made this all very simple, though it required some&amp;nbsp;experimentation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;RewriteExprToPrint&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;astor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;TreeWalk&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;post_Module&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;node&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;cur_node&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;node&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;body&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;rewrite_expr&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;isinstance&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;ast&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Expr&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;else&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;n&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;n&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;node&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;body&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;rewrite_expr&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;node&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;expr_string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kc"&gt;None&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;expr_string&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;is&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;None&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="n"&gt;expr_string&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;astor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;to_source&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;node&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;node_string&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;ast&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Str&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;expr_string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;isinstance&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;node&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;ast&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Expr&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="n"&gt;new_node&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;ast&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Expr&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="n"&gt;ast&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Call&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
                    &lt;span class="n"&gt;func&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ast&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;display_print&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;ctx&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ast&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Load&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()),&lt;/span&gt;
                    &lt;span class="n"&gt;args&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;node_string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;node&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt;
                    &lt;span class="n"&gt;keywords&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[],&lt;/span&gt;
                    &lt;span class="n"&gt;starargs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kc"&gt;None&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;else&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="n"&gt;new_node&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;ast&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Call&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="n"&gt;func&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ast&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;display_print&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;ctx&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ast&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Load&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()),&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="n"&gt;args&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;node_string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;node&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="n"&gt;keywords&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[],&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="n"&gt;starargs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kc"&gt;None&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;ast&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;fix_missing_locations&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;new_node&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;new_node&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Implementing &lt;code&gt;watch()&lt;/code&gt; is a little more&amp;nbsp;involved:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;RewriteWatch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;astor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;TreeWalk&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="fm"&gt;__init__&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;astor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;TreeWalk&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="fm"&gt;__init__&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;id_counter&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;next_call&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;False&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;post_Name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;

This was a project I championed, and I wanted to offer some context on&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Email Tabs is a browser add-on that makes it easier to compose an email message from your tabs/pages. The &lt;a href="https://testpilot.firefox.com/experiments/email-tabs"&gt;experiment page&lt;/a&gt; describes how it works, but to summarize it from a technical point of&amp;nbsp;view:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You choose some&amp;nbsp;tabs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The add-on gets the best title and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;URL&lt;/span&gt; from the tab(s), makes a screenshot, and uses &lt;a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/firefox/reader-view/"&gt;reader view&lt;/a&gt; to get simplified content from the&amp;nbsp;tab&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It opens a email compose&amp;nbsp;page&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It asks you what you want your email to look like (links, entire articles,&amp;nbsp;screenshots)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It injects the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HTML&lt;/span&gt; (somewhat brutally) into the email composition&amp;nbsp;window&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When the email is sent, if offers to close the compose window or all the tabs you&amp;#8217;ve&amp;nbsp;sent&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s not fancy engineering. It&amp;#8217;s just-make-it-work engineering. It does not propose a new standard for composing &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HTML&lt;/span&gt; emails. It doesn&amp;#8217;t pay attention to your existing mail settings. It does not push forward the state of the art. It has no mobile component. Notably, no one in Mozilla ever asked us to make this thing. And yet I really like this add-on, and so I feel a need to explain&amp;nbsp;why.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;User Research&amp;nbsp;origins&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A long time ago &lt;a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/ux/2015/02/save-share-revisit/"&gt;Mozilla did research into Save/Share/Revisit&lt;/a&gt;. The research was based on interviews, journals, and directly watching people do work on their&amp;nbsp;computers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results should not be surprising, but it was important to actually have them documented and backed up by&amp;nbsp;research:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;People use simple&amp;nbsp;techniques&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Everyone claims to be happy with their current&amp;nbsp;processes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Everyone used multiple tools that typically fed into each&amp;nbsp;other&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Those processes might seem complicated and inefficient to me, but didn&amp;#8217;t to&amp;nbsp;them&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;People said they &lt;em&gt;might&lt;/em&gt; be open to improvements in specific&amp;nbsp;steps&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;People were not interested in revamping their overall&amp;nbsp;processes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some techniques were particularly&amp;nbsp;popular:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Screenshots&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;URLs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Email&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Texting&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bookmarks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://testpilot.firefox.com/experiments/email-tabs"&gt;&lt;img style="float: right; width: 300px; height: auto" src="/media/email-tabs-2.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not everyone used all of these, but they were all&amp;nbsp;popular.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research made me change a page-freezing/saving tool (Page Shot) into what is now &lt;a href="https://screenshots.firefox.com/"&gt;Firefox Screenshots&lt;/a&gt; (I didn&amp;#8217;t intend to lose the freezing functionality along the way, but things happen when you&amp;nbsp;ship).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if the research was fairly clear, it wasn&amp;#8217;t prescriptive, and life moved on. But it sat in the back of my head, both email and the &lt;a href="http://www.ianbicking.org/blog/2018/02/web-small-composable-tools.html"&gt;general question of workflows&lt;/a&gt;. And once I was doing less work on Screenshots I felt compelled to come back to it. Email stuck out, both because of how ubiquitous it was, and how little anyone cared about it. It seemed easy to improve&amp;nbsp;on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Email is also multipurpose. People will apologetically talk about emailing themselves something in order to save it, even though everyone does it. It can be a note for the future, something to archive for later, a message, a question, an &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FYI&lt;/span&gt;. One of the features of Email Tabs that I&amp;#8217;m fond of is the ability to send a set of tabs, and then close those same tabs. Have a set of tabs that represent something you don&amp;#8217;t want to forget, but don&amp;#8217;t want to use right now? Send it to yourself. And unlike structured storage (like a bookmark folder), you can describe as much as you want about your next steps in the email&amp;nbsp;itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Choosing to integrate with&amp;nbsp;webmail&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The obvious solution is to make something that emails out a page. A little web service perhaps, and you give it a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;URL&lt;/span&gt; and it fetches it, and then something that forwards the current &lt;span class="caps"&gt;URL&lt;/span&gt; to that&amp;nbsp;service&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What seems simple becomes hard pretty quickly. Of course you have to fetch the page, and render it, and worry about JavaScript, and so on. But even if you skip that, then what email address will it come from? Do you integrate with a contact list? Make your own? How do you let people add a little note? A note per tab? Do you save a&amp;nbsp;record?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prepopulating an email composition answers a ton of&amp;nbsp;questions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All the mail&amp;nbsp;infrastructure&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;From addresses, email verification, selecting your address,&amp;nbsp;etc&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To field, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CC&lt;/span&gt;, address&amp;nbsp;book&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The editable body gives the user control and the ability to explain why they are sending&amp;nbsp;something&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It&amp;#8217;s very transparent to the user what they are sending, and they confirm it by hitting&amp;nbsp;Send&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since then I&amp;#8217;ve come to appreciate the power of editable documents. Again it should be obvious, but there&amp;#8217;s this draw any programmer will feel towards structured data and read-only representations of that data. The open world of an email body is refreshingly&amp;nbsp;unconstrained.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Email providers &lt;span class="amp"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; broken&amp;nbsp;browsers&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One downside to this integration is that we are shipping with only Gmail support. That covers &lt;a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/547531/e-mail-provider-ranking-consumer-usa-age/"&gt;most people&lt;/a&gt;, but it feels&amp;nbsp;wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is an experiment, so keep it simple, right? And that was the plan until people from marketing kept asking over and over for us to support other clients and we thought: if they care so much maybe they are&amp;nbsp;right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We didn&amp;#8217;t get support for other providers ready for launch, but we did get a good start on it. Along the way I saw that &lt;a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1494105"&gt;Yahoo Mail is broken&lt;/a&gt; and Outlook isn&amp;#8217;t supported at all in Firefox (and the &lt;a href="https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/change-program-used-open-email-links"&gt;instructions&lt;/a&gt; point to a pretty unhelpful &lt;a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/search/?q=webmail"&gt;addons.mozilla.org search&lt;/a&gt;). That&amp;#8217;s millions of users who aren&amp;#8217;t getting a good&amp;nbsp;experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Growing Firefox is a really hard problem. Of course Mozilla has also studied this quite a bit, and one of the strongest conclusions is that people change their browser when their browser breaks. People aren&amp;#8217;t out there looking for something better, everyone has better things to do than think about their web browser. But if things don&amp;#8217;t work people go&amp;nbsp;searching.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what does broken really mean? I suspect if we looked more closely we might be surprised. The simple answer: something is broken if it doesn&amp;#8217;t act the way it should. But what &amp;#8220;should&amp;#8221; something do? If you click a link and Mail.app opens up, and you don&amp;#8217;t use Mail.app, that&amp;#8217;s broken. To Mozilla developers, if Mail.app is your registered default mail provider, then it &amp;#8220;should&amp;#8221; open up. Who&amp;#8217;s&amp;nbsp;right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Email Tabs doesn&amp;#8217;t offer particular insight into this, but I do like that we&amp;#8217;ve created something with the purpose of enabling a &lt;em&gt;successful workflow&lt;/em&gt;. Nothing is built to a spec, or to a standard, it&amp;#8217;s only built to work. I think that process is itself&amp;nbsp;revealing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Listening to the&amp;nbsp;research&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Research requires interpretation. We asked questions about saving, sharing, and revisiting content, and we got back answers on those topics. Were those the right questions to ask? They seem pretty good, but there&amp;#8217;s other pretty good questions that will lead to very different answers. What makes you worried when you use the web? What do you want from a browser? What do you think about Firefox? What do you use a browser for? What are you doing when you switch from a phone to a desktop browser? We&amp;#8217;ve asked all these questions, and they point to different&amp;nbsp;answers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And somewhere in there you have to find an intersection between what you hear in the research and what you know how to do. There&amp;#8217;s no right answer. But there is something different when you &lt;strong&gt;start from&lt;/strong&gt; the user research, instead of &lt;strong&gt;using&lt;/strong&gt; the user research. There&amp;#8217;s a different sort of honesty to the conclusions, and I hope that comes through in the&amp;nbsp;product.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know what Email Tabs isn&amp;#8217;t: it&amp;#8217;s not part of any strategy. It&amp;#8217;s not part of any kind of play for anything. There&amp;#8217;s no ulterior motives. There&amp;#8217;s no income potential. This makes its future very hazy. And it won&amp;#8217;t be a blow-up success. It is merely useful. But I like it, and I hope we do&amp;nbsp;more.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="mozilla"></category></entry><entry><title>My Lunch With A White Supremacist</title><link href="https://ianbicking.org/blog/2018/04/my-lunch-with-a-white-supremacist.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2018-04-23T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2018-04-23T00:00:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Ian Bicking</name></author><id>tag:ianbicking.org,2018-04-23:/blog/2018/04/my-lunch-with-a-white-supremacist.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;About ten years ago I got a call out of the blue from Soren.

&lt;p&gt;Soren had come upon a post of mine …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;About ten years ago I got a call out of the blue from Soren.  I&amp;#8217;d always published my phone number on my website, and it&amp;#8217;s only been used a handful of times.  Hardly anyone wants to actually &lt;em&gt;call&lt;/em&gt; another&amp;nbsp;person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Soren had come upon a post of mine about Oberon, an educational object-oriented operating system and programming language.  I had used it briefly in school and had a fondness for some of its more novel ideas – but it was obscure and he was excited to find another person in Chicago who was interested in it.  He bent my ear about what he was working on.  It wasn&amp;#8217;t really my thing but he seemed excited and starved for some feedback so I chatted for a&amp;nbsp;while.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I suggested we meet at a local Linux Users Group, which was really just a couple regulars talking shit at a local diner.  He showed up late, having come on the bus, and hauling his desktop computer, monitor, and keyboard.  He was abrupt with the waitress as he tried to find an outlet he could use and we all relocated to another part of the diner.  There was lots of eye rolling from the other guys, like &lt;em&gt;what a weirdo&lt;/em&gt;, which was a reasonable assessment but an unfair reaction, as we were all weird and awkward.  I was rooting for him, but no one really got what he was trying to&amp;nbsp;show.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was an exceptionally cold night and I gave him a ride home.  I drove a junker without heat, but even that is more dignified than taking the bus.  He invited me into his house as there was more he wanted to tell me about what he was doing.  I don&amp;#8217;t know what I expected, but it wasn&amp;#8217;t domestic life – two little blond shirtless children, a hippy aesthetic of mason jars and clutter and strange-smelling foods.  His wife seemed exasperated to have an unexpected visitor, but I sensed Soren was a couple years underwater in terms of marital exasperation.  We sat on the floor of the bedroom and Soren described what he was working on in greater&amp;nbsp;detail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m not particularly interested in graphics, but I thought what he was doing was interesting.  He&amp;#8217;d written a kind of real-time object-oriented raytracer.  As a ray entered an object the object itself took over control of the next phase of raytracing.  It might hold sub-objects, or it might have a it&amp;#8217;s own algorithm to determine what the ray would hit, or its own sense of detail.  He told me about how he&amp;#8217;d corresponded with people in the industry, who thought what he was doing was new and interesting, but nothing really came of it.  I suspected they were nodding and agreeing in the same dismissive way that I myself nodded in&amp;nbsp;agreement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;#8217;t see Soren again for some time.  A couple years later we got together for coffee, though he would only drink unsweetened cocoa.  He told me he was on a zero-carb diet, forcing his brain to fuel itself through ketones instead of glucose.  It kept him calm and let him focus, a fairly extreme response to what he implicitly acknowledged was a serious issue for&amp;nbsp;him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Soren clearly saw himself as a misunderstood genius.  Misunderstood by his peers.  Deliberately using obscure technologies which he felt both gave him an edge, and which made his work inaccessible.  Holding on to a grand idea which he imagined could be tremendously important, if only someone could see the potential in what he was&amp;nbsp;doing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a while the topic of politics came up. &amp;#8220;Oh, you wouldn&amp;#8217;t like my politics&amp;#8221; he told me. I thought maybe he was some sort of over-the-top libertarian, or had odd religious views, maybe an anarchist, maybe it was weird or he was just shy. So I encouraged him to go ahead, whatever it is would probably be&amp;nbsp;interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then, pretty quick, there we were: if everyone has persecuted the Jews forever, then it&amp;#8217;s probably them, not us, don&amp;#8217;t you think? And who are your people? You should put them ahead of everyone else, shouldn&amp;#8217;t you? Your family of course, but after family then race: an obligation to your ancestry. And don&amp;#8217;t we deserve to have a homeland of our own? Everyone else has a homeland, and all we&amp;#8217;re asking for is the same thing. Where does civilization come from? Who is its&amp;nbsp;protector?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of his ideas were strictly tribal. Many were based on a survival-of-the-fittest notion, which felt like an intellectual veneer on tribalism. Some ideas were apocalyptic&amp;#8230; he didn&amp;#8217;t want a race war, but he was pretty sure it was&amp;nbsp;coming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I guess I didn&amp;#8217;t take these things to seriously at the time. His beliefs were offensive, to be sure, but in a kind of sad and pathetic way. I debated him at the time – not on the details of his belief, but on the axioms that underlie those beliefs. What&amp;#8217;s the motivation for splitting people up this particular way? Is the world really so zero-sum? Aren&amp;#8217;t our lives larger than race? He had his answers&amp;#8230; and he had a lot of answers, he was clearly excited to talk about these&amp;nbsp;things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before we left I sensed a kind of desperate regret in Soren. He wished he hadn&amp;#8217;t brought this up. First it made him talk faster and more wide-ranging, like we could somehow reach consensus on some other topic and put aside his explicit racism. And then&amp;#8230; well, you can&amp;#8217;t unsay things. We said goodbye, not see you&amp;nbsp;later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we were leaving I told him about my nephew, who was black, and who I loved very dearly, and who was my family. I hadn&amp;#8217;t mentioned him before, it felt too personal, and perhaps safer or more comfortable to talk abstractly instead of personally; I would not be as reluctant now. Then we both just took a deep breath and walked our different directions. We did not speak&amp;nbsp;again.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="misc"></category></entry></feed>
