        <div class="entry-content"><p>After three and a half years at <a class="reference external" href="http://openplans.org">The Open Planning Project</a>, my time there is&nbsp;done.</p>
<p>For a while <span class="caps">TOPP</span> has been trying to find itself, to determine what it is that it can do best, and how to do that.  I think <span class="caps">TOPP</span> has finally started really figuring that out, focusing on civic participation, revisiting &#8220;planning&#8221;, and though it&#8217;s not fully developed there seems to be a strong potential for <span class="caps">TOPP</span> to serve as a point of collaboration for other more ad hoc open source government efforts: government workers and volunteers can provide substantial and well-informed development efforts, but the long-term shepherding of a project is difficult, and <span class="caps">TOPP</span> has the potential to provide that kind of long-term neutral guidance.  At the same time, communities of people have been developing around these issues; people have gotten past simply calling for government to be inclusive or transparent and have started to do the real work of making that&nbsp;happen.</p>
<p>But&#8230; unfortunately I won&#8217;t be able to figure out their next steps with them.  Mark Gorton has been very generous in his support of <span class="caps">TOPP</span>, and helped us get started.  But while he has been patient, and even at times seemingly immune from the economic trends&#8230; well, he&#8217;s not immune, and he has had to cut back his support for <span class="caps">TOPP</span> before we were able to become self-sufficient.  And so there have been layoffs, myself among&nbsp;them.</p>
<p>I suspect what I&#8217;ll do next will have a very different focus.  This feels a bit weird, a kind of lost identity.  Overall I&#8217;m feeling pretty optimistic about finding something new and interesting to do, but I&#8217;m still a bit melancholy about leaving things behind.  That <span class="caps">TOPP</span> and the people I&#8217;ve worked with are far away in New York makes it feel like more of a loss because I don&#8217;t know when I&#8217;ll be back next.  But onward and upward!  Now to find out what is&nbsp;next&#8230;</p>
