            </h1>
        </header>

        <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve been looking at <a class="reference external" href="https://mozillalabs.com/weave/">Weave</a> some lately.  The large-print summary on the page is <em>Synchronize Your Firefox Experience Across Desktop and Mobile</em>.  Straight forward&nbsp;enough.</p>
<p>Years and years ago I stopped really using bookmarks.  You lose them moving from machine to machine (which Weave could help), but mostly I stopped using them because it was too hard to (a) identify interesting content and place it into a taxonomy and (b) predict what I would later be interested in.  If I wanted to refer to something I&#8217;d seen before there&#8217;s a good chance I wouldn&#8217;t have saved it, while my bookmarks would be flooded with things that time would show were of transient&nbsp;interest.</p>
<p>So&#8230; synchronizing bookmarks, eh.  Saved form data and logins?  Sure, that&#8217;s handy.  It would make browsing on multiple machines <em>nicer</em>.  But it feels more like a handy&nbsp;tweak.</p>
<p>All my <em>really</em> useful data is kept on servers, categorized and protected by a user account.  Why is that?  Well, of course, where else would you keep it?  In cookies?&nbsp;Ha!</p>
<p>Why not in cookies?  So many reasons&#8230; because cookies are opaque and can&#8217;t hold much data, can&#8217;t be exchanged, and probably worst of all they just disappear&nbsp;randomly.</p>
<p>What if cookies weren&#8217;t so impossibly lame for holding important data?  Suddenly sync seems much more interesting.  Instead of storing documents and data on a website, the website could put all that data right into your browser.  And conveniently <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DOM_storage"><span class="caps">HTML</span> 5 has an <span class="caps">API</span> for that</a>.  Everyone thinks about that <span class="caps">API</span> as a way of handling off-line caching, because while it handles many problems with cookies it doesn&#8217;t handle the problem of data disappearing as you move between computers and browser.  That&#8217;s where Weave synchronization could change things.  I don&#8217;t think this technique is something appropriate for every app (maybe not most apps), but it could allow a new class of&nbsp;applications.</p>
<p>Advantages: web development and scaling becomes easy.  If you store data in the browser scaling is almost free; serving static pages is a Solved Problem.  Development is easier because development and deployment of <span class="caps">HTML</span> and Javascript is pretty easy.  Forking is easy &#8212; just copy all the resources.  So long as you don&#8217;t hardcode absolute links into your Javascript, you can even just save from the browser and get a working local copy of the&nbsp;application.</p>
<p>Disadvantages: another silo.  You might complain about Facebook keeping everyone&#8217;s data, but the data in Facebook is <em>still</em> more transparent than data held in files or locally with a browser.  Let&#8217;s say you create a word processor that uses local storage for all its documents.  If you stored that document online sharing and collaboration would be really easy; but with it stored locally the act of sharing is not as automatic, and collaboration is <em>very hard</em>.  Sure, the &#8220;user&#8221; is in &#8220;control&#8221; of their data, but that would be more true on paper than in practice.  Building collaboration on top of local storage is hard, and without that&#8230; maybe it&#8217;s not that&nbsp;interesting?</p>
<p>Anyway, there is an interesting (but maybe Much Too Hard) problem in there.  (<span class="caps">DVCS</span> in the&nbsp;browser?)</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: in <a class="reference external" href="http://www.azarask.in/blog/post/you-centric-a-sketch-of-the-future-of-browsers/">this video</a> Aza talks about just what I talk about here.  A few months ago.  The Weave APIs also allude to things like this, including collaboration.  So&#8230; they are on&nbsp;it!</p>
