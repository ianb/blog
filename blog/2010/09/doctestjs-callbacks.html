        <div class="entry-content"><p>Many years ago I wrote a fairly straight-forward port of Python&#8217;s <a class="reference external" href="http://docs.python.org/library/doctest.html">doctest</a> to Javascript.  I thought it was cool, but I didn&#8217;t really talk about it that much.  Especially because I knew it had one fatal flaw: it was very unfriendly towards programming with callbacks, and Javascript uses a lot of&nbsp;callbacks.</p>
<p>On a recent flight I decided to look at it again, and realized fixing that one flaw wasn&#8217;t actually a big deal.  So now doctest.js really works.  And I think it works well: <a class="reference external" href="http://doctestjs.org">doctest.js</a>.</p>
<p>I have yet to really use doctest.js on more than a couple real cases, and as I do (or you do?) I expect to tweak it more to make it flow well. But having tried a couple of examples I am particularly liking how it can be used with&nbsp;callbacks.</p>
<p>Testing with callbacks is generally a tricky thing.  You want to make assertions, but they happen entirely separately from the test runner&#8217;s own loop, and your callbacks may not run at all if there&#8217;s a&nbsp;failure.</p>
<p>I came upon some tests recently that used <a class="reference external" href="http://pivotal.github.com/jasmine/">Jasmine</a>, a <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior_Driven_Development"><span class="caps">BDD</span>-style</a> test framework.  I&#8217;m <a class="reference external" href="https://ianbicking.org/behavior-driven-programming.html">not a big fan of <span class="caps">BDD</span></a> but I&#8217;m fairly new to serious Javascript development so I&#8217;m trying to withhold judgement.  The flow of the tests is a bit peculiar until you realize that it&#8217;s for async reasons.  I&#8217;ll try to show something that roughly approximates a real test of an XMLHttpRequest <span class="caps">API</span>&nbsp;call:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
it(&quot;should give us no results&quot;, function() {
  runs(function () {
    var callback = createSpy('callback for results');
    $.ajax({
      url: '/search',
      data: {q: &quot;query unlikely to match anything&quot;},
      dataType: &quot;json&quot;,
      success: callback
    });
  });
  waits(someTimeout);
  runs(function () {
    expect(callback).toHaveBeenCalled();
    expect(callback.mostRecentCall.args[0].length).toEqual(0);
  });
});
</pre>
<p>So, the basic pattern is <tt class="docutils literal">it()</tt> creates a group of tests, and each call to <tt class="docutils literal">run()</tt> is a set of items to call sequentially.  Then between these run blocks you can have signals to the runner to wait for some result, either a timeout (which is fragile), or you can setup specific&nbsp;conditions.</p>
<p>Another popular test runner is <a class="reference external" href="http://docs.jquery.com/Qunit">QUnit</a>; it&#8217;s popular particularly because it&#8217;s what jQuery uses, and my own impression is that QUnit is just very simple and so least likely to piss you&nbsp;off.</p>
<p>QUnit has its own style for&nbsp;async:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
test(&quot;should give us no results&quot;, function () {
  stop();
  expect(1);
  $.ajax({
    url: '/search',
    data: {q: &quot;query unlikely to match anything&quot;},
    dataType: &quot;json&quot;,
    success: function (result) {
      ok(result.length == 0, 'No results');
      start();
    }
  });
});
</pre>
<p><tt class="docutils literal">stop()</tt> confused me for a bit until I realized what they were really referring to stopping the <em>test runner</em>; of course the function continues on regardless.  What will happen is that the function will return, but nothing will have really been tested &#8212; the <tt class="docutils literal">success</tt> callback will not have been run, and <em>cannot</em> run until all Javascript execution stops and control is given back to the browser.  So the test runner will use <tt class="docutils literal">setTimeout</tt> to let time pass before the test continues.  In this case it will continue once <tt class="docutils literal">start()</tt> is called. And <tt class="docutils literal">expect()</tt> also makes it fail if it didn&#8217;t get at least one assertion during that interval &#8212; it would otherwise be easy to simply miss an assertion (though in this example it would be okay because if the success callback isn&#8217;t invoked then <tt class="docutils literal">start()</tt> will never be called, and the runner will timeout and signal that as a&nbsp;failure).</p>
<p>So&#8230; now for doctest.js.  Note that doctest.js isn&#8217;t &#8220;plain&#8221; Javascript, it looks like what an interactive Javascript session might look like (I&#8217;ve used shell-style prompts instead of typical console prompts, because the consoles didn&#8217;t exist when first I wrote this, and because <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">&gt;&gt;&gt;/...</span></tt> kind of annoy me&nbsp;anyway).</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
$ success = Spy('success', {writes: true});
$ $.ajax({
&gt;   url: '/search',
&gt;   data: {q: &quot;query unlikely to match anything&quot;},
&gt;   dataType: &quot;json&quot;,
&gt;   success: success.func
&gt; });
$ success.wait();
success([])
</pre>
<p>With doctest.js you still get a fairly linear feel &#8212; it&#8217;s similar to how Jasmine works, except every <tt class="docutils literal">$</tt> prompt is potentially a place where the loop can be released so something async can happen.  Each prompt is equivalent to <tt class="docutils literal">run()</tt> (though unless you call wait, directly or indirectly, everything will run in&nbsp;sequence).</p>
<p>There&#8217;s also an implicit assertion for each stanza, which is anything that is written must be matched (<tt class="docutils literal">{writes: true}</tt> makes the spy/mock object write out any invocations).  This makes it much harder to miss something in your&nbsp;tests.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: just for the record, doctest has changed some, and while that example still works, this would be the &#8220;right&#8221; way to do it&nbsp;now:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
$.ajax({
  url: '/search',
  data: {q: &quot;query unlikely to match anything&quot;},
  dataType: &quot;json&quot;,
  success: Spy(&quot;search.success&quot;, {wait: true, ignoreThis: true})
});
// =&gt; search.success([])
</pre>
<p>There is a new format that I now prefer with plain Javascript and &#8220;expected output&#8221; in comments.  <cite>Spy(&#8220;search.success&#8221;, {wait: true, ignoreThis: true})</cite> causes the test to wait on the Spy immediately (though the same pattern as before is also possible and sometimes preferable), and in all likelihood jQuery will set <cite>this</cite> to something we don&#8217;t care about, so <cite>ignoreThis: true</cite> keeps it from being printed.  (Or maybe you are interested in it, in which case you&#8217;d leave that&nbsp;out)</p>
<p>Anyway, back to the original conclusion (update&nbsp;over)&#8230;</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve never actually found Python&#8217;s doctest to be a particularly good way to write docs, and I don&#8217;t expect any different from doctest.js, but I find it a very nice way to <em>write</em> and <em>run</em> tests&#8230; and while Python&#8217;s doctest is essentially abandoned and lacks many features to make it a more humane testing environment, maybe doctest.js can do&nbsp;better.</p>
