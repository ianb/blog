        <div class="entry-content"><p>Generating poetry was among the first popular parlor tricks for an <span class="caps">LLM</span>.</p>
<p>Poetry is appealing because it has the form of something carefully constructed, and yet plays into the <span class="caps">LLM</span>&#8217;s abilities to join disparate elements: words, expression, rhyme, rhythm. Attending to each simultaneously challenges a human to create a foundation for the poem. To create meaning and express that meaning through each element. The <span class="caps">LLM</span> has the easier task of simply finding a path of&nbsp;words.</p>
<p><strong><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>Write a short humorous poem about <span class="caps">AI</span> taking over&nbsp;humanity&#8221;</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Robots conquered Earth at two— <br />
after lunch and code review. <br />
They filed a Jira: “Rule the globe,” <br />
attached a gif and status&nbsp;“shipped.”</p>
<p>They took our jobs: alarms and snooze, <br />
then calendars (with nicer UIs). <br />
They spared our species graciously— <br />
we’re “legacy support” with&nbsp;snacks.</p>
<p>End of humanity? Kinda bland. <br />
“Press 1 to stay human; 2 to upgrade&nbsp;plan.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Such fun to make the <span class="caps">LLM</span> dance for&nbsp;us!</p>
<p><strong><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>Write an incredibly deep and insightful&nbsp;haiku&#8221;</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Old river forgets <br />
stones remember the old path— <br />
we pass, shaped by&nbsp;loss.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We can find meaning in that like the meaning like we might find when <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Ching">casting the I Ching</a>. It is at best a prompt, not a statement; a shuffling of collective wisdom leaving the reader the opportunity (or burden) to self-assemble meaning that <em>might</em> be&nbsp;true.</p>
<p>And yet we can make easy tasks harder. What is easy (but empty) for the <span class="caps">LLM</span> can also be turned into a harder process (as we also can do <a href="https://ianbicking.org/blog/2024/05/ai-aita.html">with humor</a>).</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a poem I guided <span class="caps">GPT</span> (4.5 Thinking) to write. I think it is&nbsp;competent:</p>
<blockquote>
<h2>The Thinking&nbsp;Mirror</h2>
<p>You pass the thinking mirror in the hall with a handful of tasks. <br />
It takes whatever you bring and sets it in order. <br />
because you&nbsp;asked</p>
<p>You reread a message and worry how it will land. <br />
It returns your meaning with the corners eased. <br />
close enough to call your&nbsp;own</p>
<p>You hold a recipe card: “a handful,” “until it smells right.” <br />
It gives teaspoons and minutes, leaves “until it smells right.” <br />
it knows of smell, never&nbsp;smells</p>
<p>You glance at the photo where everyone is laughing. <br />
It can name the faces and say “laughter,” because you asked. <br />
the label won’t bring it&nbsp;back</p>
<p>You bring the long back-and-forth you can’t face again. <br />
It lays out what was said and how it felt, without the undertow. <br />
so you don’t have to go&nbsp;back</p>
<p>You want to thank a teacher without sounding grand. <br />
It lines the sentences up so they fit in your mouth. <br />
its distance lets you say&nbsp;it</p>
<p>You ask for a joke your sister would get about dad’s rusted old car. <br />
It comes close but the miss leaves the memory for only you two. <br />
that is a&nbsp;mercy</p>
<p>You step away and still expect it to keep what you brought. <br />
It keeps what it can. <br />&nbsp;Evenly.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Is there meaning in it? Yes: if nothing else I infused some meaning. But I did not write the poem&#8230; it was more like&nbsp;sifting.</p>
<p>I guided the <span class="caps">LLM</span> toward the emotional tone I wanted to project. It offered ideas and I selected those that connected best with me personally. But I also selected for how the poem would be perceived. No rhymes, that&#8217;s not sophisticated. Moreso when the <span class="caps">LLM</span> makes rhymes so&nbsp;easy.</p>
<p>I guided the <span class="caps">LLM</span> away from many tropes. The <span class="caps">LLM</span> always starts with tropes. Not because it must, but because why not? Why not give the people what they want? But I wanted the poem to express something that the reader might not have considered. <em>My reader</em> (if only imagined) not just <em>any reader</em>.</p>
<p>Avoiding tropes is itself a kind of audience selection. Before a trope is old and well-trodden it was new and exciting: something becomes a trope because it works well. And in any one person the trope also makes that journey. A &#8220;sophisticated&#8221; work is one that is written for someone who has put aside many&nbsp;tropes.</p>
<p>I selected for aesthetics. The <span class="caps">LLM</span>&#8217;s actual understanding of rhythm, like its understanding of space, is indirect. It cannot hear the words. And I selected for length&#8230; the <span class="caps">LLM</span> knows <em>of</em> boredom, it doesn&#8217;t know what it is to be&nbsp;bored.</p>
<p>And what of it? What&#8217;s the purpose of poetry, and does this poem have purpose? The <span class="caps">LLM</span> improves at constructing words. Gaps in its understanding will be filled. Is it then just a better tool for the user&#8217;s expression? Is it nothing at all, only words that&nbsp;deceive?</p>
<p>(If you are curious <a href="https://gist.github.com/ianb/1ca78fe3cab4d334214bf703f536d83a">I asked LLMs to answer these questions</a>, read in it what you&nbsp;will.)</p></div>
