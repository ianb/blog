<p>While I&#8217;m conflicted with the need to find a new job, versus using this break from employment to do things I don&#8217;t otherwise do, one way or another I feel compelled to <em>make something</em>. I started writing down all the things I&#8217;d like to do and now I have to choose one or&nbsp;two.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve embedded <a href="https://web.hypothes.is/">Hypothes.is</a> on this page, which allows inline comments. The controls are floating in the top right of the page. If you have thoughts or resources related to any of these ideas that would be much&nbsp;appreciated.</p>
<p>I also hope some of these ideas will also spark your own imaginations, or, as so often happens to me, brings back to mind some forgotten thought you had meant to&nbsp;pursue.</p>

<h2><span id="job">Job</a></h2>
<h3><span id="find-a-job">Find a&nbsp;job</span></h3>
<p>I’m unemployed. It’s probably a good idea to find a&nbsp;job.</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong> I do need to find a&nbsp;job</p>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong> I usually have a job, and this is a unique moment when I don’t have a&nbsp;job</p>
<h3><span id="figure-out-what-job">Figure out what job I&nbsp;want</span></h3>
<p>I’m unemployed, I should probably figure out what I want to&nbsp;do.</p>
<p>I have a sense of what I want to do, an intersection of a Kind Of Work, and Topics Of&nbsp;Interest.</p>
<p>The Kind Of Work I want to do probably goes under the title of Product Engineer or Research Engineer, but those titles aren’t used universally or particularly well understood. I want to make new things, engaged individually and as part of a team in the ongoing discovery of the product scope. I’d like to be part of a small, diverse, multidisciplinary&nbsp;team.</p>
<p>The Topics Of Interest would&nbsp;include:</p>
<ul>
<li>New user interfaces (including&nbsp;voice)</li>
<li>Edtech with a focus on pedagogy (I’m not as interested in tools supporting bureaucracy of&nbsp;education)</li>
<li>Efforts directed at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_functions">executive&nbsp;function</a></li>
<li>Productivity tools, using the lens of executive function (how can our tools support the executive function of&nbsp;users)</li>
<li>Psychological&nbsp;well-being</li>
<li>I have a technical interest in user-empowering automation&nbsp;tools</li>
<li>I have some <a href="https://www.ianbicking.org/blog/2020/09/a-history-of-projects.html#togetherjs">interest in collaboration&nbsp;tools</a></li>
<li>I do enjoy making development tools, but I’m not sure it’s where I want to go with my&nbsp;career</li>
</ul>
<p>My tasks here are (a) working better at describing my goals, and (b) verifying the goals. What do I really want to do, and what do I want to want to&nbsp;do?</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong> Sets me up to find the right job for&nbsp;me</p>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong> Encourages me to focus on something that might not&nbsp;exist</p>
<h2><span id="web-projects">Web&nbsp;projects</span></h2>
<h3><span id="document-store">Web-based document&nbsp;store</span></h3>
<p>This is a way for applications and personal documents to&nbsp;interact.</p>
<p>This thinking came out of the blog post <a href="http://www.ianbicking.org/blog/2019/01/we-need-open-hosting-platforms.html"><em>We Need Open Hosting Platforms</em></a>.</p>
<p>The idea for the system is really just documents. These could be notes, essays, images, slideshows, or anything that the user authors. It’s not like a filesystem that also contains all kinds of system files and programs that don’t belong and aren’t managed by the user. It <em>is</em> like Google Drive or Dropbox or whatever, but&#8230;&nbsp;open?</p>
<p>It’s also not just named blobs. There’s lots of options for data storage, but it’s just a bunch of bytes and a content-type. Here we want to include other&nbsp;information:</p>
<ul>
<li>How can the document be&nbsp;edited?</li>
<li>How can the document be&nbsp;validated?</li>
<li>Core metadata (e.g.,&nbsp;title)</li>
<li>Extensible metadata (e.g., images have&nbsp;sizes)</li>
<li>How can the document be viewed in&nbsp;public?</li>
<li>How can it be embedded in a web&nbsp;page?</li>
<li>What permissions do other people have? What permissions are&nbsp;possible?</li>
<li>Versioning</li>
<li>Difference&nbsp;display</li>
<li>Copying and&nbsp;linking</li>
<li>Commenting</li>
<li>Collaborative&nbsp;editing</li>
</ul>
<p>The idea here is that there is a framework for creating new kinds of documents, with both general <span class="caps">UI</span> (applicable to any document) and specific <span class="caps">UI</span> for different document&nbsp;types.</p>
<p>Things like “editors” are static bundles of JavaScript and <span class="caps">HTML</span> that obey certain protocols. Once you’ve got a document you might upgrade the editor, but you’ll also have a static copy of the editor in&nbsp;perpetuity.</p>
<p>A goal here is to allow open source developers to create new and interesting interfaces and interactions, without any of the worries of hosting. And users can use them without any worries about being bound to a service, and without placing any burden on the open source developer to maintain any kind of&nbsp;service.</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong> I think the F/<span class="caps">OSS</span> community lacks innovation in the area of user experience, and the lack of a <em>place</em> to do that work is part of it. Thinking critically about documents in the abstract is interesting to&nbsp;me</p>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong> It’s pretty ambitious and I probably don’t have the endurance to make this work really happen. It’s only as good as other people might make&nbsp;it</p>
<h3><span id="automated-exploration">Directed and automated exploratory testing of web&nbsp;applications</span></h3>
<p>I think this would be a great business, and the while the automated testing environment grows year-by-year and new ideas emerge, I still think there’s huge unmet&nbsp;potential.</p>
<p>The web platform is pretty well-defined and sandboxed. At any moment a web application page supports dozens, but not thousands, of reasonable “next operations”: a click, keyboard entry, pasting, dragging, so forth. The protocols that support web debugging also expose much of the metadata you need (the <span class="caps">DOM</span> itself does not). So I believe automated exploration of a web is feasible and&nbsp;useful.</p>
<p>I <em>hate</em> scripted testing, such as Selenium. Most breakage of Selenium tests are because of tooling reasons, and of the remainder most are because of the test detecting intentional and correct changes. This testing punishes positive change instead of enabling&nbsp;change.</p>
<p>The most conservative attempt to fix this test breakage problem is “resilient selectors”, that deal with fragile selectors. This is about the most modest fix I can&nbsp;imagine!</p>
<p>A testing system built close to the web rendering system itself could fix many of the tooling issues, and many of the timing issues. <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/tools/puppeteer">Puppeteer</a> is an improvement&#8230; but it’s a change to the paradigm that I think would really help: instead of testing against a script, the automation framework should just try things with an emphasis on reporting the result instead of comparing the function against a separately-maintained ideal (in the form of a scripted&nbsp;test).</p>
<p>I’ve put a lot of thought into this at Mozilla, though my pitches fell on deaf ears. I’m as optimistic about the idea now as I was many years ago when I started experimenting. But this is a Hard Work idea, not a Have Fun idea. I’m not opposed to hard work, but I’m not going to do it just for the fun, because it isn’t that&nbsp;fun!</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong> I’m personally convinced of the potential, <em>and</em> there are big interesting unanswered&nbsp;questions</p>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong> It’s too big. It’s a developer tool, which is fine, but that&#8217;s probably not what I want to do&nbsp;long-term</p>
<h3><span id="simple-cms">Simple, reflective <span class="caps">CMS</span></span></h3>
<p>Can a <span class="caps">CMS</span> be self-hosting? If you just do it as a file editor with the right sort of authentication, I suppose so. But can a <em>quality</em> <span class="caps">CMS</span> be self-hosting? One that doesn’t invite you to corrupt the app itself, that can be updated, that is extensible without going deep into the code, that handles both the individual bits of content and the aggregate content and the change of content over&nbsp;time.</p>
<p>The <span class="caps">CMS</span> wouldn’t actually be fully self-hosting, I imagine a an underlying storage and rendering layer that is fixed, but not <span class="caps">UI</span>-specific. And it requires some things like a rescue <span class="caps">UI</span> that can’t itself be&nbsp;destroyed.</p>
<p>I’d want to prioritize a small codebase. Just making a featureful <span class="caps">CMS</span> isn’t a useful exercise for&nbsp;me.</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong> I’ve been <a href="https://www.ianbicking.org/blog/2020/09/a-history-of-projects.html#landscaper">thinking about this sort of thing a long&nbsp;time</a></p>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong> I won’t do anything with the result, and the world is full enough of CMSs that no one else will&nbsp;either</p>
<h3><span id="personal-automation">Personal web&nbsp;automation</span></h3>
<p>Most of the <a href="https://www.ianbicking.org/blog/2019/03/firefox-experiments-i-would-have-liked.html">web ideas I’ve had at Mozilla</a> now leave me feeling bored. I’m not trying to be a professional right&nbsp;now.</p>
<p>But web and browser automation is still stuck in my head. Right now can I make something useful for <em>just me</em>? What processes should I be optimizing? What interactions need different controls? How would I want to access those&nbsp;controls?</p>
<p>I might start by simply coding up the extension, and extending it in-place instead of creating any user-programmable&nbsp;tool.</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong> Could be personally useful. Thinking this stuff through is interesting to me, and now is a good time for&nbsp;self-experimentation</p>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong> It’s just diddling around with the same stuff I’ve been doing for a long&nbsp;time</p>
<h4><span id="contribute-to-clipper">Contribute to a web&nbsp;clipper</span></h4>
<p>I came upon <a href="https://github.com/jhlyeung/rumin-web-clipper">Rumin Web Clipper</a> recently (though I haven’t reviewed the current state of the art). It’s the sort of thing I’ve worked on before, and I have a lot of ideas in this area, but I don’t want to be in charge of&nbsp;anything.</p>
<p>I could find a site or two to try to scrape from and submit some PRs. Then the next step is to take some of that data and put it <em>into</em> a site: the other half of structured data&nbsp;extraction.</p>
<p>Data extraction and injection is an interesting lens on&nbsp;automation.</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong> My contributions could be useful even if I don’t stick with it. I can focus more on what I care about and less on&nbsp;infrastructure</p>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong> I might be trying to colonize someone else’s&nbsp;project</p>
<h3><span id="remaking-hotdish">Remake Hotdish. Also make&nbsp;bots</span></h3>
<p>One idea I didn’t get to with <a href="https://www.ianbicking.org/blog/2020/09/a-history-of-projects.html#togetherjs">TogetherJS</a> was <a href="https://www.ianbicking.org/blog/2014/02/collaboration-as-a-skeuomorphism-for-agents.html">Collaboration as a Skeuomorphism for Agents</a>: using collaboration the mechanism for smart bots to act on your&nbsp;behalf.</p>
<p>Also all of <a href="https://www.ianbicking.org/projects.html#hotdish">Hotdish</a> felt like something not-quite-complete. Unfinished work hangs around in my&nbsp;head.</p>
<p>Could I remake Hotdish in a simple way, with an eye to external&nbsp;bots?</p>
<p>Using a Firebase backend would make deployment fairly&nbsp;light.</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong> Gets some old ideas out of my head and into code. I feel better at a lot of the technologies than I was before. I’m really interested in the bot&nbsp;angle</p>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong> Maintaining and using an extension is kind of a pain. I’d need people to actually use it with me. I can always recruit my wife, but will that be sufficient? And Chrome doesn’t have sidebars, which means the primary <span class="caps">UI</span> element I imagine wouldn’t be portable. I’m pretty sure the work would disappear into&nbsp;obscurity</p>
<h3><span id="hypercard">Hypercard-like&nbsp;thing</span></h3>
<p>This idea is perennial for many people. I don’t think we all agree what it&nbsp;means.</p>
<p>To me this is a composition tool that can create simple, content-oriented interactive sites, with some simple core metaphors like buttons/links and&nbsp;cards.</p>
<p>The use of slideshow tools in schools make me more confident that this remains an important use case. I really hate that slide decks have become a significant medium in schools, but the positive side is that they are a good medium for short-form multimedia documents. The slide is a valid unit of structure, akin to the paragraph. The composition tools are flexible and don’t privilege text over everything else. It&#8217;s almost an accident that the purported purpose is giving a&nbsp;presentation.</p>
<p>I see aspects of this embedded in newer online educational tools like Flipgrid and Seesaw. They raise the bar, but maybe also prove the&nbsp;point.</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong> Feels of-the-moment. Some of the technology feels familiar. Other parts feel familiar but tedious (I’m not going to write a good drawing tool). Jumping onto someone else’s project might be possible (but&nbsp;whose?)</p>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong> Large scope. Everyone projects different ideas onto Hypercard. Cannot be&nbsp;finished</p>
<h2><span id="kids">For the&nbsp;kids</span></h2>
<h3><span id="wikipedia">Child-focused Wikipedia&nbsp;browser</span></h3>
<p>Recently my father asked me what ever happened to <a href="http://one.laptop.org/"><span class="caps">OLPC</span></a>. I looked it up to be sure – the domain is there! – but mostly the idea has passed. I found <a href="https://medium.com/@mapmeld/if-one-laptop-per-child-started-today-80d105fef1bb">this retrospective about <span class="caps">OLPC</span></a> from 2016 and it got me&nbsp;thinking.</p>
<p>Was <span class="caps">OLPC</span> too focused on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructivism_(philosophy_of_education)">constructivism</a>? That is, the idea of students actively constructing their education. I like constructivism, but now I’m skeptical if it’s actually <em>correct</em>. Also: is it the right role for a computer in these&nbsp;environments?</p>
<p>A computer can also be a font of wisdom, a deliverer of information. Maybe that’s enough. And of course Wikipedia is a nexus for&nbsp;information.</p>
<p>If we just plopped Wikipedia on a kids computer, how well would that work? Certainly it doesn’t work if you are pre-literate, but that’s only one of many&nbsp;problems.</p>
<p>What would it look like to make something that a kid could sit in front of, as their first ever computing experience, and experience Wikipedia? Probably there would be a place for speech output, maybe speech input. Nonlinear presentation of articles might be good. Using <a href="https://simple.wikipedia.org/">simple.wikipedia.org</a> might be useful (though I assume it’s only in English). Returning to and repeating content will be important for&nbsp;kids.</p>
<p>It feels like it would be easy to get started on this, while the final product would be a long&nbsp;journey.</p>
<p>This could turn into a different browsing experience than the traditional web browser. But it is truly browsing, Wikipedia exemplifies the Old Web: linked documents containing information. But the content is more normalized and consistent (including editorially consistent) than the web, making it easier to&nbsp;reimagine.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WikiReader">WikiReader</a> is an example, though not an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1lRI35gKSPA&amp;t=2s">example of much</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong> Interesting to think about. Getting started is easy. I live with some experiment subjects. I think Wikipedia is one of the best things we got&nbsp;going</p>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong> I feel a little under equipped. It doesn’t satisfy my desire to do some technical deep&nbsp;dives</p>
<h3><span id="microworlds">A foundation for a series of microworld&nbsp;environments</span></h3>
<p>Mindstorms introduced the idea of <a href="http://edutechwiki.unige.ch/en/Microworld">Microworlds</a>, but it never went anywhere. Where could it go? Is there an environment that could support many microwords? Would it look like Scratch, Logo, or something different? Or a framework for building&nbsp;environments?</p>
<p>It might be unreasonable to even consider a foundation without first having several actual microworlds. But supporting small domains and ideas is part of the goal, so this isn’t a blocker. For&nbsp;instance:</p>
<ul>
<li>Buzzfeed-style quiz&nbsp;generator</li>
<li>Eliza-style&nbsp;chatbot</li>
<li>Word explorer (e.g., what words are palindromes? What words have 6 letters where the third is&nbsp;T?)</li>
<li>Simple music&nbsp;generation</li>
<li>Cypher&nbsp;building</li>
<li>Math worksheet&nbsp;creator</li>
</ul>
<p>It’s possible that it would be better to design these and not worry so much about the implementation. As long as I’m not implementing maybe there can be more ambitious&nbsp;examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>Projectile&nbsp;physics</li>
<li>Ecology&nbsp;simulation</li>
<li>Map generation,&nbsp;erosion</li>
<li>Equation exploration (explore things like how numbers increase by&nbsp;square/cube/exponent)</li>
<li>Writing&nbsp;cues</li>
<li>Choose your own&nbsp;adventure</li>
<li>Foreign language exploration (what happens when you translate words vs&nbsp;sentences?)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong> I think we’ve leaned in too far to “learn programming” but not nearly enough into “learn with&nbsp;programming”</p>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong> I haven’t taught these things myself, I just noodle around with the kids. I don’t feel pedagogically&nbsp;competent</p>
<h3><span id="jslogo">Jslogo environment / <span class="caps">IDE</span></span></h3>
<p><a href="https://www.calormen.com/jslogo/">This Logo interpreter</a> is a decent generic logo interpreter. (I <a href="https://github.com/inexorabletash/jslogo/pull/70">learned Promises</a> while contributing async support.) But when I use it with my kids it’s kind of awkward, and we always lose our&nbsp;place.</p>
<p>It would be nice to make use of the interpreter in a different&nbsp;environment.</p>
<p>First, I’m thinking less interactive/<span class="caps">REPL</span> and more about creating a full program. Right now the typical program we write is&nbsp;like:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="err">cs</span>

</pre></div>


<p>That is, always start with <code>cs</code> (clear screen) and then a bunch of commands so it can be re-run from the beginning after&nbsp;adjustments.</p>
<p>I imagine making these repeatable code blocks the standard interaction pattern, treating them something like unnamed functions. Then if you want you can name them and compose them as well (<em>without</em> the clear screen of&nbsp;course).</p>
<p>It might be worth <a href="https://escholarship.org/uc/item/1623m1p3">revisiting the history</a> to look for other ideas (or <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23052300">mine some comments</a>).</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong> I know the language and am familiar with the implementation. Block programming has its advantages, but Logo also has affordances for children. The environment is a really big deal and I have an intuition on some improvements, but there’s also lots of active questions. Deploying is fairly easy, so it could exist in the wild even if I don’t pursue it&nbsp;indefinitely</p>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong> Logo is a fairly obscure language. I’ve been impressed with how well the kids do with block programming. Turtles are <span class="caps">OK</span>, but also a little&nbsp;eh</p>
<h3><span id="lo-fi-page-creator">Lo-fi text web page&nbsp;creator</span></h3>
<p>This is something my younger daughter vaguely requested, and makes sense to&nbsp;me.</p>
<p>Imagine an 80s computer or roguelike, where the screen is your canvas and characters are your paint. So only absolute positioning on a strict grid. Emoji are the only graphics. Letters can be sized 1x, 2x, 3x,&nbsp;etc.</p>
<p>I’m not sure if this requires a monospace font, and I’m not sure what the exact spacing of the font would be in that case; does a clean letter aspect ration matter (e.g.,&nbsp;2x1)?</p>
<p>I think there would still be click events and that sort of thing, so you could add dynamicism to the page (that’s the fun part). I tried creating a literal grid and was unhappy with it, so it would still be absolute positioned divs, just with fixed&nbsp;alignment.</p>
<p>This would require some emoji picker, like <a href="https://github.com/elsmr/emoji-pane">emoji-pane</a> or <a href="https://github.com/OneSignal/emoji-picker">emoji-picker</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong> Fun to try out with the kids as they build web pages for themselves (which they are interested in). I think I’d like the aesthetic of it. I see a lot of advantage in simplifying compositional tools for&nbsp;kids</p>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong> Deployment can be annoying. Glitch makes it easy to get a site up, but not <a href="https://support.glitch.com/t/simple-owner-writable-storage/30364/15">easy to build editors</a>, so any <span class="caps">CMS</span> has to be a whole production. Kids might only play with it a little then we all forget&nbsp;it</p>
<h3><span id="computing-home">Can computing feel like it has a sense of space, a&nbsp;home?</span></h3>
<p>When I’ve tried to interrogate my own sense of nostalgia in computing, something I’ve wanted to recapture is the sense of space and a home in your own computer. A hard disk or even a set of floppy disks give this sense of a place, where you acquire and place things, and where you move around. BBSs had similar feelings, even if it was a clubhouse instead of a home. This was part of the early web as well, but now the web is like visiting a public space. I can visit Facebook, Google Drive, or any other social forum, but I’m just a&nbsp;visitor.</p>
<p>I’m especially noticing this while watching kids use iOS and Chrome <span class="caps">OS</span>, where the experience feels particularly generic and&nbsp;impersonal.</p>
<p>I don’t know how to bring back this sense of personal place. I know it’s not flat, reorderable lists. It’s not algorithmically ranked items. Maybe it’s important to be spacial. Or maybe it’s just important that it’s sticky and personally constructed. A place with personal paths,&nbsp;rediscovery.</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong> This is an attribute I’d like to have in things-I-make, and I think there might be general lessons to be learned. So even if I come up with something that doesn’t work well or I abandon, I think I will have learned&nbsp;something</p>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong> I don’t know what I’m looking for or how to know it when I find&nbsp;it</p>
<h3><span id="program-your-parent">Program your parent: a board&nbsp;game</span></h3>
<p>This is similar to <a href="http://www.robotturtles.com/">Robot Turtles</a>, but relies on the parent to be the&nbsp;computer.</p>
<p>Like Robot Turtles the programs are built with cards. Though maybe it would involve more printable and consumable cards (e.g., things you write numbers on, or “functions” that are a page with slots for&nbsp;parameters).</p>
<p>I imagine two possible goals: one is simply to make your parent do silly things. The second is to solve puzzles, both specifically and generally. (Maybe the puzzle prize is to get your parent to do something silly, like you win silly&nbsp;card/routines)</p>
<p>This is going to rely on the parent both faithfully executing programs, and doing it with enough transparency to help their child debug the&nbsp;program.</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong> Fun to do with the kids. Easy to&nbsp;share</p>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong> I don’t want to create yet another puzzle-based beginner programming&nbsp;thing</p>
<h3><span id="scratch-extension">Create a Scratch&nbsp;extension</span></h3>
<p>You can <a href="https://en.scratch-wiki.info/wiki/Scratch_Extension">build extensions to Scratch</a>. Some speech-related extensions would be easy to imagine. There’s also <a href="https://snap.berkeley.edu/">Snap!</a> to&nbsp;consider.</p>
<p>I’ve also wanted an equation block, that doesn’t require dragging a ton of math-related blocks together to make a simple equation like <code>100 - (x / 4)</code>. I bet it wouldn’t be too hard. The fact variable names are free text and editable does make it harder though, not to mention the fundamentally unnamed aspect of many getters. Maybe this is a bad&nbsp;idea.</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong> Without too much work I could make an interesting change to a programming environment my kids&nbsp;enjoy</p>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong> It’s hard to distribute extensions. Probably what I learn won’t be generalizable to anything&nbsp;else</p>
<h2><span id="natural-language">Natural&nbsp;language</span></h2>
<h3><span id="chat-bot-builder">Chat bot&nbsp;builder</span></h3>
<p>I think it would be cool to let the kids write a little chat bot. Wiring it up on the web is really easy (well, easy in&nbsp;Chrome).</p>
<p>I’ve already extracted a <a href="https://github.com/ianb/phrase-matcher">library from Firefox Voice</a> and played around with a site on&nbsp;Glitch.</p>
<p>I want to allow some of the programming to happen as part of the dialog. For instance, if the bot doesn’t respond well, you should be able to say: “you should have said [X]”, and add to the program on the&nbsp;fly.</p>
<p>I’ve had a hard time focusing the kids on question of what kind of entity they’d like to create. Does it have a personality? Does it have a&nbsp;purpose?</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong> I have all the pieces, and it’s stuff I’ve been doing lately. Simple and hopefully&nbsp;fun</p>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong> The kids aren’t as excited about this as I think they should be. Not sure about the phrase matching, but I don’t want to turn this into&nbsp;Dialogflow</p>
<h3><span id="intent-parser-if">Use an intent parser to build a text&nbsp;adventure</span></h3>
<p>I checked out and did some tests with intent parsers while making Firefox Voice, but I never actually seriously used one. If I did use one it would be <a href="https://rasa.com/">Rasa</a>.</p>
<p>Making a text adventure (ahem, writing <em>Interactive Fiction</em>) using an intent parser seems interesting. Parsing always frustrated me as a user, and maybe these new techniques can&nbsp;help.</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong> Fills out my domain knowledge a bit, while also using things I’ve somewhat familiar with. The result should be fun and&nbsp;playful</p>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong> I don’t have a story idea! Publishing something based on Rasa may be hard (since I don’t want to maintain a&nbsp;server)</p>
<h3><span id="voice-news-reader">Voice-activated news&nbsp;reader</span></h3>
<p>One of the concepts from my work in Consumer Voice Products was a voice-activated news reader. It would be a way to browse newsy sites and get articles read to you, with a voice interface to control the read back (“skip”, “summarize”, “expand” etc). The ideal place to do this is on the phone, as a kind of podcast alternative, but deploying on the phone requires lots of boring engineering I’m uninterested&nbsp;in.</p>
<p>So instead I could try making it in the browser. Maybe I could use <a href="https://github.com/castorini/howl">Howl</a> or something based on <a href="https://ai.googleblog.com/2017/08/launching-speech-commands-dataset.html">Speech Commands</a> for voice recognition. Or just leave the mic open for transcription as a prototype phase, though feedback might make that&nbsp;impossible.</p>
<p>“Give me my daily update” is a common home voice assistant feature, but it does nothing for me. I imagine this as something you’d interact with as an alternative to&nbsp;radio.</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong> I don’t think this would require a lot of work to prototype. I think the idea is a good one. It could be an interesting&nbsp;demo</p>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong> I think it will rely on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keyword_spotting">keyword spotting</a> and it’s not feasible for me to collect new words to train models, so my commands will have to rely on what’s already out there. Also maybe this isn’t&nbsp;fun</p>
<h3><span id="mock-language-interface">Mock out a broad natural language&nbsp;interface</span></h3>
<p>What if we did most of our computing using natural language? This is mostly a brainstorming exercise. Take a some typical computer interactions and reimagine them entirely with natural&nbsp;language.</p>
<p>The result probably imagines a refactored experience. Things that are distinct steps now would be combined, while other situations would require conversational or other multi-step interactions. It might imply new things, like named staging locations, or other&nbsp;shortcuts.</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong> I think there’s a certain naiveté to our voice interfaces, but I don’t know what we’d even be trying to get to. Maybe I’d have some more&nbsp;ideas?</p>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong> The result is just… a blog&nbsp;post?</p>
<h3><span id="brain-in-a-jar">Brain-in-a-jar dialog&nbsp;game</span></h3>
<p>The premise: a person has had their consciousness extracted, or at least simulated in a computer. You, a temp/Mechanical Turk, have been hired to make this artificial consciousness feel better. If it realizes it is a robot it will be&nbsp;rebooted.</p>
<p>Technically I’m not sure how to do much of this. But it could be fun to try. Different utterances would increase or decrease the existential skepticism&nbsp;points.</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong> Learn some more <span class="caps">NLP</span>. Play around with fictional emotional ideas. Maybe I can share a rough playable&nbsp;game</p>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong> I’m not sure how to drive a useful plot forward. There’s a game design aspect that I know nothing&nbsp;about</p>
<h3><span id="interview-chatbot">Interview&nbsp;chatbot</span></h3>
<p>Not a job interview! This chatbot doesn’t pretend to be human, doesn’t even pretend to really talk to you. Instead it interviews you. It asks questions, maybe asks followup questions, and saves the responses. Might operate better over email than chat. Make your own oral&nbsp;history!</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong> I think I would like the result of this. Self-documentation is important. It would be easy to manually (Wizard Of Oz)&nbsp;prototype</p>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong> Most people (including myself) will just try it for a week or two then forget about it, or worse feel guilty for not&nbsp;continuing</p>
<h3><span id="emotional-tamagotchi">Emotional&nbsp;Tamagotchi</span></h3>
<p>Your little entity/bot gets lonely and sad. Instead of feeding it fake food and whatnot, you must feed it emotional support and positive&nbsp;feelings.</p>
<p>Secretly it’s all sent to actual sad people to make them happy. A language transformer covers up the&nbsp;humanity.</p>
<p>Nah, I probably wouldn’t do the second&nbsp;part.</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong> Kind of easy. Maybe involves plugging existing models together. I’m curious what it would feel like to&nbsp;use</p>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong> Easy to hack. Lacks actual emotional&nbsp;core</p>
<h2><span id="programming-languages">Programming&nbsp;languages</span></h2>
<h3><span id="new-programming-syntax">Try to come up with a new category of programming&nbsp;syntax</span></h3>
<p>There’s only a few syntaxes in programming&nbsp;languages:</p>
<ol>
<li>Algol</li>
<li>Lisp</li>
<li>Forth</li>
<li>Smalltalk</li>
<li><span class="caps">APL</span></li>
<li><span class="caps">SQL</span>?</li>
</ol>
<p>People keep revisiting these basic syntaxes, and even then it’s like a power law of popularity. Just out of curiosity, are there other things we could&nbsp;try?</p>
<p><a href="http://www.textfiles.com/bitsavers/pdf/xerox/alto/Smalltalk72_Manual.pdf">Smalltalk-72</a> had some interesting ideas. It was very expansive and inclusive. Smalltalk-76 (which is pretty much what we have today) pulled a small core out of that, but maybe there’s other foundations of syntax to be mined from those&nbsp;ideas?</p>
<p>I would probably just use this as a brainstorming exercise, and then mock up some results and write a blog&nbsp;post.</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong> Pretty simple and finite. Hopefully fun. If I can’t come up with anything, so it&nbsp;goes</p>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong> Just a silly little&nbsp;exercise</p>
<h3><span id="functional-core-notebook">Functional core&nbsp;notebook</span></h3>
<p>Order of execution is a common problem in notebooks, as well as experimentation. Notebooks are often exploratory, and you want to try different versions of functions and&nbsp;processes.</p>
<p>This would be a lot easier with functional and deterministic code. You could memoize results and understand&nbsp;dependencies.</p>
<p>I also feel like lots of the imperative and stateful parts of notebooks are the setup, such as acquiring data. So I imagine a kind of “shell” in the notebook where you do imperative setup and the cells where you reshape data and do&nbsp;calculations.</p>
<p>The name has some similarity to <a href="https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/screencasts/catalog/functional-core-imperative-shell">Functional Core, Imperative Shell</a> and probably some similar motivations, but encodes the idea directly into the tool and&nbsp;languages.</p>
<p>I’m wondering if I could do this with a deterministic subset of Python. Things like “import” are environment setup, and maybe even function definitions, while there’s innards that are&nbsp;deterministic.</p>
<p>It may be <span class="caps">OK</span> for the code to stateful, <em>if</em> the statefulness is part of the analysis. That is, you could have a cell&nbsp;like:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">most_populous_cities</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">[]</span>
<span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">city</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="n">all_cities</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="n">most_populous_cities</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">push</span><span class="p">((</span><span class="n">city</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="err">“</span><span class="n">population</span><span class="err">”</span><span class="p">],</span> <span class="n">city</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="err">“</span><span class="n">name</span><span class="err">”</span><span class="p">]))</span>
<span class="n">most_populous_cities</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">sort</span><span class="p">()</span>
</pre></div>


<p>It both creates a new global variable, <em>and</em> modifies it in place. But if <code>all_cities</code> is the same then the result of this calculation will be the same. You could consider its input to be <code>[all_cities]</code> and its output is an addition to the environment <code>[most_populous_cities]</code>. (Also <code>city</code> is set and almost certainly is not important, but that’s the kind of detail we’d need to figure out. Also it’s not <span class="caps">OK</span> for another cell to modify <code>most_populous_cities</code> – modifications need to create new global&nbsp;variables.)</p>
<p>I think <a href="https://observablehq.com/">Observable</a> has bits of this in its&nbsp;concept?</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong> I’ve <a href="https://www.ianbicking.org/blog/2018/11/viewing-python-execution-source-code-rewriting.html">played with ASTs</a> and found it interesting and productive, and this general concept is one I’ve been thinking about for a long&nbsp;time</p>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong> Do I make a new notebook interface? Maybe… and maybe it’s okay if it’s scrappy, but it’s kind of a&nbsp;distraction</p>
<h3><span id="symbolic-execution">Something with symbolic&nbsp;execution</span></h3>
<p>I’ve never seriously done symbolic execution or even used it. But I’ve found the <a href="https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2019/05/what-weve-built-is-a-computational-language-and-thats-very-important/">Wolfram Language</a> interesting, and find it really interesting as something quite distinct from more formal functional&nbsp;languages.</p>
<p>I guess I should check out <a href="https://github.com/ksluckow/awesome-symbolic-execution">this list</a>, <a href="https://www.sympy.org/en/index.html">SymPy</a>, <a href="https://github.com/bannsec/pySym">pySym</a> (?!?), <a href="https://www.sagemath.org/">Sage</a>, <a href="https://github.com/ExpoSEJS/ExpoSE">ExpoSE</a> (JavaScript), <a href="https://prepack.io/">Prepack</a> (<span class="caps">JS</span> partial evaluation), <a href="https://peval.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">peval</a> (Python partial&nbsp;evaluation).</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong> There’s lots of material to start with, and it’s easy to come up with early experiments. It’s the kind of problem I can sit down and tackle for a day at a&nbsp;time</p>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong> Not very human-centric. Lots of prior art is actually about a kind of speculative execution of binaries for security checking, which I find&nbsp;boring</p>
<h4><span id="reverse-execution">Attempt to reverse&nbsp;execution</span></h4>
<p>Given a return value from a function, what inputs or actions might have led to&nbsp;that?</p>
<p>I presume this is pretty hard, and possibilities explode quickly. But I’d like to understand <em>why</em> it is hard, and the easiest way might be to try until I&nbsp;fail.</p>
<p>This will require new “possibility” objects, and probably kinds of partial evaluation (partial&nbsp;unevaluation?).</p>
<p>Maybe I’d pick a subset of JavaScript (maybe Python) and use the <span class="caps">AST</span>.</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong> I can just jump in and&nbsp;start</p>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong> I know the result is failure! I just don’t know where and&nbsp;when</p>
<h3><span id="partial-evaluation">Partial evaluation as the execution&nbsp;engine</span></h3>
<p>I think this might be what I actually am thinking of when I think of <a href="#symbolic-execution">symbolic execution</a>.</p>
<p>Partial evaluation is taking an expression and evaluating the parts you already know. So if you see&nbsp;this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="c1"># My apologies for this lazily constructed example...</span>
<span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">calculate</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">x</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">y</span><span class="p">):</span>
  <span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">x</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">x</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="mi">10</span>
  <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">y</span>

<span class="nb">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;Answer:&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">calculate</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">10</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">some_func</span><span class="p">()))</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Then you can look at how <code>calculate()</code> is called with one known value (<code>10</code>) and then see that <code>if x:</code> will be true, and so on, reducing it all to <code>print("Answer:", 20)</code>.</p>
<p>There are limitations to how well you can do this in an imperative language. For instance in this case we&#8217;ve optimized away the call to <code>some_func()</code>, and that might not be correct: the function might actually do something important, even if its return value is thrown&nbsp;away.</p>
<p>But this is also a feature: by eliminating <code>some_func()</code> you can simplify the program, or at least find the simpler specific program that lives in the complete&nbsp;program.</p>
<p>A long, long, long time ago I made something called <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080512151939/http://www.colorstudy.com/software/tcl-scheme/"><code>tcl-&gt;scheme</code></a> that was a <span class="caps">TCL</span> interpreter written in functional Scheme, with the idea that if you apply partial evaluation you can compile <span class="caps">TCL</span> into Scheme. This only works to the degree that <span class="caps">TCL</span> doesn&#8217;t use overly dynamic features (like <a href="https://www.tcl.tk/man/tcl8.6/TclCmd/eval.htm">eval</a>), but even if it does you still have a working intepreter to fall back&nbsp;on.</p>
<p>Maybe combined with the <a href="#functional-core-notebook">functional core</a> notebook concept this could create something&nbsp;interesting.</p>
<p>To take this a bit&nbsp;further:</p>
<ol>
<li>The language has to have the ability to be expanded out into expressions. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S-expression">S-Expressions</a> are very appealing, though more eclectic syntaxes aren&#8217;t <em>that</em> much worse. But Python&#8217;s indentation-based syntax is&nbsp;problematic.</li>
<li>All objects need source code representations. It&#8217;s important to me that we can turn all the intermediate forms into actual source code, to see how the source actually evolves. <code>&lt;SomeObject at 0x0292a43e&gt;</code> isn&#8217;t going to&nbsp;work.</li>
<li>But maybe representations can also be richer than&nbsp;text.</li>
<li>It would be nice to track where literals came from, and use that to detect if they are&nbsp;editable.</li>
<li>It would be interesting to include tracking information so you could see why an object became what it&nbsp;is.</li>
<li>There doesn&#8217;t have to be any undefined errors: if you refer to something that doesn&#8217;t exist it could be an as-yet-unspecified input. Or code that hasn&#8217;t been written yet. The system can &#8220;think about&#8221; (partially evaluate!) incomplete&nbsp;code.</li>
<li>Because execution happens opportunistically the language can&#8217;t be imperative, it can&#8217;t be a sequence of things being executed. Technically it <em>could</em>, and partial evaluation systems can take that into account, but the rewritten code is too complex for our&nbsp;purposes.</li>
<li>You can imagine a multiple worlds execution, and doing diffs of the result. If I have three different inputs, and diff the resulting partially evaluated programs, what do I get? If I have two implementations of a function, how do they change the overall execution? This could be an interesting way to think about code&nbsp;changes.</li>
<li>There&#8217;s going to be lots of &#8220;smart&#8221; primitives: routines that are built into the execution engine and know how to execute the source itself. There&#8217;s definitely a powerful and general execution engine (the thing I write), and a much less powerful user-programmable expression&nbsp;engine.</li>
</ol>
<p>I think <a href="http://www.textfiles.com/bitsavers/pdf/xerox/alto/Smalltalk72_Manual.pdf">Smalltalk-72</a> played around with these ideas, and looking into it would be&nbsp;helpful.</p>
<p>The JavaScript parsing and <span class="caps">AST</span>-rewriting ecosystem is healthy, and I think I could use it as a starting&nbsp;point.</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong> I&#8217;ve thought about this a long time, and writing it down makes me excited. This is fun&nbsp;programming</p>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong> I&#8217;m not sure I can get it to be a useful environment (simply because it&#8217;s a lot of work), and if it&#8217;s not useful then I can&#8217;t confirm the utility of the concept&nbsp;itself</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong></p>
<p>I&#8217;ve started on this some, using <a href="https://github.com/benjamn/recast">Recast</a> to operate on JavaScript ASTs. Working in <a href="https://github.com/ianb/partial-language">github/ianb/partial-language</a>.</p>
<p>Right now it&#8217;s stuck to JavaScript syntax, though not necessarily JavaScript semantics. I expect this may be a problem. A series of transformations looks&nbsp;like:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="c1">// Original input, note order of declaration is not important:</span>

<p>It&#8217;s cute, doesn&#8217;t take too much code. I&#8217;m not sure how far it can go. Having more control of the syntax would be nice, for instance substituting <code>func(10)</code> for an inline arrow function is not the best, but there aren&#8217;t block expressions in&nbsp;JavaScript.</p>
<h2><span id="ai"><span class="caps">AI</span></a></h2>
<h3><span id="binocular-vision">Binocular vision and image&nbsp;processing</span></h3>
<p>For some reason <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binocular_vision">binocular vision</a> isn’t a common tool in robots and vision. Different distance-sensing tools like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lidar">Lidar</a> seem more common. Lidar is more expensive, but it creates a concrete depth field. But is a depth field even enough? It seems interesting to actually include visual information and depth information&nbsp;together.</p>
<p>I’m specifically interested in how binocular vision works with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolutional_neural_network">Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)</a>. CNNs are the standard tool in image processing, where you have a neural network where you not only train some kind of detection, but you also have a bunch of “convolutional” layers that are essentially image processors. These typically learn to find edges or other features in the image, by using a “windows” (fixed size squares, 3x3, 5x5 etc, taken from the image) and training matrices that process those windows. (I guess for this case wide windows would make sense, there&#8217;s no need for the windows to be&nbsp;square.)</p>
<p>In a typical setup you pass in a red, blue, and green layer, and you let the training process discover things like the meaning of color. And if color isn’t important then it can learn to just add them all together. Instead of these three layers, you could just pass in six: red-left, blue-left, green-left, red-right, blue-right, green-right. And then the <span class="caps">CNN</span> can learn how to use the differences between those layers to understand its&nbsp;environment.</p>
<p>The first thing I’d have to do is create a binocular camera. There’s some expensive options intended for robots. Unfortunately I can’t fit two <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/camera-module-v2/">Raspberry Pi cameras</a> on a single unit. Maybe I just need two cheap <span class="caps">USB</span> cameras. Or maybe there’s a clever way using mirrors to turn a single camera into a binocular&nbsp;camera?</p>
<p>Next I have to figure out a training process. What am I even training for? One possibility might be to use an ultrasonic distance sensor to get a real distance, and then just train a model to see if it can predict that number from the image. The ultrasonic sensors aren’t very accurate and only see a small cone, so I’m not sure if it’s great training data. But if I train it to make a depth field, and only train to the part of the image that I have a measurement for, will it magically give accurate numbers for the other positions? It would be better if I had a full task in mind to train&nbsp;against.</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong> It’s kind of interesting, it’s nice to think about real physical things instead of just information on the&nbsp;web</p>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong> Figuring out how to get images and ground truth data for training is hard, I don’t have many&nbsp;ideas</p>
<h3><span id="nn-from-scratch">Neural networks from&nbsp;scratch</span></h3>
<p>I took a course that covered neural networks, and it was <span class="caps">OK</span> – it got me to go through a bunch of exercises and covered the material in a somewhat structured way. There’s a huge amount more I could try to do as a practitioner: learn PyTorch, try different architectures, do more data shaping and feature selection, etc. But there’s also the basic theory, some of which I felt pretty comfortable with, but not all. Backpropagation especially: I get that a differentiable algorithm is useful, and in theory how that would lead to backpropagation, but there are <em>so many</em> details that are vague in my&nbsp;mind.</p>
<p>Building a neural network system from scratch seems like a great way to solidify my theoretical understanding, even if I’ll never again work at that level and just use frameworks in any practical&nbsp;setting.</p>
<p>I’ve seen a couple resources on this: <a href="https://nnfs.io/">Neural Networks From Scratch</a>, a more casual <a href="https://victorzhou.com/blog/intro-to-neural-networks/">Machine Learning for Beginners: An Introduction to Neural Networks</a> (with another <a href="https://victorzhou.com/blog/intro-to-rnns/">for RNNs</a> and <a href="https://victorzhou.com/blog/intro-to-cnns-part-1/">CNNs</a>), a similar <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-build-your-own-neural-network-from-scratch-in-python-68998a08e4f6">How to build your own Neural Network from scratch in Python</a>, and <a href="https://enlight.nyc/projects/neural-network">another</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong> I can just follow along with someone else’s instruction. I’m pretty sure what I learn will be useful to&nbsp;me</p>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong> Not directly&nbsp;creative</p>
<h2><span id="not-computing">Not (just)&nbsp;computing</span></h2>
<h3><span id="physical-workspace">Physical workspace&nbsp;optimizations</span></h3>
<p>In most ways my computing behavior has become less optimized and more aligned with broad consumer trends over time. This is a result of (a) not being willing to spend time customizing things, and (b) wanting to experience normal things so I can relate to normal computer&nbsp;users.</p>
<p>But there’s a part of me that thinks I’ve overdone it. Maybe micro-optimization are silly, but they can also be a tool to focus. The awkward in-between experiences in a computer are genuinely dangerous for focus. I feel my mental load is finite, and using it up on stupid window fiddling and such spends down my mental&nbsp;capacity.</p>
<p>I’m interested in what it might look like to customize my physical environment. Things like the <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/professional/blog/look-back-bloomberg-keyboard/">Bloomberg Terminal keyboard</a> are interesting, or <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/comments/be23vc/vintage_newspaper_editing_terminal_keyboard/">an editing keyboard</a> or <a href="https://relivesight.com/projects/433/">what have you</a>.</p>
<p>Minimal keyboards are kind of the style right now (I’m using one myself). But maybe that’s a silly optimization. Lots of stuff on a 101 key keyboard isn’t for me: function keys I don’t use, a number pad I don’t use. Does it actually follow that lots of keys aren’t useful? Or is it that I haven’t put in the time to make sure the keys are useful for <em>me</em>?</p>
<p>It’s pretty easy to just add more <span class="caps">USB</span> devices. I can have multiple keyboards attached, multiple mice and trackpads. I don’t have to assemble a single custom device (which I’ve decided is infeasible), I can just throw things together, apply some labels. Maybe it’ll just be <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CqOtEz6PfA">silly</a> but I don’t&nbsp;know.</p>
<p>One goal would be to use keys for “absolute” controls. As an example instance ⌘-[ moves one tab to the left (very relative), while ⌘-1 moves to the first tab of the active window (somewhat relative). Instead I want a “focus Gmail” key, and my current focus shouldn’t&nbsp;matter.</p>
<p>Obviously there&#8217;s a lot of general physical arrangement to be figured out as&nbsp;well.</p>
<p>These <a href="https://www.1upkeyboards.com/shop/keyboard-kits/macro-pads/sweet-16-macro-pad-black/">16 key kits</a> seem like an interesting macro option. Interesting things <a href="https://www.gboards.ca/">here too</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Progress</strong>: I&#8217;m trying switching back to my old <a href="https://kinesis-ergo.com/shop/advantage2/">Kinesis Advantage keyboard</a>. The actual keyboard is a bit old and smushy and not 100% reliable, so I might have to re-up if I decide I like it. I&#8217;m not sure I do? The movements come back quickly though. Interestingly you can fit the Apple Magic Trackpad in the space between the two hand-wells. I&#8217;m not sure if that&#8217;s actually an&nbsp;improvement.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m trying to make it easier to move between sitting, standing, and using a treadmill. I&#8217;ve had the treadmill a long time, but haven&#8217;t used it that much because it means moving from one workspace to another. This is <span class="caps">OK</span>, but puts my productivity in conflict with healthy body positions. That&#8217;s not a good way to set oneself up to make healthy choices. So instead I&#8217;ve made a platform that can be slid over the treadmill, with a chair on top, and I move that back and forth while everything else stays in&nbsp;place.</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong> I&#8217;ll become an expert hacker! Maybe I can type with a different keyboard for each hand. Cryptic neon-green characters will flow from my&nbsp;screen</p>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong> It makes my environment less portable. I might not like the&nbsp;result</p>
<h3><span id="executive-function">Something involving executive&nbsp;function</span></h3>
<p>This probably starts with study, and leads… somewhere I can’t determine right now. <a href="https://twitter.com/ianbicking/status/1299131871356489731">I&#8217;m just starting to think about these&nbsp;things.</a></p>
<p>I’m very interested in the mental models that underly our&nbsp;action.</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong> I’m pretty sure I could use what I learn in almost anything I do. I’m sure there’s important theory for me to&nbsp;learn</p>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong> This doesn’t satisfy my desire to make. That desire is&nbsp;considerable</p>
<h3><span id="sms-watch"><span class="caps">SMS</span>-based dispatch system for the local neighborhood&nbsp;watch</span></h3>
<p>There’s a <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2020/09/07/we-can-solve-our-own-problems-a-vision-of-minneapolis-without-police">watch/patrol/safety group</a> in my neighborhood. It’s a little unclear how residents can get in contact. I played around with some text automation using <a href="https://www.integromat.com/">Integromat</a> and <a href="https://www.twilio.com/">Twilio</a> and while some parts were quirky, it wasn’t too hard to do, nor very expensive to maintain. Maybe I could set something up for the group using&nbsp;this?</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong> Helps connect me more with the neighborhood. Right now safety is an important political issue, and this particular effort seems concrete and positive. The hard parts are all in working with and designing with these other people that I don’t know&nbsp;well</p>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong> Nothing particularly technically involved. Doesn’t let me do the kid of somewhat reclusive and focused work I’m looking&nbsp;for</p>
<h3><span id="southside-greenway">Freshen up Southside Greenway&nbsp;proposal</span></h3>
<p>Some people made a <a href="https://www.ourstreetsmpls.org/southsidegreenway">pretty involved proposal to turn my street into a greenway</a>. That would be totally incredible, even though it feels outside of the bounds of what we can imagine in this city right now given everything else that is going&nbsp;on.</p>
<p>The proposal has a lot of good work, embedded in a pretty hard to find location. I could make a site and take that content and maybe help keep it alive in the&nbsp;process.</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong> The material is all there, so this feels like there’s a lot of leverage to the&nbsp;work</p>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong> The material is all there&nbsp;already</p>
<h3><span id="correspondence">Long-form slow-paced email correspondence&nbsp;platform</span></h3>
<p>Reading about famous correspondences of the past, I am somewhat jealous. We have social media but it’s a little light on interpersonal communication. Obviously we can just communicate, just do it, but I do think there’s something useful about an understood and agreed-upon structure with some supports and&nbsp;reminders.</p>
<p>I’m thinking about correspondence that is rate-limited to once per week. So if I receive your letter on September 1st, I can send a reply any time but it can’t possibly arrive before September 8th. This is the opposite of texting. Because of these shared expectations the conversation never has to “finish” but it also isn’t left&nbsp;dangling.</p>
<p>This is probably best prototyped with a couple people and no actual&nbsp;automation.</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong> Prototyping would also presumably lead to some interesting correspondences. The whole thing is very&nbsp;simple</p>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong> Well, I do have to find people to prototype it with. What if it turns out to be boring? Or one of us ghosts the other one? Is this a guilt&nbsp;factory?</p>
<h3><span id="game-word">Game&nbsp;world</span></h3>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultima_VI:_The_False_Prophet">Ultima <span class="caps">VI</span></a> really caught my imagination as a child. Mostly because it felt both complex and comprehensible: you could see the implementation, but it still felt&nbsp;alive.</p>
<p>Nostalgia and escapism makes me want to recreate that kind of simple emergence. A little world that can exist without me and yet is by me. Tiny beings with their own tiny internal&nbsp;world.</p>
<p>I’m sure there’s game frameworks that would be a great basis for this, but there’s <em>so many options</em> that I’m a little lost. What abstract level lets me do the parts I am excited about and skip the parts I&#8217;m not interested&nbsp;in?</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong> This has been in my head much longer than any of these other ideas! It feels&nbsp;fun</p>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong> Escapist and it’s unlikely to lead&nbsp;anywhere</p>

<h3><span id="remembrance-agent">Remembrance&nbsp;Agent</span></h3>
<p>I came upon this concept in an <a href="https://www.npr.org/2015/02/13/385793862/computer-or-human-thad">Invisibilia podcast episode</a>, where they talked to Thad Starner about his 90s personal wearable note-taking tool, the <a href="https://alumni.media.mit.edu/~rhodes/Papers/remembrance.html">Remembrance Agent</a>.</p>
<p>The idea of note-taking and retrieval is simple enough, but as presented the tone feels different from other note taking, more stream of consciousness, more about connecting the present self to the past self. Maybe it’s just the word “remembrance” that sticks with&nbsp;me.</p>
<p>I honestly don’t know what I would do in this area. Maybe nothing, but I like <em>thinking</em> about doing&nbsp;something.</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong> Seems&nbsp;cool</p>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong> What am I doing&nbsp;again?</p>
<h3><span id="arcology">Arcology requirements and&nbsp;constraints</span></h3>
<p>You might know <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arcology">arcologies</a> from SimCity. I encountered <a href="https://www.organism.earth/library/document/arcology">Arcology: The City In The Image of Man</a> in my college library’s oversized book section. Or one of Buckminster Fuller’s proposals like the <a href="https://www.historyandheadlines.com/east-st-louis-and-the-old-man-river-project/">Old Man River&#8217;s City project</a>.</p>
<p>It’s an old fantasy and it seems entirely unreasonable – even undesirable – now. But I still wonder… there’s all these visual concepts, but what would it really require in practice? What amount of space or energy is required for the mechanics? What kind of movement and transportation is required? How much intake of material would a community need? What kinds of&nbsp;services?</p>
<p>I guess the result would be a&nbsp;spreadsheet?</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong> Not computers, something different. Fairly accessible research&nbsp;process</p>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong> Not sure what I’d do with the&nbsp;result</p>
<h3><span id="fractals">Play with&nbsp;fractals</span></h3>
<p>What’s the state of the art in fractals these days? And <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaos_theory">chaos theory</a>? These were fun exciting new things in the&nbsp;90s.</p>
<p>While it’s kind of an aside, I came upon <a href="https://blog.scottlogic.com/2019/05/17/webassembly-compiler.html">this tutorial for compiling to <span class="caps">WASM</span></a> that looked interesting. It steps through creating a simple language (tokenizer, parser) and compiling it directly to <span class="caps">WASM</span>. The example language it uses it suitable for rendering the Mandelbrot set (and not a lot else), but extending it only for other fractals would probably be feasible and&nbsp;interesting.</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong> It would be nice to get clearer on <span class="caps">WASM</span>, and fun to do a project around&nbsp;it</p>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong> I could probably just look up some fractal explorers, play with them, and call it a&nbsp;day</p>
<h3><span id="fiction">Write&nbsp;fiction</span></h3>
<p>I’ve twice tried and failed <a href="https://nanowrimo.org/">Nanowrimo</a>. Maybe I should try it again? Fantastical alternate reality or absurdist political&nbsp;thriller?</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong> I do think about this often. Unlike many things here it’s not something I’d satisfy in my professional life. It’s escapist, disconnected from the current&nbsp;moment</p>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong> It’s really big task and has no outward result unless I finished, which is unlikely. Maybe I’m between jobs, but even doing silly projects does move me forward in my career, even if it only clarifies my own feelings towards my work. It’s escapist, disconnected from the current&nbsp;moment</p>
<h3><span id="beliefs">Document my&nbsp;beliefs</span></h3>
<p>I think I believe things, but what are those things anyway? If I write them down maybe I’ll find&nbsp;out.</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong> I think about these issues often, and am constantly trying (and am overwhelmed) to determine what my place is in the world. I’m going to put that effort in regardless, but doing so in a conscious and structured way might at least move me&nbsp;forward</p>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong> Maybe I’m <a href="https://www.theredhandfiles.com/the-lyrics-just-arent-coming/">not ready</a> to decide what I believe, maybe it simply has not yet arrived? Is this indulgent? It would probably not be fun, it would be hard&nbsp;work</p>
<h2><span id="conclusion">Conclusion</span></h2>
<p>Now that I&#8217;ve written all these down I&#8217;m worried I won&#8217;t get through any of them (except hopefully a job). Am I looking to expand my own thinking, my own skills, make something that is fun, or something that has future&nbsp;potential?</p>
