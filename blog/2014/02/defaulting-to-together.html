        </header>

        <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve been working on an experiment, <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/hotdish/">Hotdish</a>, for several weeks now with <a href="http://www.whatthedruck.com/">Aaron Druck</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/gregglind">Gregg Lind</a>.  I&#8217;m really excited about what we&#8217;re doing, and in particular I&#8217;m excited about some of the principles we are bringing to the design.  Hotdish is an experiment in sharing a browser session among a group of peers &#8212; you activate Hotdish on one browser window and everyone in your group sees what you do in that window, and we have tools to interact in the context of that&nbsp;session.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve started the design with the expectation that Hotdish will be used with a group of people you want to be working with, and we expect that you trust this group of people.  We&#8217;re not building this as an internet-wide tool, one where people will be trolling each other, or one where some people will be an order of magnitude more noisy than everyone else. So when we take a regular internet collaboration/cooperation idea and rephrase it in the context of Hotdish we think about how we can change default behaviors to make use of that&nbsp;trust.</p>
<p>Instead of using the tool to restrict people from bothering each other, we want to create a tool that <strong>enables powerful new ways for one person to bother another</strong> in the group.  If that&#8217;s a problem, we expect you to deal with that socially rather than building something into the tool. (<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GtrSn8WwCa4">Use your words!</a>)</p>
<h3>Pushing tabs instead of posting&nbsp;links</h3>
<p>In Hotdish instead of <em>asking</em> someone to go to a link, you <em>push</em> a link to everyone.  The normal flow is you copy the <span class="caps">URL</span>, you go to your communication medium (instant message, chat room, shared document), you paste the <span class="caps">URL</span>, and then you beg everyone to please click it.  Then you ask if everyone is really there yet? Then you make sure everyone knows it wasn&#8217;t the second-to-last link, but the very last link you pasted.  Just this minute.  Wait, no, not the link that other person pasted in, though I suppose you should all go there too. <span class="caps">OK</span>, are we all on the same page now?  Oh wait, I just made a change, can everyone&nbsp;reload?</p>
<p>No: with Hotdish you just push the link, <em>make</em> it open for everyone, and once you&#8217;ve done it you&#8217;ll even get a second confirmation because we show who on a page.  The only problem is right now we open a background tab (because forcing a tab switch is too jarring), but I want to figure out how to push even harder, to let people be more assertive if they choose. Like maybe if you push twice in succession everyone gets a big &#8220;Alice really wants you to see: [page]&#8221; notification that you can&#8217;t really ignore, or if you explicitly ignore it then Alice knows you decided to ignore&nbsp;it.</p>
<h3>Presenting and peeking&nbsp;in</h3>
<p>Another example where we&#8217;re being aggressive: in Hotdish you can <em>present</em> a page to someone, showing them exactly what you see (including details that might not be the same for them if they went to the same <span class="caps">URL</span>).  But you can also <em>view</em> someone else&#8217;s page. When you &#8220;view&#8221; a page you are viewing the page exactly as the other person sees it (as opposed to simply visiting the same <span class="caps">URL</span> as the other person).  It&#8217;s like the ability to peek over anyone&#8217;s&nbsp;shoulder.</p>
<h3>Audio/video <span class="caps">CB</span>/walkie-talkie&nbsp;mode</h3>
<p>We haven&#8217;t added any voice tools to Hotdish yet.  It didn&#8217;t seem like the heart of what we were trying to explore &#8212; of course we knew we&#8217;d want to enable communication among the group, but we didn&#8217;t think we&#8217;d bring anything new, and so the effort didn&#8217;t feel like it would bring much.  But then we also hadn&#8217;t thought about how we might rethinking the ideas in this concept, instead we were just borrowing what seemed like the obvious&nbsp;interface.</p>
<p>After some thought a feature I&#8217;d like to try is a talk-at-anyone mode. This is a little like <a href="https://www.sqwiggle.com/">Sqwiggle</a>, where you can talk with anyone without confirmation.  Still I find the Sqwiggle model a little much, where anyone can watch me on their own volition. Maybe it&#8217;s fine, I might be wrong.  But I&#8217;m more open to anyone talking <em>to</em> me, and then requiring confirmation before they can listen or watch me. Having someone yell at me spontaneously would probably be annoying, but that&#8217;s a social&nbsp;problem.</p>
<h3>Sharing a record of your&nbsp;activity</h3>
<p>The core feature of Hotdish is that everyone can see any of the pages you open, and see some of your navigational behavior &#8212; like when you go to a new page or change active tabs.  Realistically you would not do everything in your Hotdish window (Hotdish exposes only one browser window to the group &#8212; everything you do in other windows remains personal), but I hope that Hotdish could allow people to do more things in front of their peers.  For instance, from an article <a href="https://source.opennews.org/en-US/learning/making-remote-work-work/"><em>Making Remote Work Work</em></a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It&#8217;s my earnest belief that some people will have higher expectations for you because you work remotely. It&#8217;s very easy for them to believe you&#8217;re in your underwear playing Final Fantasy instead of slogging through the documentation for Django. Not all work has obvious output and when they can&#8217;t see you at your desk, it&#8217;s tempting to log those blank hours as time&nbsp;wasted.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One of the hidden parts of work (paid work, school work, or volunteer work) that I want to expose with Hotdish is <strong>research</strong>. Research is slogging through the docs, finding out if some idea you&#8217;ve had <em>maybe</em> exists (and perhaps finding out doesn&#8217;t), it&#8217;s finding the right term, looking up a date or meeting&#8230; it&#8217;s all these little things we constantly do.  But those things are never the focus of &#8220;collaboration&#8221;.  Research is the stuff you do <em>before</em> you can tell anyone what you&#8217;ve learned. It gets seen as a prerequisite to accomplishing real work, instead of a part of what it means to <em>do</em> real work.  And yet when asked everyone will defend the value of research: we know we should value this thing, but because we have a hard time seeing it too often we do&nbsp;not.</p>
<p>By putting your work in front of anyone &#8212; even if you aren&#8217;t trying to share anything with anyone, or have not come to any determination &#8212; I hope we can make research as collaborative as conclusions&nbsp;are.</p>
<h3>Recording&nbsp;history</h3>
<p>A feature we are exploring is called the <em>Activity Log</em>: a persistent record what happens in the group. Our first foray into this is somewhat comically primitive, we are just pasting the activities into an <a href="http://etherpad.org/">Etherpad</a> document.  It&#8217;s primitive but I&#8217;m going to have a hard time getting myself to replace it because there&#8217;s something that just feels really <em>right</em> about using an&nbsp;editor.</p>
<p>After my <a href="http://www.ianbicking.org/blog/2014/02/hubot-chat-web-working-in-the-open.html">last post</a> I got <a href="https://plus.google.com/+IanBicking/posts/NvnBBQ6eCFe">a comment</a> challenging me to consider the &#8220;social implications of showing others one&#8217;s mistakes&#8221;.  A fair challenge, and honestly I have <em>tried</em> to ignore that for all the reasons I&#8217;m talking about here.  But I think in this silly model of recording activities to a text editor there is also a response to this: we keep a record, along with everything else we do, because we want to build a model for a constructive and supportive group to enhance their work together.  But a constructive and supportive group is also based on trust.  One of the ways we demonstrate trust is with things like using an editable document instead of a strict log: we should trust each other to edit history, and edit out history.  We should trust that people use that power&nbsp;well.</p>
<p>In a live environment like Hotdish it&#8217;s hard to actually make sure no one saw something.  You open a link, it shows up to everyone that moment.  You close it, and maybe we can figure out a way to keep it out of history, or allow you to remove it from history, but we can&#8217;t remove it from the memories of everyone who saw it.  But this is another kind of politeness: we ask that people respect even our retroactive attempts at privacy.  This is something that Facebook, for instance, works pretty hard at &#8212; they do their best to make deleted content really disappear.  Programmer-designed tools tend to be horrible at this.  I think because the programmer knows you can&#8217;t <em>really</em> delete history, you can&#8217;t know what has been recorded on other clients, you can&#8217;t erase people&#8217;s memory.  They don&#8217;t put value on politely agreeing to forget.  And so programmer-designed tools almost never let you edit history.  We will not make this&nbsp;mistake.</p>
<p>So that&#8217;s some of what we&#8217;re thinking.  Some of these ideas aren&#8217;t going to work out.  Dogfooding will be essential.  But we can&#8217;t see how far we can go with putting people together unless we go too far and then pull&nbsp;back.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m interested in other ideas for somewhat uncomfortably intimate browser-mediated sharing experiences.  Have&nbsp;any?</p></div>

<tr><td style='padding-left: 0px' colspan='2' class='dMessage'><p>I'm interested in how this might be used when most of the participants are in the same physical room.</p><p>I'm imagining a scenario where each person has their own dedicated tab within my browser. If they want to capture the attention of the group, they can do a thing that makes their tab start blinking.. or captures attention after a warning.</p><p>It would also be interesting to delegate presenting ability to a third party. So, I can mind my own business, someone else can pop in to see what I'm up to, and then they can push my activity to the larger group for whatever reason.</p><p>I'd also like to see view-casting of some kind. So a computer can be hooked up to the big presentation screen in the room and stay unattended while everyone else uses their own computers to push to the main screen.</p><p>Which actually leads to multi-screen applications. If I have my laptop and mobile devices connected to Hotdish, one or the other could show a social discovery/control interface of some kind.</p><p>This is starting to sound a bit like <a href="http://www.oblong.com/mezzanine/" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://www.oblong.com/mezzanine/">http://www.oblong.com/mezza...</a> actually..</p><p>The thought of messing with history makes me wonder if there might be some useful collaborative bookmarking action that could happen here. If I'm presenting, and viewers bookmark the page I'm currently on, I'd love to see some kind of notification.. perhaps a blinky bookmark star. Beyond this, shared bookmarking and annotation space tied to a session. The activity log is one potential output for this, but it strikes me that a collaborative editor that lets you play with bookmark-based data structures would be a great way to move research beyond Hotdish.</p><p>I wonder how downloads would be treated. There may be some interesting file sharing applications here. Shoot, how might Hotdish treat bittorrent magnet links?</p></td></tr>

<tr><td style='padding-left: 50px' colspan='2' class='dMessage'><p>I think the approach we're taking makes as much sense when you are co-located as not.  This is one of the reasons for being permissive and expecting people to come to their own understanding about how to interact.  If we're in the same room, for instance, we will have our own conversation about what we're doing, and the actions in the browser will flow from that.  If you have workflows and permissions and stuff going on then the tool draws you in and force you to interact via the tool.</p><p>Group-based bookmarking is something I've felt a desire for myself as I use the tool.  Adding notification as you suggest would also be good.  One could go even further and imagine a thumbs-up, but then I worry that would be too cloying.  But there is a subtle social interaction in the Like that appeals to me, and I sometimes want in other contexts.  I suppose more often when the group is large, and I want to signify approval without interrupting.</p><p>Thanks for the link to Mezzanine, I hadn't seen that and it's quite interesting.</p></td></tr>
