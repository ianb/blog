        <div class="entry-content"><p>Listening to <a class="reference external" href="http://www.tavistalks.com/">Tavis Smiley&#8217;s show</a> tonight, and the segment <a class="reference external" href="http://www.myamerica2008.org/">My America</a> where they talked about gun violence.  At one point they quote a man who lost his brother to gun&nbsp;violence:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You can be in a club and bump into somebody on accident, a little of your liquor, a little of your water spill on their coat, now, you go outside, he got five or six people out their because you spilled your damn drink.  Which, a person should be able to say, &#8220;man, my fault dog, I apologize, you know how it is.&#8221;  You got people that just ain&#8217;t gonna be right,&nbsp;man.</p>
<p><strong>Tavis Smiley:</strong> So you take that, you put guns into the equation, that changes mediation efforts&nbsp;dramatically.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Several times they talk about how small matters of respect lead to violence.  The conclusion is that guns are the&nbsp;problem.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t really know what to do with this.  In <em>my</em> life (and I suspect all of your lives) issues of respect do not lead to violence.  As a result I have a hard time thinking of this as a gun&nbsp;problem.</p>
<p><span class="caps">OK</span>, so it&#8217;s a violence problem.  The other thing that gets me is there&#8217;s this strong undertone to this conversation that &#8220;we aren&#8217;t doing enough.&#8221;  This attitude is of course the norm for an <span class="caps">NPR</span> show.  But it&#8217;s <em>not</em> <strong>we</strong> &#8212; I, and everyone I know is not part of this <strong>we</strong>.  My &#8220;we&#8221; does not resort to violence.  My &#8220;we&#8221; does not project respect into minor social interactions.  When I say it&#8217;s not &#8220;we&#8221;, I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s just that I tuned into the wrong radio show &#8212; am I being recruited into this &#8220;we&#8221;?  Do they really think listeners are part of this&nbsp;&#8220;we&#8221;?</p>
<p>There is no reflection in these shows about why <em>this</em> (whatever the issue of the show) is a general problem.  Of course most talk shows tend to generalize wildly, to turn every anecdote into a sign of some change in culture, some disease of our society, something more than just an anecdote.  (Though <a class="reference external" href="http://www.thislife.org/">some</a> <a class="reference external" href="http://thestory.org/">good</a> <span class="caps">NPR</span> shows do <em>not</em> attempt to generalize anecdotes at&nbsp;all.)</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a strong attitude, in this show and others, that this is a problem for us all to solve.  Why exactly is this a problem for me to solve?  Why is this a problem for government to solve?  (I&#8217;m not a conservative, but I feel it&#8217;s unfair that only conservatives seem to be able to ask that question: why should government solve&nbsp;this?)</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t ask these questions rhetorically (and maybe that makes me different from the conservatives, who tend to only ask questions rhetorically).  There may be a good answer to these questions.  But it&#8217;s far too easy to say &#8220;we must do something about this&#8221; without saying <em>who</em> and <em>why</em>.  We (especially those of us who listen to <span class="caps">NPR</span>) are all far too fatigued with the constant admonitions that not enough is being done, and something has to change.  This kind of approach is not an effective call to&nbsp;action.</p>
<p>And it&#8217;s yet another thing <a class="reference external" href="https://ianbicking.org/2008/03/31/environmental-guilt/">trying to make me feel bad for something that&#8217;s not my fault</a>.  And dammit, it really isn&#8217;t my&nbsp;fault!</p>
