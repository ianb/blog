        <div class="entry-content"><p>So, I was at a university the other day, talking with some people about a sprint project, and there was a student there.  He was somewhat eager to write &#8220;algorithms&#8221;.  I&#8217;m not sure what that means exactly, but I was reminded of him because I was just about to write a function to make an absolute path relative and this somehow felt like an &#8220;algorithm&#8221;.  That&#8217;s not how I&#8217;d describe most of the coding I&nbsp;do.</p>
<p>But I digress&#8230; this student seemed to be excited about his ability.  Well, okay, young programmers tend to be very eager, and often overestimate their ability (or the difficulty of the task).  For students in this position I think it&#8217;s good to let them take on large projects, so they can get a better concept of their ability.  This student seemed to take to heart the idea that a typical programmer produces 10 lines of working code a day.  People who hear this are inclined to think &#8220;damn, I can write way more than 10 lines of code a&nbsp;day!&#8221;</p>
<p>I suspect a more fair way of thinking about this is that on average a programmer gets 50 lines of code into production a week, or 200 lines a month.  Sure, lots of people are more productive than this, but the actual lines of code that go into production are usually way smaller than it feels like during the process that goes into getting that code there.  That student had probably never gotten a single line of code into production.  I&#8217;m pretty sure he wouldn&#8217;t have appreciated what that getting code into production is different than just hacking out some&nbsp;code.</p>
<p>The kid didn&#8217;t end up hanging around.  I don&#8217;t think we had any algorithms for him.  That&#8217;s too bad, maybe he could have seen what programming really looks&nbsp;like.</p>
<p>Another what-is-programming-really-like story&#8230; Emily was working on <a class="reference external" href="http://potteryblog.com">her blog</a> and editing some templates to change the feed <span class="caps">URL</span>.  It didn&#8217;t work, and I took a look at it and showed her that somehow a space had gotten into the <span class="caps">URL</span>, so she had to go back and correct them all.  She found this frustrating.  I pointed out to her that this is exactly what I spend my days&nbsp;doing.</p>
<p>Some people seem angered when people call writing <span class="caps">HTML</span> &#8220;programming&#8221;.  Personally I do not.  Most programming is a lot more like writing <span class="caps">HTML</span> than it&#8217;s like writing a compiler.  I bet writing a compiler is a lot more like writing <span class="caps">HTML</span> than what most programmers think it&#8217;s like to write a&nbsp;compiler.</p>
