        <div class="entry-content"><p>This is about <a class="reference external" href="http://code.google.com/appengine/">Google App Engine</a> which probably everyone has read about&nbsp;already.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m quite excited about it.  Hosting has been the bane of the Python web world for a long time.  This provides a very compelling hosting situation for Python&nbsp;applications.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not as interested in this from a competitive perspective as I am from a simple this-is-awesome perspective.  Regardless of how this positions Python relative to other languages, this is something Python needs.  But even looking beyond that, I think this is something the open source world needs.  Open source web development is in a funny place.  There&#8217;s a lot of reasons why web programming is a good domain for open source.  The barrier to entry for web development is extremely low.  Developers have choice in their tools, as browsers don&#8217;t really care what software you use so long as you serve up <span class="caps">HTML</span>.  This leads to experimentation and excitement and the kind of self-direction that is very motivating to developers.  It leads to the kind of personal excitement that underlies most open source&nbsp;development.</p>
<p>Despite this, open source web application development doesn&#8217;t seem sustainable.  There&#8217;s <em>some</em> applications, sure.  WordPress, Trac, MediaWiki, MoinMoin.  But most wiki software doesn&#8217;t have a vibrant community.  Many a bug tracker has fallen by the wayside.  Blog software projects have a horrible time building a viable community.  Other website software hardly gets anywhere at all.  A lot of the development that might <em>appear</em> to be application development really is more like a framework when you look closely (e.g., Plone,&nbsp;Drupal).</p>
<p>I think deployment concerns are a huge part of this.  And, <a class="reference external" href="https://ianbicking.org/2008/01/12/what-php-deployment-gets-right/">given its better deployment story</a>, it&#8217;s no surprise <span class="caps">PHP</span> is the basis of most viable open source web applications.  Being interested in a project requires that you be able to <em>use</em> the product (and usually use it casually, as that&#8217;s the point of entry for many developers).  Right now most people can&#8217;t use open source web&nbsp;applications.</p>
<p>But people <em>can use</em> hosted applications, and that&#8217;s where all the effort has gone in the past few years.  I am comfortable saying that Trac is a better issue tracker than Google Code&#8217;s issue tracker.  But I&#8217;d probably recommend Google Code to someone starting a new project, because it&#8217;s so much less work.  Similarly I&#8217;d try to dissuade most people from installing their own blog software.  I still don&#8217;t know what to tell people about a <span class="caps">CMS</span>.</p>
<p>Many people are excited about how far up you might be able to scale something based on App Engine, but (like <a class="reference external" href="http://www.scripting.com/stories/2008/04/08/earlyNotesOnGoogleapps.html">Dave</a>) I&#8217;m excited about how far it could be scaled down.  For the majority of sites the free quota will be more than enough.  But that alone isn&#8217;t the point: there&#8217;s lots of free services people can use.  The difference here is that the free services can be modified and controlled by the anyone who signs up and installs an&nbsp;application.</p>
<p>From the perspective of open source it&#8217;s a bit awkward that the platform itself is proprietary.  <a class="reference external" href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2008/04/09/Google-Users-API">Questions about sharecropping are a valid concern</a>, but I&#8217;m optimistic about the ultimate outcome.  The <span class="caps">SDK</span> is under a permissive open source license, and the APIs are all reasonable enough that they could be reimplemented with open source backends (maybe without the same scalability, but that&#8217;s not the aspect I care about anyway).  Perhaps the BigTable APIs will serve as the <a class="reference external" href="http://radian.org/notebook/google-datastore">basis for future storage APIs</a>.</p>
<p>But even if other people make compatible implementations of these APIs, would it matter?  If Google offers free hosting, is someone else really going to be able to provide a better hosting option?  Or would these other implementations just be strawmen, a way to show that It Could Be Done?  If the libraries are just written to prove a point, I can&#8217;t see them gaining much traction.  But I think these could be viable as there are other constraints to the App Engine environment that people may want to escape at some point in their application&nbsp;development.</p>
<p>As to the details of App Engine?  Can you run Pylons or Paste on it?  Well, that&#8217;s a topic for another&nbsp;post.</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> I <a class="reference external" href="https://ianbicking.org/2008/04/09/app-engine-commodity-vs-proprietary/">wrote up some more&nbsp;thoughts</a></p>
