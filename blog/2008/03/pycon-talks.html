        <div class="entry-content"><p>I gave my talk at <a class="reference external" href="http://us.pycon.org/2008/about/">PyCon</a> this year on <span class="caps">HTML</span> processing in Python.  It seemed to be well received, but I did see some comments on the web from people who wanted more technical content.  The presentation I ended up giving was really more about <span class="caps">HTML</span> and its place and advantages compared with <span class="caps">XML</span> and <span class="caps">XHTML</span>.  Basically I decided to talk about <em>why</em> you want to process <span class="caps">HTML</span>, instead of getting too much into <em>how</em>.  I talked a <em>little bit</em> about how, but if you had hoped to hear much technical substance then certainly it would have been disappointing.  (As to the slide question, I will get them up, but I want to assemble at least a little of the material that motivated it, since slides alone aren&#8217;t that&nbsp;useful.)</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not sure what to do for talks like these.  In 30 minutes it is hard to go into much depth about a subject.  And I&#8217;m not sure what the purpose would be.  If you want to learn to use a tool you should read the documentation, sit down with a computer, and give it a try.  You certainly shouldn&#8217;t come to a talk.  So I&#8217;ve tried to avoid the technical details, and instead try to make people <em>want</em> to learn the &#8220;how&#8221; on their own.  This was the goal of my <a class="reference external" href="https://ianbicking.org/docs/wsgi-presentation/img0.html"><span class="caps">WSGI</span> talk</a> last year as&nbsp;well.</p>
<p>That said, the whole talk format was unsatisfying to me at PyCon. Lightning Talks are great (or at least, <em>can</em> be great &#8212; and I thought on Sunday when all the sponsors were gone, they <em>were</em> great).  But 30 minute is too much time for just presenting an idea, and too little time (and a poor format) for presenting advanced content.  And that slides are built into the format just makes it&nbsp;worse.</p>
<p>I wish the <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Space_Technology">Open Spaces</a> had been more functional at PyCon.  I couldn&#8217;t find the ones I wanted and felt conflicted between them and talks (in retrospect of course there shouldn&#8217;t have been conflict).  I didn&#8217;t have a single successful Open Space experience this year, despite trying a couple&nbsp;times.</p>
<p>While the organization of Open Spaces could be improved, I don&#8217;t think Just In Time Planning is going to work at PyCon.  And I don&#8217;t think Open Spaces <em>have</em> to be <span class="caps">JIT</span>.  What makes them most interesting isn&#8217;t that they are totally ad hoc, but that they aren&#8217;t just one person talking to a bunch of other people.  I&#8217;d have been very happy to lead some more extensive &#8220;talk&#8221; about <span class="caps">HTML</span> and <span class="caps">XML</span> processing in Python, probably starting out with 10-15 minutes of introduction and survey and then going completely to discussion, Q/A, or wherever the attendees wanted to take it.  I would expect a smaller group of people (I guess), as it would be a larger time commitment and attendance would feel less casual than just showing up at a normal talk.  Maybe it could be clearly setup so that it was something like 10-15 minutes of introduction, 30-35 minutes of talking, and then a clearly planned structure for people to stop talking (moving on to another topic) or stick around to talk more in a smaller and more intimate space and group.  Figuring out <em>where</em> to continue the discussion should not be left until the moment everyone has to choose whether to stay or leave.  You&#8217;d have to be careful not to let it degenerate into people just asking questions of only personal interest.  I&#8217;m pretty comfortable generalizing people&#8217;s overly specific questions.  People who are less comfortable doing that might benefit from a moderator to help them guide the&nbsp;discussion.</p>
<p>This format seems like <em>much</em> less work for me as a speaker (and the stress of speaking greatly infringes on my enjoyment of the conference), it seems more likely to fit the interests of the attendees, and I think it can provide benefit for a much wider range of interests and experience&nbsp;levels.</p>
<p>Anyway, an idea.  I&#8217;m not sure how things <em>should</em> be structured at PyCon next year, but I&#8217;m pretty sure the current talk format isn&#8217;t it.  A few talks, sure: The State Of X talks can work well, as do talks about ideas and experience instead of talks about tools and libraries.  But I think one track could be&nbsp;sufficient.</p>
