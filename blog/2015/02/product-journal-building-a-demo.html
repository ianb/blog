        <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve been trying to work through a post on technology choices, as I had it in my mind that we should rewrite substantial portions of the product.  We&#8217;ve just upped the team size to two, adding <a href="http://donovanpreston.blogspot.com/">Donovan Preston</a>, and it&#8217;s an opportunity to share in some of these decisions. And get rid of code that was desperately expedient.  The server is only <a href="https://github.com/mozilla-services/pageshot/blob/f3df30ccaf64b75426e87325addc6fac373ba220/appengine/pageshotpages/main.py">400ish lines</a>, with some significant copy-and-paste, so we&#8217;re not losing any big&nbsp;investment.</p>
<p>Now I wonder if part of the <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000069.html">danger of a rewrite</a> isn&#8217;t the effort, but that it&#8217;s an excuse to go heads-down and starve your situational&nbsp;awareness.</p>
<p>In other news there has been a <a href="http://blog.johnath.com/2015/02/17/home-for-a-rest/">major resignation</a> at Mozilla.  I&#8217;d read into it largely what Johnathan implies in his post: things seem to be on a good track, so he&#8217;s comfortable leaving. But the <span class="caps">VP</span> of Firefox can&#8217;t leave without some significant organizational impact.  Now is an important time for me to be situationally aware, and for the product itself to show situational awareness.  The technical underpinnings aren&#8217;t that relevant at this&nbsp;moment.</p>
<p>So instead, if only for a few days, I want to move back into expedient demoable product mode.  Now is the time to explain the product to other people in&nbsp;Mozilla.</p>
<p>The choices this implies feel weird at times.  What is most important? Security bugs?  Hardly!  It needs to demonstrate some things to different&nbsp;stakeholders:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>There are some technical parts that require demonstration.  Can we freeze the <span class="caps">DOM</span> and produce something usable?  Only an existence proof is really convincing.  Can we do a login system?  Of course!  So I build out the <span class="caps">DOM</span> freezing and fix bugs in it, but I&#8217;m preparing to build a login system where you type in your email address.  I&#8217;m sure you wouldn&#8217;t lie so we&#8217;ll just believe you are who you say you&nbsp;are.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>But I want to get to the interesting questions.  Do we require a login for this system?  If not, what can an anonymous user do?  I don&#8217;t have an answer, but I want to engage people in the question.  I think one of the best outcomes of a demo is having people think about these questions, offer up solutions and criticisms.  If the demo makes everyone really impressed with how smart I am that is very self-gratifying, but it does not engage people with the product, and I want to build engagement.  To ask a good question I do need to build enough of the context to clarify the question.  I at least need fake&nbsp;logins.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I&#8217;ve been getting design/user experience help from <a href="http://www.brampitoyo.com/">Bram Pitoyo</a> too, and now we have a number of interesting mockups.  More than we can implemented in short order.  I&#8217;m trying to figure out how to integrate these mockups into the demo itself &#8212; as simple as &#8220;also look at this idea we have&#8221;.  We should maintain a similar style (colors, basic layout), so that someone can look at a mockup and use all the context that I&#8217;ve introduced from the live&nbsp;demo.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>So far I&#8217;ve put no effort into onboarding.  A person who picks up the tool may have no idea how it is supposed to be used.  Or maybe they would figure it out: I haven&#8217;t even thought it through.  Since <em>I</em> know how it works, and I&#8217;m doing the demo, that&#8217;s okay.  My in-person narration is the onboarding experience.  But even if I&#8217;m trying to explain the product internally, I should recognize I&#8217;m cutting myself off from an organic growth of&nbsp;interest.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There are other stakeholders I keep forgetting about.  I need to speak to the <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/manifesto/">Mozilla Mission</a>. I think I have a good story to tell there, but it&#8217;s not the conventional wisdom of what it means to embody the mission.  I see this as a tool of direct outward-facing individual empowerment, not the mediated power of federation, not the opting-out power of privacy, not the committee-mediated and developer driven power of&nbsp;standards.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Another stakeholder: people who care about the Firefox brand and marketing our products.  Right now the tool lacks any branding, and it would be inappropriate to deploy this as a branded product right now. But I can <em>demo</em> a branded product.  There may also be room to experiment with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_to_action_(marketing)">call to action</a>, and to start a discussion about what that would mean.  I shouldn&#8217;t be afraid to do it really badly, because that starts the conversation, and I&#8217;d rather attract the people who think deeply about these things than try to solve them&nbsp;myself.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>So I&#8217;m off now on another iteration of really scrappy coding, along with some strategic&nbsp;fakery.</p></div>
