        <div class="entry-content"><p>At some point in a <a href="http://www.earwolf.com/show/startup-school/">podcast series</a> by Seth Godin he advises that you never give your house for collateral on a loan for your business.  Of course you don&#8217;t want to lose your house, but that wasn&#8217;t his reason.  If you put your house on the line – and put your family on the line – then you are putting up something you aren&#8217;t willing to lose.  And so you have an upper bound on your risk: you no longer will be willing to make the decisions that could bankrupt your&nbsp;business.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been thinking about emotional labor lately.  In management it&#8217;s one of the more challenging things for me: because there&#8217;s a lot more emotional labor to be done in management, but also because I feel I can fuck it up much worse.  I also see all the missed opportunities to put in emotional labor, and I wonder about what I can or should ask of my reports in addition to what I ask of myself.  Emotional labor is checking in with how people <em>feel</em> (explicitly or implicitly).  It&#8217;s not letting conflict slide.  It&#8217;s making sure to explicitly appreciate your coworkers.  It&#8217;s giving bad news fast.  And negative feedback.  It&#8217;s hard work, an uncomfortable&nbsp;hard.</p>
<p>Emotional investment is something different.  It&#8217;s what you expect of yourself.  It&#8217;s <em>caring</em>.  I find the emotional labor hard; it is because of my emotional investment that I want to do it&nbsp;anyway.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve started to question the value of emotional investments.  There&#8217;s passion, yes.  And some degree of having skin in the game – not just wanting to perform sufficiently, or be well regarded, but a direct interest in the success of the project.  But you can make the wrong kinds of investments, invest something that&#8217;s too hard to lose.  Your self-worth, your identity&#8230; these are investments you shouldn&#8217;t ask yourself to make, and I&#8217;d say <em>no thank you</em> when I see someone else offering that kind of investment if I could.  It&#8217;s the kind of investment that will lead to bad decisions: sticking with safe choices, avoiding bad feedback, being afraid to ship, being afraid to do the work you think is important but you aren&#8217;t sure you can achieve successfully.  Or it may embolden you to drive off an emotional cliff, to burn&nbsp;out.</p>
<p>Sadness, frustration, even anger are okay emotions to have about our work.  It&#8217;s okay for work to make us feel, so long as we can bounce back from those feelings.  One kind of emotional labor is to own and respond to your&nbsp;feelings.</p>
<p>With a growing skepticism of emotional investment I find myself valuing professionalism a bit more: professionalism as <em>action and impact through discipline</em>.  But I also think discipline can used as a substitute for engagement.  I&#8217;m still wary of professionalism&#8230; wary of finding a substitute for passion, skeptical those substitutes are genuine, unsure if &#8220;performance&#8221; is a good criteria.  But I&#8217;m feeling more open.  (And of course I much rather Accounting be staffed professionally than with passion, so it must depend on desired&nbsp;outcomes.)</p>
<p>At this moment I am trying to disinvest.  For my own health, but I also hope to improve my effectiveness.  It&#8217;s uncomfortable, feels cold, like I have to withdraw in order to set new terms of engagement.  But what do I have to lose?  Maybe a little&nbsp;less.</p></div>
