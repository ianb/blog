<tr><td style='padding-left: 0px' colspan='2' class='dMessage'><p>I had this exact same feeling/ thing descend on me this year. Not like I was in denial before- just a innate feeling of seriousness just popped up in me and it's slightly new-- but very solid, Still pleasurable-- but a feeling of my age and just a heavier feeling. BUt.. perhaps more full of love.  I also think it was caused by my mom dying and the immense ness of that __Even though we all know that's what happens.</p></td></tr>

<tr><td style='padding-left: 0px' colspan='2' class='dMessage'><p>I swear I commented before, but somehow it was lost.  I was just talking to a friend (Margaret) about what you wrote.  I feel that each paragraph is worthy of an hour discussion.  I, too, felt that I was middle-aged when I was young in my thirties.  Whenever I shared that thought, my peers scoffed me.  You have defined middle aged in such a thoughtful way.  Thanks for sharing and maybe you and I should get together and philosophize about age sometime soon.</p></td></tr>

<tr><td style='padding-left: 0px' colspan='2' class='dMessage'><p>Just this evening I realized that in many ways my life is insignificant.  That is not particularly depressing but is true.  My life is small to the world at large.  It is even small to some of those who have known me for a long time.  During a discussion with a friend, I have known for many, many years,  it was obvious that she had forgotten that I had cancer a few years ago. For her my cancer was insignificant.  Of course, it was very significant to me.  And maybe to my family also.  That importance means little to the community at large.  Still I live my life as we all do.</p></td></tr>
