<tr><td style='padding-left: 0px' colspan='2' class='dMessage'><p>I think you're correct that Open Source removes the scarcity of the product you're trying to sell in favor of asking for support to maintain the service you provide. There are ways to increase the likelihood of patronage (closely tie a given product to a dedicated service that you offer, increase the "network effect" benefit of that service, etc.)</p><p>For instance, wordpress doesn't sell the blogging platform, it sells the convenience of not having to deal with servers and updates. Bitwarden doesn't sell password management, it sells the secure syncing back end that bitwarden used by default across platforms, etc. It could be that mozilla offers similar extended services at a reasonable price for folks looking for convenience. Power users should still be able to "roll their own" when possible, but I'd also argue that mozilla shouldn't really be on the hook to support those independent services as well.</p></td></tr>

Lots of things have value that aren't scarce, and lots of scarce things don't have value (it would be hard for anyone to acquire my nail clippings, and yet they remain seemingly valueless!) If you have something of value, then scarcity helps leverage that value and avoid competitors. But software scarcity isn't the only way (e.g., in the case of a software service, simple operational and technical knowledge of the software is scarce, even if other people can look at the source).</p></td></tr>

<tr><td style='padding-left: 0px' colspan='2' class='dMessage'><p>Open Source is certainly not designed to make money--it's the best software development methodology for certain types of software (especially infrastructure).  This does not mean that open source development can't be used to enhance a business model. Or even that "free" can't be effectively utilized by a business. The challenge is that using open source as part of your business model is hard. Every business is different. Therefore there are rules of thumb, but no proven recipes that always work. In fact, I think this question is worthy of academic research. To shed light on the ways that some successful businesses are using open source, I created a podcast called "Open Source Underdogs" It's on iTunes, Soundcloud, Stitcher, etc and you can also find it on <a href="https://opensourceunderdogs.com" rel="nofollow noopener" title="https://opensourceunderdogs.com">https://opensourceunderdogs...</a>  Although I'm the founder of an open source business, and thought I knew something about this topic, I keep learning more as I interview more guests. There is a lot of nuance in this conversation--no black and white, but a lot of shades of gray. To flush out that nuance, I suggest listening to some of the first hand accounts--even if you're an open source guru.</p></td></tr>

<tr><td style='padding-left: 0px' colspan='2' class='dMessage'><p>If you ever get a chance, maybe talk to Bryan Cantrill about this? Joyent sells open-source as a matter of pride, and at several of his talks he seems to be saying that your analysis is somewhat backwards: that is, you should be starting conceptually from a business model which is profitable (even when the source is closed) and your lament presumably isn't a lament about "how do we make ANY money at ALL ever?!". So once you have a profitable business model in mind, <i>then</i> you think about what open source does to it, and he recommends that you think not the obvious "what is this going to get me?" but the less-obvious "what is this going to cost me?" because generally that marginal cost is zero. The worries about lost revenue are then exposed: that person who was going to fork your product and self-support it and do all of the work themselves, so they never pay you in any way, then <i>they were never going to pay you for the product</i> in the first place. If they hadn't been contributing to your product they'd have built their own or found your open-source competition or whatever, but they wouldn't have paid you at any point. So there is zero first-order impact on revenue and there is a solid second-order impact on revenue because you are building a community and they attract more users who will pay you.</p><p>So following that example, Joyent starts from some idea of "let's sell cloud computing like AWS and Azure and Google Cloud do", and that's a stable business plan. You have to start from the business plan. But then all of the software that it develops to do that, it open-sources. In response to questions about "aren't you worried that Microsoft and Amazon and Google will just steal your competitive edge?" he loudly boasts, "no, they would rather die than concede defeat." In other words, they're saying "ew, SmartOS, that's <i>Joyent's</i> code, we can do better; we can't refactor <i>now</i> we have too many eggs in this basket; if we modify <i>their</i> code it's copylefted under MPL and we'll need to <i>share</i> our innovations; etc. etc."</p></td></tr>

And so I agree: designing a business first, then designing software second, at least gives the project a fighting chance.</p><p>But there's a problem here: the way we've become used to open source happening is as an emergent side project. Somebody has an idea, someone else likes it and contributes, stuff snowballs, and so on. Now you have something of value... and no business plan. It's at this too-late-in-the-game point that someone then tries to apply a business plan.</p><p>Mozilla itself (unlike Joyent) is a microcosm of this same pattern. Lots of important open source comes out of Mozilla, but do we make any money off it? Never! These projects start as side projects, and to Mozilla's credit they can emerge as genuine supported projects... but by then it's too late. They weren't designed to make money, and they have to justify themselves with second-order effects (on our mission, on Firefox, on some kind of prestige) which is dangerously unsustainable.</p></td></tr>

<tr><td style='padding-left: 0px' colspan='2' class='dMessage'><p>I wonder whether or not "Open Source" has become like those pedestrian crosswalk buttons in NYC. The buttons are not actually connected to the lights, they just exist to make the users waiting for the light to change to feel like they have some illusion of power over their fate.</p><p>When we were all running software locally on our "Personal Computers", open source promised a level of freedom to modify and control that software. If you had the knowledge and understanding, you could alter the software to do whatever you wanted.</p><p>But now that we live in an era of distributed, networked web services, where the vast majority of the software that we run isn't actually running on our local machines, what does it really matter whether the software running on the remote server is open source or not, with regards to that promise of personal freedom?</p><p>What difference would it make to me as an end user to have access to gmail's source code? The freedom to customize or change it has been traded for the convenience of somebody else being responsible for the operation of that software. People no longer touch software. They interact with services.</p><p>Browsers seem to be in the unique positions of being the "last piece of software people still use on a local machine", so maybe thats some exception to the rule, but I'd be willing to bet there's fewer than 100 people out there who have customized an open source browser for their own needs that do not work on browsers for a living. So Im struggling to find any examples of where open source actually grants anybody the promised 'freedom'.</p><p>Of course open source is still valuable from a learning and understanding/security review standpoint, but its promise of freedom feels hollow at this point.</p></td></tr>

<tr><td style='padding-left: 50px' colspan='2' class='dMessage'><p>I knew I was missing something: Software market placement and product management is very important. Most personal users for open source products will not be paying software, but you can enforce enterprise customers to pay and comply with the law of your license terms. Such is the case of WinRAR. Ever seen a random individual paying for it? Hardly, but companies must pay for it if they want to get fully certified and comply with the law. RARlab doesn't need to enforce this, as using pirated software is already bad for a company applying for government and industry compliance of any sort. (I know WinRAR is not open source, but this model can apply to open source as well).</p><p>So getting real and being honest with yourself with your open source offering is really important. Students, home users and some cheapskate professionals will not be paying premium open source software, even if the premium product saves them time and is of great convenience. Nonetheless, your software should have certain features for the enterprise, not accessible in the free product. You can monetize it like this:<br>- A subscription model that allows you to update to the latest version. Even if your customer has access to your open source code... it's very unlikely they'll take on the project themselves and stop paying you, the repository owner and expert in your own area. Unless your customer was Facebook, Google, Amazon or similar -where highly skilled engineers are a dime a dozen- even with code access they'll hardly touch it. That's the reality I perceive. Great opportunity to sell some premium support and service contracts.<br>- If your product relies on premium data, have the product for free, but make the data feed subscription-based.</p><p>What I like about open source is the fact that open source is free as in freedom, but not necessarily free as in free beer. One doesn't need to be a hippie! :-)</p></td></tr>
