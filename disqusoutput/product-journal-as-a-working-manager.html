<tr><td style='padding-left: 0px' colspan='2' class='dMessage'><p>I'm a working manager, a scrum master for the team and I manage a 50% product development slash 50% operations team (I'm committing multiple sins, as you can see) so I can very much relate to your struggles. What I've been more or less successfully doing in the last couple of months was nail down my schedule 2-3 weeks in advance. Even if I don't always stick to my plan or get interrupted during, having a slot in my calendar pre-allocated for a certain activity dramatically reduces my cognitive load and allows me to focus on doing the work rather than deciding what to work on. Also, multitasking does work if one of the activities is completely automatic.</p></td></tr>

<tr><td style='padding-left: 0px' colspan='2' class='dMessage'><p>I'm very interested in reading the outcome of this balance. Juggling is the focusing on one object long enough to suspend it while focusing on another. You hope you get back to that object fast enough to give it the attention it needs. Writing some sort of complex algorithm or working through a difficult workflow AND managing operates completely outside of one focused contextual ball in a particular state. That ball is rotating, it may have changed shape, it may not even be in the routine anymore. I've tried it once and only once and I quickly learned that it's just not possible to be as effective without focusing on one or the other.</p></td></tr>
