I fully accept that sometimes we just have to jump, when it's not something worth expending political capital and fighting over, that's just how things go, but I want to have trust within our own team so that in our private 1:1s and such, we can acknowledge that we don't think it's a good idea without necessarily leading to sandbagging.</p><p>But I've been told that that's not always effective for motivating a team, so it's a preference, that brutal honesty makes me *more* likely to work hard even if I disagree (because at least there's the hope that next time we won't make this same mistake, if at least some people acknowledge it was a bad idea). Otherwise if everything is always sold to us as the Next Best Thing, I'll end up believing none of it at all.</p>",
