I'm not sure I entirely agree (once you have hosting, you have to start dealing with all the problems involved in hosting, and centralization is part of that), but I like how you put it. And I totally agree that hosting is the big need. I'm running into it with my son right now, who is playing around with writing his own websites, but I don't really want to pay for dedicated server or NAT through to my desktop like I used to.</p><p>But I have one solution to this, which is that I've started using github for hosting. I'm not really that fond of git or the github workflow, but that doesn't really matter because the big need is precisely what you say: hosting. And with gh-pages, github will host anything you can squeeze into HTML/CSS/JS files. You can even use github as a datastore. See, for example, <a href=\"https://mrgiggles.github.io/histoire/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" title=\"https://mrgiggles.github.io/histoire/\">https://mrgiggles.github.io...</a> (note that I'm not sure they really intend to be a hosting company, so I don't know how much of this they'll really put up with.)</p>",

Signing up for GitHub isn't terribly hard, but there's a bunch of complicated steps after that, and honestly I don't know how easy it is to create something that can write to a git repository \u2013 probably the blog software still has to have its own server, though at least it wouldn't have to actually handle hosting people's blogs.</p><p>If you did figure out a way to make it feasible, I have a feeling GitHub would not be appreciative (and might block the tool). My understanding is that ghpages is pretty cheap to run, but I suspect they rely on a certain niche status to make the other operational issues reasonable.</p><p>That said, my understanding of the economics of static publishing is that they are very reasonable, and one server can serve literally hundreds of thousands of (low-traffic) sites. It's all about the hassle. And the more accessible you make your service, they more you are opening yourself up to hassles.</p>",

        "message": "<p>I don't think decentralization offers any real features, but has many costs. It's not cheaper, the costs are just distributed. Fully decentralized means there's no one taking any responsibility, and you are hoping that initial engineering can anticipate all the problems. Federated means there's just several people taking responsibility, in a functional federated system there's a kind of cabal of responsible people, and in a dysfunctional system no one really takes care of anything. All of this to solve the wrong problem.</p><p>You want to provide affordable hosting that isn't subsidized with ads or other manipulation? The easiest and cheapest and most reliable way to do that is with traditional web hosting. People are successfully doing that right now with a very low cost. The attention required to maintain those services is not as cheap, but decentralization doesn't solve that problem (except by creating a completely unmaintained space).</p><p>Do you want to create something that is hard to censor? From what I can tell the only solid way to do that is some form of steganography: you have to hide things in other traffic, other protocols, other materials. I don't have an answer, but I'm not confident decentralization technologies answer this either. It's also unclear to me that anti-censorship should be the highest priority. It feels like an aside.</p><p>The real challenge I see is in making something that is accessible, that addresses a bunch of use cases, that gets good user consent for changes, that provides management both within and above individual use cases or applications, allows some kind of cohesive information architecture despite disparate applications, etc.</p>",
