It would be nice if, after taking a screenshot, it could be shared directly from the notification item. Perhaps with a share button.</p></td></tr>

I have some of this capability through <a href="http://pinboard.in" rel="nofollow noopener" title="pinboard.in">pinboard.in</a>, which crawls and archives web pages that I bookmark. But I can't highlight or save something inside a page with any granularity, and I can't share the archived copies (without going to some effort to copy the archived copies to some other server which I control).</p></td></tr>
