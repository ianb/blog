After seven years of doing the lion's share of my coding in Python, working in Javascript on the IPython Notebook in the last few months has made me face similar sobering realizations. It's humbling to start afresh and wade through new sets of challenges.</p><p>I'm saddened to hear that you haven't found the JS community yet, either. My guess is that, over time, there will be enough Pythonista ex-pats and dual citizens to make `bower install community` a reality. Community matters in a way that transgresses our tools, languages, operating systems. Connections between people strengthen the technical ecosystem, not the other way around.</p><p>As one small anecdote, for our part, the JavaScript portion of the IPython Notebook uses PEP 8's `lower_case_with_underscores` naming convention in defiance of JavaScript's camelCasing - just to help us feel a little more at home :) and to keep track of what's ours and what's external.</p></td></tr>

At least Python has many systems and web development libraries and can be used for alot of things.  Not so much for Javascript.  Rather than writing solutions looking for a problem, it's better identify problems and then write the solution for that particular problem.  I'd say there are more people doing Python than Javascript for systems and web tasks.  Also, there are more people doing Perl or C/C++ or PHP or Java than Python and Javascript combined.  If benchmarks are any clue, I would start doing systems development in Go before Python or Javascript.</p></td></tr>

It hasn't gained much traction, but I learned a lot, and I think there are some ideas in there that I want to do more with.</p><p>Strangely enough I find myself back writing Python code again, trying to express what I've learned about web frameworks in a last 15 years or so in a compact form, Morepath. I'm excited about it. But I expect I'll be pulled back to the client again soon, and there are ideas I want to explore, so that is good. And Morepath is a web framework that intends to serve the modern rich-client web application that I've gained much experience over the last years.</p><p>I've found it hard to find a clear community in the JavaScript world myself; it's a more multi-polar world than Python, but ideas do spread through it.

<tr><td style='padding-left: 0px' colspan='2' class='dMessage'><p>Thank you so much for this soulful and inspiring  article.</p><p>Coding _is_ creating, and obviously you are a great creator. Please do not stop your search. It seems JavaScript still is not your perfect place. There _is_ such a thing as joy in coding, as a continuous, cheerful enthusiasm for this craft.</p><p>You mentioned the "10,000 hours" factor (I believe I read that on Peter Norvig's "Teach Yourself Programming in Ten Years"), JavaScript, and how you value (rightfully so) a good, closely knit community.</p><p>Please consider to spend some time with Common Lisp. It has a very nice community (best experienced live), and very close connection to JavaScript as well (see ParenScript: <a href="http://common-lisp.net/projects/parenscript)" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://common-lisp.net/projects/parenscript)">http://common-lisp.net/proj...</a>. Its power, i.e. creative power, are second to none. Please, don't take my or anybody's words for it. Just give it a try. The closest one can find to real joy in programming can definitely be found in Lisp.</p><p>Why don't you check it out at the next (7th) European Lisp Symposium?<br><a href="http://www.european-lisp-symposium.org/" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://www.european-lisp-symposium.org/">http://www.european-lisp-sy...</a></p><p>I just feel you would be an outstanding creator with Common Lisp, and you are getting so much closer to it now.</p><p>Thank you!</p><p>PS: <a href="http://replove.herokuapp.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://replove.herokuapp.com/">http://replove.herokuapp.com/</a></p></td></tr>

That community feels like it has more of a BDFL (Rich Hickey) vibe to it, supported by luminaries analogous to Tim Something-with-many-dashes-that-I-don't-know-how-to-emulate-ly Peters, Andrew Kuchling, some guy who works at Mozilla and just recently took on a huge responsibility, and so on... I haven't gotten very far in, yet, and I still use Python on the back end, but I'm pretty sure Clojure is where I'll put my next 10k hours.</p></td></tr>

However you post made complete sense to me, and I applaud you for walking the new path. Sometimes our medium of expression fails to live up to the way we want to express ourselves, and you have to make a hard choice. Keep making beautiful things, sir - I wish you all the best.</p></td></tr>

I've really enjoyed creating and using minimalistic servers that don't need to be updated to extend the functionality of a project.</p></td></tr>
