<tr><td style='padding-left: 0px' colspan='2' class='dMessage'><p>I really love Firefox screenshots and is one reason I've switched to Firefox almost completely! Other useful tools would be some kind of annotation system. I use <a href="http://hypothes.is" rel="nofollow noopener" title="hypothes.is">hypothes.is</a> and it would be great if it was better integrated.</p><p>You asked what a Unix toolset would look like on the web. This is hard because many things may not end up being incremental, but if we had to start, I imagine something like the following (btw, I'm not a fan of text streams, but it doesn't affect the bigger idea here):</p><p>- You have URLs that point to 'content' and URLs that point to 'tranformers'.</p><p>- You transform content by piping it through the tranformer. For instance, I type this in my browser: `https://my/data | https://other/transform?param=value` - it converts the data via the transformer and displays it in the browser.</p><p>- To save the data, you pipe to another special URL, e.g. `https://my/data | https://other/transform | https://my/data2`</p><p>- A possible mechanism is GET my/data, POST other/transform and then POST my/data2.</p><p>- Auth is handled transparently.</p><p>- 'Built-in' transformers could be provided by special `about:` style URLs.</p><p>- Each URL restricts the schema/format of data you can PUT under it. E.g. I could implement http://my/books/ such that it only accepts specific JSON. This allows a range of services from 'blob store' to <br>'custom database' to be implemented within this scheme. Extending this idea to 'content streams' - a URL could return a stream of content and the transform would apply to each item, you could filter it, etc.</p><p>- Features like 'search' then become just a URL that return a stream of content.</p><p>This does require a wide array of services to provide and consume data in a specific protocol. But if it catches on, and comes with a nicer UI than the JS console, it can becomes quite useful.</p></td></tr>

<tr><td style='padding-left: 50px' colspan='2' class='dMessage'><p>Lots of interesting ideas here!</p><p>One thought I have, looking at your ideas: can all of these be reified as web pages? If you make something into a page it makes it clearer what's happening, and encourages mixing and matching of tools. For instance: what does pipe look like as a web page?</p><p>Another thought: what does abstract vs concrete composition look like? By concrete, I mean performing actions. E.g., go to https://my/data, copy the URL, open https://other/transform, paste the URL into a form, submit. That's the normal way we compose services, and I think we'd want that – normal also means expected, and transparent, and discoverable. Is there a natural bridge from the manual approach to a more structured or automated or describable approach?</p><p>Can we consume the existing streams we have? E.g., take the search services we have available right now, get smart enough to tell what the result links are in the page, and smart enough to understand pagination, and then... we're good? Other services aren't allowed to just scrape Google search results, but other services aren't user agents, we're applying understanding purely (we'd hope!) for the benefit of the user, who after all was always allowed to see the search results.</p><p>Combine reification and operating on existing services, and you get something a little like <a href="http://lmgtfy.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://lmgtfy.com/">http://lmgtfy.com/</a> – not fancy, but just a simple way of sharing not just results, but how the results were attained.</p><p>&gt; This does require a wide array of services to provide and consume data in a specific protocol. But if it catches on, and comes with a nicer UI than the JS console, it can becomes quite useful.</p><p>Do we need new services and protocols? I suspect, if we're assertive enough, that we can discover protocols in the services we already have. But probably we'll need just a little more glue to make it all come together.</p></td></tr>

<tr><td style='padding-left: 100px' colspan='2' class='dMessage'><p>&gt; can all of these be reified as web pages?</p><p>Hmm, perhaps. Things like auth and cross origin policies typically get in the way.</p><p>&gt; Is there a natural bridge from the manual approach to a more structured or automated or describable approach?</p><p>Ah interesting question. Thinking about this, it starts to look like 'macro recording' in some editors and environments. You 'start recording', do your thing, 'stop recording', then view the workflow that you recorded. You then can just rerun or parameterize and rerun with different inputs.</p><p>&gt; Do we need new services and protocols?</p><p>Not strictly, but the issue with the web as-is is discover-ability. For instance how can the browser know which fields an HTTP POST endpoint accepts? If it's a form it may be able to extract that, but what if the data is constructed via javascript? I wasn't thinking of a completely new protocol but a scheme on the existing protocols. For instance a well defined way to authenticate and to determine what format/schema of data can be posted to a URL. This might help if the browser can build a registry of 'urls that accept pictures', and then whenever it has an picture object, allow piping to any of those.</p><p>What I meant with new services is if we have a large number  of third party providers running services using a scheme that is easily integrated into the workflow, with auth and piping stuff around, then the value of the ecosystem becomes much larger. I'm not aware of any services presently. Most are designed for manual operation via custom logins and very specialized web apps.</p></td></tr>

<tr><td style='padding-left: 0px' colspan='2' class='dMessage'><p>While I like the idea that firefox is becoming more of a complete tool, I prefer modularity. That’s why addons exists, no? At its current form, screenshots are redundant component, as it simply isn’t doing enough. I need to annotate, therefore use another extension or <a href="http://snag.gy" rel="nofollow noopener" title="snag.gy">snag.gy</a>. While I don’t hate native firefox screenshots at its current form, I don’t believe adding set if simple annotation options would hurt workflow of anyone, as it would be something you could do after the screen is already uploaded and it would be completely optional extra step. So yeah, “do one thing and do it well” simply ins’t the case for screenshots yet and this reads like you are assuring yourself that the tool in its current form is what majority wants, not you. <a href="http://Snag.gy" rel="nofollow noopener" title="Snag.gy">Snag.gy</a> does one thing, “reasonably” well and it has been around for ages. The whole thing is a website, all I need is a bookmark. I think it is way more elegant, like tools you mentioned — Etherpad.</p><p>It goes with Send, too. Both seems to focus on privacy with no accounts and expiration dates. I imagine this aligns with Mozilla’s way, but it is not terribly convenient. At the same time, garbage like Pocket, Reader+, WebRTC (arguably useful) and Hello went right into the firefox. And you already store my bookmarks, passwords (well not mine, but lot of people opt-in here) via sync, so why not just enrich the experience here. People allow amazon to go inside their house for deliveries, disclose personal and sensitive info everywhere and don’t care about privacy in general. Why can’t I login with my sync account and have granular control? Or the problem is people would take up storage with their screenshots?</p><p>I don’t know, it just feels like Mozilla’s vision/products are split in a way and I already feel like Vivaldi is doing better job on the privacy front. As a user I feel more in control of what components of the ecosystem I use. But that is just me.</p></td></tr>

<tr><td style='padding-left: 50px' colspan='2' class='dMessage'><p>&gt; While I like the idea that firefox is becoming more of a complete tool, I prefer modularity. That’s why addons exists, no?</p><p>Screenshots is an add-on, but unfortunately for boring reasons we couldn't expose it as an installed add-on that you can disable. At least not yet.</p><p>&gt; I need to annotate, therefore use another extension</p><p>BTW, we'll be adding this feature to Screenshots in the next couple months.</p><p>I would have liked if annotation was a separate feature, complementary to but separate from Screenshots. But there's a lot we'd have to figure out to do that, and so we've moved forward in a conventional way, making it a feature built on a feature.</p><p>Similarly, I can see how <a href="http://snag.gy" rel="nofollow noopener" title="snag.gy">snag.gy</a> separates the upload/publish step from the screen capture in an interesting way, where Screenshots combines the two. I like that... but I think we'd need to figure out the metaphors and flows some, and in the interest of moving forward we used more conventional approaches.</p><p>I don't want to suggest that the tools I am imagining don't already exist, or that they each need to be integrated directly into Firefox. I think there's an opportunity to introduce those tools to more people, and complement them with a few tools that don't exist or are quite obscure. (For instance the browser itself can be very non-webby, which is one issue I see.)</p><p>&gt; It goes with Send, too. Both seems to focus on privacy with no accounts and expiration dates</p><p>Expiration dates were put in when Screenshots was an experiment, because... we didn't want to commit to anything long term. Then no one complained, and many people even seemed to appreciate the expiration. I was a bit surprised. The expiration can be extended.</p><p>&gt; Why can’t I login with my sync account and have granular control?</p><p>That feature will be coming too.</p><p>Requiring sign-up to try something out is a pattern we wanted to avoid, so we started with a semi-anonymous mode (there is a sort of Screenshots account tied to your browser profile). People use accounts for lots of different purposes, so we've had a hard time coming up with a unified approach to accounts in Firefox. People are familiar with web logins, but a browser login doesn't quite fit that model, and so far we've reverted to using web logins for additional services even when you are logged into Firefox (which is also how Screenshots will work, at least to start). I'm not happy with it, but it's a morass I don't want to get caught up in right now.</p></td></tr>
