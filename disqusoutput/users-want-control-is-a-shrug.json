Obvious/intuitive, fair, good-quality and sustainable solutions should be presented, in a system that is set up humanely. There should be no \"clever trick\" to getting the right outcome to happen. All comers should be able to arrive at where they're trying to get, do what they're trying to do.</p><p>\"Choice\" and \"control\" are probably best to encounter when the options are of equivalent quality, or where quality isn't an (objective/measurable) factor. But so often \"choice\" and \"options\" are just there to exploit the fact that psychologically, people will agree to a situation that they feel the have chosen for themselves. A person will be less likely to get upset if they choose their own choice of pain out of several different flavors of it. (This analogy brings to my mind choosing a flavor of lollipop at the dentist, or at the doctor's when getting a flu shot.)</p><p>Yes, customization and choice should be present somewhere in a humane system. But it is good to ask \"why\" the choices we see are there. Healthcare in the United States is a series of Catch 22's. In many other developed countries, choosing a doctor (the basic \"choice\" most expect in healthcare) is possible, yet their systems don't suffer from dysfunction and waste like our system does... Notice when \"choice\" is used to distract from, and hide, corruption, placing blame on end-users, and not on shot-callers and grifters who have rigged up each of the options to be either poor-quality or expensive, (or, too often, both!) but generally inadequate for a fair and humane society.</p><p>tl;dr when \"choice\" is used to justify something controversial, first check if most/all the options on offer will be inadequate. Ask who really benefits, all things considered.</p>",

Those are suitable discussion topics. My assertion here is that \"control\" is a very poor lens to discuss those issues.</p><p>There's a ton of concrete things that make it hard to achieve those goals. If you have to change plans and your doctor goes out of network, that's one problem. But there's also a dozen other challenges that are hard to categorize as \"control\" \u2013 for instance, we had to leave a pediatrician we liked because the scheduling system made it impossible to see her on short notice (i.e., with a sick kid). I have a hard time calling that an issue of control.</p><p>Furthermore, \"control\" is a way to avoid the real discussion. Do you want to take seriously the issue of creating and maintaining good doctor relationships? There's a ton to consider there. When you wrap it all up in \"control\" it's a way of letting everyone project their desires into a muddled mess, then use the confusion to reframe those desires into a preexisting agenda. The result is not honest and critical thinking.</p>",
