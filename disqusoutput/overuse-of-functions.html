<tr><td style='padding-left: 0px' colspan='2' class='dMessage'><p>For such small amount of code you wouldn't bother but suppose it's 10 times longer ? I think making better abstractions for the ui would do it. But be generic, not specific - eg: implement a widget for a list of labels instead of a UpdateUserStatusWidget</p></td></tr>

<tr><td style='padding-left: 0px' colspan='2' class='dMessage'><p>The result of this (not ready for prime time) OO meme (for the real deal read Meyer or Holub) is that one ends up with lots and lots o state in instance variables (by various names in various languages).  Keeping track of all that in one's head is tough.  Those with photographic memories probably do OK.  The functional languages exist in contraindication, but have a performance burden.</p><p>When we asked our high school English teacher how long a paper was supposed to be, he said, "organic length".  Too bad for us, since we hadn't a clue.</p><p>The result is that most OO style code ends up being written in the debugger, since that's the only way to keep track of the spaghetti!!</p></td></tr>

<tr><td style='padding-left: 0px' colspan='2' class='dMessage'><p>I've seen this on many an occasion. A few years back I inherited quite a large java (liferay) application where the previous engineer had really taken this to heart. Every class contained a large number of 1 line functions with increasingly complicated naming. Trying to stitch together what was actually going on when a request hit a particular endpoint was a nightmare.</p><p>In our current object oriented languages and frameworks I think it is about finding a middle ground with what structurally makes sense with the concepts of the application and what is practical to maintain.</p><p>I'd also be interested to hear and learn about other language approaches and their (hopefully better) ways of organising logic.</p></td></tr>

<tr><td style='padding-left: 0px' colspan='2' class='dMessage'><p>Would I be wrong to argue that this makes for a particular mess regarding procedural functions? I've recently started digging into functional programming (avoiding state, thinking in values, designing pure and chainable functions) and find it helps reduce complexity and ease control flow so it actually makes sense keeping procedures in single functions. Did that make sense? Anyway, Rich Hickey has more - <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rI8tNMsozo0" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rI8tNMsozo0">http://www.youtube.com/watc...</a></p></td></tr>

<tr><td style='padding-left: 0px' colspan='2' class='dMessage'><p>Wow. I agree. I don't enjoy needing to skip through different functions to figure out what's going on. I find huge functions really easy to debug and follow.</p></td></tr>

<tr><td style='padding-left: 0px' colspan='2' class='dMessage'><p>Very good question. My immediate thought :</p><p>If your refactored code was like this :</p><p>function updateUserStatus() {<br>    var id = "user-"+<a href="http://user.id" rel="nofollow noopener" title="user.id">user.id</a>;<br>    if (user.status == "active") {<br>         addToList("#userlist",<a href="http://user.name" rel="nofollow noopener" title="user.name">user.name</a>,id);<br>    } else {<br>            removeFromList("#userlist",id);<br>     }<br>}</p><p>it would solve most of the problems. You aren't fussily creating extra functions for tiny fragments of functionality which are only relevant to narrow situations (ie. users, userlists).  Now your new functions are more generic and widely applicable. They're doing enough that it's worth the overhead of creating them. They're still usefully hiding the bit of complexity you DON'T want to think about here - the actual jQuery / HTML details of how lists are constructed - while keeping the important details - WHICH list you're updating, what bits of a user you show - in this locality rather than allowing them to become diffuse across your program.</p><p>Of course, you CAN'T prevent another bit of code updating the list itself somewhere. (That's more a quirk of the HTML environment you're working in where the DOM is global. In many analogous cases you could prevent most of the code having unauthorized access to a list simply by making it private within a class.)</p><p>This is a great question though. It's still a classic modularity problem  : how to keep closely related stuff together in one place, and unconnected stuff at arms length / in a substitutable form. But we tend not to have much explicit thinking down at such small granularities (compared to all the patterns for classes etc.)</p></td></tr>
