Implements both and has Anki sync for your flashcards.</p><p>It's a long term personal knowledge repository for your documents.  It's based on Electron and super hackable if you're interested.</p><p><a href="https://getpolarized.io/" rel="nofollow noopener" title="https://getpolarized.io/">https://getpolarized.io/</a></p><p>I'll also hook you up with a premium account if you email me so you can get more cloud storage.</p></td></tr>

<tr><td style='padding-left: 0px' colspan='2' class='dMessage'><p>With regards to "whatever people get from Electron", it's app-like behavior. It's in my app launcher / start menu / desktop. It has its own window, and isn't shared with other browser tabs. I can use OS-specific shortcuts to launch, switch to, and close it.</p><p>And, secondarily, native integration into the OS is nice, too. (Example: An HTML5 audio app displays audio controls on the phone's lockscreen.)</p><p>I believe progressive web apps (PWAs) are the way forward for app-like behavior.</p></td></tr>

<tr><td style='padding-left: 50px' colspan='2' class='dMessage'><p>This this this. I don't want to use cmd-1, cmd-2, etc or ctrl-tab to switch to an app in a browser tab. I want to use cmd-tab to switch to an application.</p><p>Chrome's "Create Shortcut" feature is 90% of the way there, but the "apps" it creates have unusual cmd-tab behavior on macOS, so I'm stuck with Electron apps.</p></td></tr>

<tr><td style='padding-left: 50px' colspan='2' class='dMessage'><p>Also, websites/webapps in the browser, are transient. As in, I only sometimes want to go to them. Even pinned tabs eventually get closed. An app, like Slack, is something that I want to keep open and not connected to my browser.</p><p>There's also a local vs. remote aspect. I expect an app to store things on my device and not to upload things to the web. If I open a webapp in a browser, then I expect it to upload my data to the web. Even if the app supposedly only uses local storage.</p><p>Electron also adds in the ability to code parts of an app in C/C++/etc when Javascript just can't give the performance that is needed.</p><p>I haven't gotten very far learning Electron yet, but one interesting thing is that you can disable remote scripts entirely in an Electron app. You can't do that in a webapp.</p><p>All that said, I do wish Mozilla would release a competitor to Electron. The web is way to dependent on libchromium for comfort right now.</p></td></tr>

Then it generates flashcards for you to review on a spaced repetition-type schedule. No Firefox extension yet, but shouldn't be hard to port over.</p><p>Really impressed with the other experiment proposals! Some really cool ideas.</p></td></tr>

<tr><td style='padding-left: 0px' colspan='2' class='dMessage'><p>"Just Save" looks like something I've been interested in for some time.  I do a lot of stashing of copies of things on disk, but the "File-Save As" dialog is really clunky (and recently has gotten worse on linux-- thanks libgtk) and just using the &lt;title&gt; to get a default file name is pretty weak.</p></td></tr>

Its in the early stages but we're seeing quite a few folks find it useful as we gain feedback from our users.</p></td></tr>
