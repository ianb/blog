<tr><td style='padding-left: 0px' colspan='2' class='dMessage'><p>Nice write-up, really appreciate you sharing your perspective on collaboration in such depth.</p><p>One quick thing I wanted to comment on, Sqwiggle isn’t necessarily about showing emotion to your computer, it’s about providing ambient awareness with your team, letting you know beyond a doubt whether or not the person is at their computer and available.</p><p>Though I would also argue that there is an element of emotion. We have several customers who have told us how great it is to see their team member’s reactions to a gif posted in the stream, or a failed / successful build, etc. It definitely adds more than a simple presence indicator.</p><p>Again, really great write-up!</p></td></tr>
