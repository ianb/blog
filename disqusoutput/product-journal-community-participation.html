<tr><td style='padding-left: 0px' colspan='2' class='dMessage'><p>"Volunteers and employees work at different paces" <br>I think what you mean is that volunteers cannot dedicate the same amount of time to the project.</p><p>Also, you write "The project could be cancelled." but what if there are volunteers that want to keep working on it? Would they be allowed to just pick up the ball? Or would some organizational kink get in their way?</p><p>At the top you write: "But removing barriers to participation doesnâ€™t make participation happen."</p><p>I think if the tool is awesome, people will come, unless there is crazy hand-waving to get anything done.</p><p>If the product isn't awesome, well, volunteers can choose to work on whatever they like.</p><p>The upside is that the volunteers are more likely to try to work smart, and, to your point #2, will not put up with inefficient support systems. They will not trade brawn for brains.</p></td></tr>
