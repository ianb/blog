I realized the providers we ship CAN be localized (to match up with markets like this), but after a quick test I see that the mail providers for the German Firefox build are the same as the default.

<tr><td style='padding-left: 0px' colspan='2' class='dMessage'><p>Edge allows something vaguely like this. You can save a set of tabs for later, and then on each tab set there's a share option, which uses the Windows share contract. Share it to email and it populates a message with a list of links with page titles and thumbnails. I've found it somewhat useful, although it would be a lot better if the Edge set-aside feature existed on mobile and sync'd, and if OneNote had better share target support.</p></td></tr>
