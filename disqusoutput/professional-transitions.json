        "message": "<p>OK. I'd replace \"product\" with \"code\" to make that more true. The product of Netscape, not so much.</p><p>One of the most important points about the creation of m/b (which became Phoenix which became Firefox) was that it wasn't chasing Netscape users like other Netscape/Mozilla efforts at the time, and it didn't try in any way to be a Netscape product or an upgrade or replacement for Netscape products. We were after IE users.</p><p>I'd say that Firefox, as a product, owes as much to IE and Netcaptor as it does to Netscape, perhaps more.</p><p>Alternatively, your statement could simply apply to all browsers released after Netscape. \"Even IE was in some sense really created by Netscape\" would be equally valid since IE was basically a Netscape clone.  Heck as far as that goes, \"Even Firefox was in some sense really created by Netscape\" could be replaced by \"Even Chrome was really created by Apple\" since Chrome was built on much of Apple's tech just like we built Firefox on Mozilla/Netscape tech.</p><p>But a product is not code and Firefox was a product (and project) that had very little to do with Netscape.</p><p>Simply put, Firefox was not a Netscape product. It was the product of a small group of *independent* people, some Netscape employees (and later former employees) and some not, who wanted to take on and beat IE *despite* the existence of a Netscape that didn't care about it, didn't invest in it, and certainly didn't design it.</p><p>But yes, Firefox did use a lot of Mozilla/Netscape code.</p>",

OTOH, you can only \"fail\" when you have clear goals, some clear yardstick of success. So to the extent it helps concretize goals/yardsticks up front, failing often/fast can be valuable, but again only if the lessons of failure can be communicated and utilized.</p>",

        "message": "<p>I think the reason open-source projects aren't great at churning out products (or \"finishing\" them, as you so astutely word it\u2014in the sense of \"polishing\") is that the things that are interesting to work on are orthogonal to the things that make a good product.</p><p>The advantage a hierarchal organization brings to product creation is focus. It's what I enjoy about Apple: sometimes their products aren't for me, but they're always *coherent*. I can see what they were going for. The Apple suite of apps are clearly the best browser, calendar, and mailer for Steve Jobs.</p><p>Likewise, Safari has one focus. It is the browser most at home on the Mac.</p><p>Chrome has one focus. It is the best way to consume Google services.</p><p>Firefox is all over the place right now. Do we provide the best privacy? The best dev tools? The most ambitious web standards? The best integration with our phone? What? We're smart people, each in our area. But being an open source project at heart predisposes us to being a collection of each smart person's favorite features, duct-taped together and given a version number. It's what MS Word was around version 6 (and may still be for all I know): MS managed that project by having each developer come up with and be responsible for his or her own pet feature.</p><p>Don't get me wrong\u2014I love and use a lot of FF features\u2014but it seems like we're throwing things at the wall lately: a Hello button, Panorama, F1, a Social API. Now, I love Hello; I use it all the time. And I think better browser integration with Facebook is a motivating feature that could really net us some users. But I look at Firefox today, and I don't see focus. Who does Firefox want to be the Best Browser for? I have no idea. A Single Guiding Principle would both (1) prioritize our efforts so we can actually complete, polish, ship and support things rather than tossing them behind a toolbar button and forgetting about them and (2) unify our messaging so people know why, beyond a shadow of a doubt, to choose Firefox.</p><p>As for messaging, the \"Doing good is part of our code\" campaign made me proud to work for Mozilla, but it also took me back to Apple's darkest days, when they were putting up billboards saying \"Give your dreams a chance.\" \"Please, guys, don't leave us! Give us another chance!\" Emotional appeals work for soft drinks where there is no product differentiation. But we're not there with browsers yet; there are important differences. In Apple's case, they brought Chiat/Day back onboard, started running some messaging that had teeth, started attacking their competitors directly, and sold themselves to Steve for -$400M, who promptly focused them by cancelling half their product line and doing ballsy things like eliminating floppy drives. The rest is history. They added good UI to music players. Maybe we add privacy to phones. I don't know. But we need to figure it out.</p>",

Firefox notably got beyond that.</p><p>But I also suspect one of the challenges that open source projects have is organizations (or lack thereof) that support the product development \u2013 there is some wisdom in traditional corporate structures, and they support certain kinds of efforts that are hard to achieve without those structures.  There was a lot of corporate effort that helped get early Firefox/Phoenix developers within shooting distance of a product.</p><p>Chrome is interesting as a kind of inverted example: the kind of code that Netscape provided to make Firefox possible is what WebKit/Konqueror provided to make Safari and Chrome possible, but it was Google and Apple that turned it into a successful product.
