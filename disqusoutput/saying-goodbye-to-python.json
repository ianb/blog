I like to call myself a creative developer. I have been a web developer for about as long as I've been a Python developer. And where the creativity is at these days is on the client side more so than the server side, so that's where I went.</p><p>Back before I even heard of Backbone let alone the wave of Angular and Ember and React and such, I started Obviel, which was to me a fascinating exercise in porting sever-side web framework concepts to the client and seeing what happens. It hasn't gained much traction, but I learned a lot, and I think there are some ideas in there that I want to do more with.</p><p>Strangely enough I find myself back writing Python code again, trying to express what I've learned about web frameworks in a last 15 years or so in a compact form, Morepath. I'm excited about it. But I expect I'll be pulled back to the client again soon, and there are ideas I want to explore, so that is good. And Morepath is a web framework that intends to serve the modern rich-client web application that I've gained much experience over the last years.</p><p>I've found it hard to find a clear community in the JavaScript world myself; it's a more multi-polar world than Python, but ideas do spread through it. I greatly enjoyed <a href=\"http://JSConf.eu\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" title=\"JSConf.eu\">JSConf.eu</a> last year however. Perhaps we will, indeed, meet again sometime. I hope so!</p>",
