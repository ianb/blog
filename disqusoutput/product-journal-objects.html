<tr><td style='padding-left: 0px' colspan='2' class='dMessage'><p>Very interesting.</p><p>An "elephant in the room" -- there are already organizations/systems which spend a lot of intelligence trying to automatically understand web pages as objects -- namely, Google and other search engines. They succeeded well enough to make the web vastly more useful, even when all they inferred from each object was its links to other objects.</p><p>Of course that is really just about pages being "data", whose representation is only semi-formal. (But then, understood data, when active in someone's mind, can redirecting their attention, give them understanding, reference something in the real world, etc. So it is not as inactive as it seems.)</p><p>Your analogy asks us to look for ways in which existing web pages are *active like an object in OO*, e.g. as interfaces to services with state. (This reminds me of a new thing I noticed recently (which you are probably familiar with), Swagger, which lets REST APIs be semi-formally described and become discoverable.)</p><p>I can't think of anything which has automatically understood existing web pages as OO objects nearly as successfully as Google has understood them as data. (I also think there is currently a lot less there to discover, than there is in simply viewing them as data about the world -- in that, we have still only scratched the surface.)</p></td></tr>
