Just as mobsters and drug lords get convicted of tax evasion, if people on the web could be come authors of works, copyright may be a means to enforce privacy.</p><p>Anyway... just thinking aloud :)</p>",

Twitter isn't innovating on site summaries, so they can wait for the market to respond (and if the market doesn't respond then they don't really care).  I think most innovation comes from the careful use of existing resources, not aching for things that don't exist and you can't implement yourself.</p><p>I'm not actually excited about test recording (but I am excited about cobrowsing), I just see it as one possibility.  If you just compare what I propose to Selenium's IDE, the tooling is (potentially) simpler (to the degree cobrowsing is already \"done\" \u2013 but that's the whole premise), the result is not bound to any one testing tool (except admittedly the cobrowser) and it is more intrinsically cloud-based (for better or worse), since the easiest form of export is to collaborate with a service.  Test recording isn't very interesting because it's fragile and only works when you've finished the product so you can record something.  Automation is much more interesting (e.g., to build a scraping tool out of a parameterized recording).</p>",
