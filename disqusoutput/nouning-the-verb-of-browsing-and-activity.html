<tr><td style='padding-left: 0px' colspan='2' class='dMessage'><p>I'd wonder if there is a case to be made that data produced in this context makes the user an author of sorts. If that were the case, could stealing the result be considered copyright infringement? That might sound scary, but if the work created from a browsing session could be copyrighted, then someone stealing that work (*cough* NSA *cough*) could be prosecuted for copyright infringement!</p><p>I'm probably misunderstanding how copyright works, but it makes you wonder how the web could change if the users had more ownership. Just as mobsters and drug lords get convicted of tax evasion, if people on the web could be come authors of works, copyright may be a means to enforce privacy.</p><p>Anyway... just thinking aloud :)</p></td></tr>

<tr><td style='padding-left: 0px' colspan='2' class='dMessage'><p>Selenium has had a recorder for browser events (in the name of test automation) for quite some time: <a href="http://www.seleniumhq.org/projects/ide/" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://www.seleniumhq.org/projects/ide/">http://www.seleniumhq.org/p...</a></p><p>This *helps* get a test going quicker, but still takes some work to make a resilient test.</p><p>While there can be value in thinking "I have data X (or technology Z), what can I do with it?" I think it's generally better to come at things the other way: "I need to do Y, how can I get the data to make that possible?". Take Microformats... Twitter wanted to be able to embed a nice summary of a link on their site, so they created a microformat that they can read to get a summary. Because Twitter is a big site and the use case is reasonably compelling, there are sites that now include cards.</p></td></tr>

<tr><td style='padding-left: 50px' colspan='2' class='dMessage'><p>I think Twitter is an anti-example: if the answer to "how do I get summaries" is "become gigantic" then there's no real room for innovation.  Twitter isn't innovating on site summaries, so they can wait for the market to respond (and if the market doesn't respond then they don't really care).  I think most innovation comes from the careful use of existing resources, not aching for things that don't exist and you can't implement yourself.</p><p>I'm not actually excited about test recording (but I am excited about cobrowsing), I just see it as one possibility.  If you just compare what I propose to Selenium's IDE, the tooling is (potentially) simpler (to the degree cobrowsing is already "done" â€“ but that's the whole premise), the result is not bound to any one testing tool (except admittedly the cobrowser) and it is more intrinsically cloud-based (for better or worse), since the easiest form of export is to collaborate with a service.  Test recording isn't very interesting because it's fragile and only works when you've finished the product so you can record something.  Automation is much more interesting (e.g., to build a scraping tool out of a parameterized recording).</p></td></tr>
