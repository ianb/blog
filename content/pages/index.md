Title: Ian Bicking: a home page
Slug: index

You've reached my homepage on the world wide web.  Hello!

On the internet I'm a computer programmer.  Not on the internet I am also a computer programmer, but I also have a [wife](http://emilymurphy.com) and daughter. I live in Minneapolis, in the Powderhorn Park neighborhood.  On the internet I live here; when I used to say things I'd say them on [Google+](https://plus.google.com/+IanBicking/posts), but in a fit of counter-culture obstinance I switched to a [Facebook Page](https://www.facebook.com/ibicking).  I'm on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ianbicking) but it just mirrors.

I work for [Mozilla](http://www.mozilla.org/).  You can read more about what I'm doing on my [**projects page**](/projects.html).
