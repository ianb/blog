Title: Ian Bicking: a home page
Slug: index

You've reached my homepage on the world wide web. Hello!

On the internet I'm a computer programmer. Not on the internet I am also a computer programmer, but I also have a [wife](http://emilymurphy.com) and two daughters. I live in Minneapolis, in the Powderhorn Park neighborhood. On the internet I live here; on social media I am active on [Mastodon](https://hachyderm.io/@ianbicking), [Blue Sky](https://bsky.app/profile/ianbicking.org), a little on [Threads](https://www.threads.net/@ibicking).

I worked at Mozilla for 10 years until 2020, Meta Reality Labs until 2022, and Brilliant.org until 2024. You can read more about what I'm doing on my [**projects page**](/projects.html).

<!-- As of December 2024 I am currently [looking for work](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7265435901009231872/). I really [enjoy working with LLMs](/projects.html#llm), and I believe there is important work to be done at this moment; I want to find people who feel the same and are approaching this moment with both ambition and care. -->

Not online, my mobile number is **773-870-0645**, and I will rely on you to use that appropriately (never really been a problem so far; I guess cold calling is too scary). And my address is **3015 10th Ave. S, Minneapolis, MN 55407**.
