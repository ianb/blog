Doing stuff with the Atom Publishing Protocol, I've noticed that it goes by two (shortened) names: APP and Atompub.  I'd become used to calling it APP, but I've decided to make a conscious effort to call it Atompub from now on, and I encourage you all to do the same.  You cannot usefully search for "APP", and it's pronunciation is ambiguous.  Atompub is a much better name.

And as long as we're `talking about names <https://ianbicking.org/2007/08/02/pronouncing-django />`_, I'll note that the `Cheese Shop is now called PyPI again <http://mail.python.org/pipermail/catalog-sig/2007-July/001460.html>`_.  I *think* we are supposed to pronounce it *pih-pee*, distinct from `PyPy <http://codespeak.net/pypy />`_ which is pie-pie.  (Blast, PyPI is down; the Zope guys have been making a static stripped-down mirror for use with Setuptools, `over here <http://download.zope.org/ppix />`_)
