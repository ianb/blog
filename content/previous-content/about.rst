Hi, I'm `Ian Bicking <https://ianbicking.org>`_.  I work at `The Open Planning Project <http://topp.openplans.org>`_.  I do lots of programming in Python.  I keep a `list of projects I participate in <https://ianbicking.org/cv.html#open-source-projects>`_, though I don't always update it.  Lots of stuff in `svn.colorstudy.com <http://svn.colorstudy.com>`_ and `svn.pythonpaste.org <http://svn.pythonpaste.org>`_ is written by me.
