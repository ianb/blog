Joining Mozilla

As of last week, I am now an employee of Mozilla!  Thanks to everyone who helped me out during my job search.

I'll be working both with the Mozilla `Web Development (webdev) <http://blog.mozilla.com/webdev />`_ team, and `Mozilla Labs <https://mozillalabs.com />`_.

The first thing I'll be working on is deployment.  In part because I've been `thinking about deployment lately <https://ianbicking.org/category/silverlining />`_, in part because streamlining deployment is just generally enabling of other work (and a personal itch to be scratched), and because I think there is the possibility to fit this work into Mozilla's `general mission <http://www.mozilla.org/causes />`_, specifically *Empowering people to do new and unanticipated things on the web*.  I think the way I'm approaching deployment has real potential to combine the discipline and benefits of good development practices with an accessible process that is more *democratic* and less *professionalized*.  This is some of what `PHP has provided <https://ianbicking.org/2008/01/12/what-php-deployment-gets-right />`_ over the years (and I think it's been a genuinely positive influence on the web as a result); I'd like to see the same kind of easy entry using other platforms.  I'm hoping `Silver Lining <http://cloudsilverlining.org>`_ will fit both Mozilla's application deployment needs, as well as serving a general purpose.

Once I *finish* deployment and can move on (oh fuck what am I getting myself into) I'll also be working with the `web development group <http://blog.mozilla.com/webdev>`_ who has adopted Python for many of their new projects (e.g., `Zamboni <http://github.com/jbalogh/zamboni>`_, a rewrite of the `addons.mozilla.org <https://addons.mozilla.org />`_ site), and with Mozilla Labs on `Weave <http://mozillalabs.com/weave />`_ or some of their other projects.

In addition my own `Python open source work <http://ianbicking.appspot.com/projects>`_ is in line with Mozilla's mission and I will be able to continue spending time on those projects, as well as entirely new projects.

I'm pretty excited about this -- it feels like there's a really good match with Mozilla and what I'm good at, and what I care about, and *how* I care about it.
