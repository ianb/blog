                In followup to my previous
                <a class="reference" href="on-form-libraries.html"
                    >post on form generators</a
                >, I thought I'd note some implementation details of the
                pipeline approach I advocate there.
            </p>
            <p>
                So, one thing I proposed is that we have some notion of
                requiring some Javascript or CSS from within an HTML element.
                Let's say it looks like:
                <tt class="docutils literal"
                    ><span class="pre">&lt;input</span>
                    <span class="pre">type=&quot;date&quot;</span>
                    <span class="pre"
                        >js-require=&quot;DateSelect&quot;&gt;</span
                    ></tt
                >. There's a function
                <tt class="docutils literal"
                    ><span class="pre">find_library_url(name,</span>
                    <span class="pre">type)</span></tt
                >, called in this case like
                <tt class="docutils literal"
                    ><span class="pre">find_library_url('DateSelect',</span>
                    <span class="pre">'js')</span></tt
                >, and it returns something like
                <tt class="docutils literal"
                    ><span class="pre"
                        >&quot;http://localhost:8080/static/js/DateSelect.js&quot;</span
                    ></tt
                >
                (we won't worry about how it is implemented).
            </p>
            <p>
                Here's how you could do this transformation using
                <a class="reference" href="http://codespeak.net/lxml/">lxml</a>:
            </p>
            <pre class="literal-block">
from lxml import etree
from urlparse import urljoin

def resolve_js_require(doc, doc_url, find_library_url):
    if isinstance(doc, basestring):
        doc = etree.HTML(doc)
    script_hrefs = set()
    for el in doc.xpath('//*[&#64;js-require]'):
        name = el.attrib['js-require']
        del el.attrib['js-require']
        url = find_library_url(name, 'js')
        script_hrefs.add(url)
    # Check that we aren't duplicating any explicit &lt;script&gt; tags:
    for el in doc.xpath('//script[&#64;src]'):
        url = urljoin(doc_url, el.attrib['src'])
        if url in script_hrefs:
            script_hrefs.remove(url)
    try:
        head = doc.xpath('//head')[0]
    except IndexError:
        # No &lt;head&gt;
        head = etree.Element('head')
        doc.insert(0, head)
    # Add in the &lt;script&gt; tags:
    for url in script_hrefs:
        el = etree.Element('script')
        el.attrib['type'] = 'text/javascript'
        el.attrib['src'] = url
        head.append(el)
    return doc
</pre
            >
            <p>
                Extending this for CSS is hopefully obvious. You can see the
                code with an explanatory doctest in
                <a
                    class="reference"
                    href="http://svn.colorstudy.com/home/ianb/recipes/jsrequire.py"
                    >my recipe repository</a
                >. Hopefully this example seems easy enough that people will see
                the benefit of the technique. lxml is a great library, and would
                be great for cleaning up the implementation of things like
                <a
                    class="reference"
                    href="http://formencode.org/formencode/htmlfill.py.html"
                    >the HTMLParser-based monstrosity</a
                >
                of
                <a class="reference" href="http://formencode.org/htmlfill.html"
                    >htmlfill</a
                >. (Note: do <em>not</em> use
                <a
                    class="reference"
                    href="http://python.org/doc/current/lib/module-HTMLParser.html"
                    >HTMLParser</a
                >, it's not worth the effort.)

                    This approach looks very interesting, I like it. I gather
                    that this could be implemented in a layer of middleware
                    who's sole responsability would be to handle static
                    resource's dependencies, insert their links at &lt;head&gt;

                <p>
                    It think would be useful to agree in a protocol to pass the
                    element stream through the stack so it plays nice with other
                    XML transforming middleware so the markup only needs to be
                    parsed and serialized once, with any number of
                    transformations in between (Deliverance, etc...) I remember
                    some discussion along this lines in
                    <a

                    ToscaWidgets could piggy back on this to handle its static
                    resources needs. Which brings up the idea that some sort of
                    central registry to map
                    <tt class="docutils literal"
                        ><span class="pre">js-require</span></tt
                    >
                    (and
                    <tt class="docutils literal"
                        ><span class="pre">css-require</span></tt
                    >) attribute values to files in the filesystem so any
                    library used by a downstream app could regsiter their
                    resources so they can be served and their urls generated.
                    Maybe something like this?:
                </p>
                <pre class="literal-block">
class MochiKitIter(object):
    type = &quot;javascript&quot;
    depends_on = [&quot;MK-Base&quot;, ...]
    location = resource_filename(__name__, &quot;static/Iter.js&quot;)
</pre
                >
                <p>
                    with a
                    <tt class="docutils literal"
                        ><span class="pre">foobar.resource_provider</span></tt
                    >
                    entrypoint that mapped
                    <tt class="docutils literal"
                        ><span class="pre"
                            >js-require=&quot;MK-Iter&quot;</span

                    to this object.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It would also be a natural place to implement the
                    &quot;js/css packaging&quot; ideas discussed

                    <p>
                        Yes, that's possible. I would be reluctant to put too
                        much in middleware, but this particular case requires
                        very little context. Combining a server with
                        <tt class="docutils literal"
                            ><span class="pre">find_library_url</span></tt

                        would also make sense. Or you could have a configured
                        system that copies resources into a different location,
                        e.g., where they are served by Apache or some faster
                        server, and then make
                        <tt class="docutils literal"
                            ><span class="pre">find_library_url</span></tt
                        >
                        know about that. That there's multiple useful
                        implementations is part of what makes me like the
                        design.

                        interested; I'll probably just move the implementation
                        back into HTTPEncode when I have time.

                    <p>
                        Clearly the nature of that naming becomes pretty
                        important; you want to avoid clashes, but seek out
                        correct overlap. I'm more inclined to use something like
                        OpenJSAN, as it represents a kind of central repository
                        with unique names. Another option is to use some kind of
                        URL/URI, which generally speaking is probably better.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It often annoys me that entry points can't be applied to
                        non-Python objects, like a directory or resource in the
                        package. It might be nice to use a URI, but actually
                        tell the system that the content is provided locally.
                        Then you get better chance of overlap (if two packages
                        require MochiKit, for instance), but you don't make the
                        installation process more complicated (by actually
                        requiring the install to fetch the libraries, for
                        instance).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If going down this track, it would be nice to provide
                        some setuptools extensions for it. E.g.,
                        <tt class="docutils literal"
                            ><span class="pre">python</span>
                            <span class="pre">setup.py</span>

                        It's finicky and difficult to program to. The streaming
                        model doesn't make sense for this set of problems
                        either. If you are using HTML that is frequently found
                        in the wild it fails in lots of ways. You may not
                        encounter these problems from testing, but they can
                        occur later as you expand the sources of content you are
                        dealing with.

                    html5lib is probably a better bet than lxml, simply because
                    it's pure python and hence easier to install. I'm not sure
                    what your problems with HTMLParser are but I imagine
                    html5lib fixes them.

                        On Linux systems lxml is generally very easy to install.
                        They also distribute

                    <p>
                        I don't know about the particulars of how the libxml2
                        parser works, but it seems to do quite well -- I've had
                        very few problems. html5lib is probably more consistent
                        and reliable, though I would be surprised if libxml2
                        didn't also pursue all the same techniques. We have had
                        some threading problems with lxml, which have been quite
                        difficult, though I think they only arose when we
                        started sharing the documents between threads.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In terms of speed lxml is going to beat html5lib easily,
                        since there's many high-level operations written in C.
                        It also gives you a document, not just a parser. Passing
                        this document around will be both simpler and faster
                        than parsing/rewriting/serializing a page. I also find
                        the document more convenient than ElementTree, mostly
                        because nodes know about their parents.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If I was writing a spider, web client, or something else
                        that didn't parse content <em>during</em> a web request,
                        html5lib would be more attractive. For this use case --
                        a parsing and rewriting for every request -- I'd be
                        worried about the performance.

                    I've been thinking about getting lxml into the mix with it
                    for some time. The important bits of Twiddler for me are:
                </p>
                <ul class="simple">
                    <li>
                        simple api for manipulating the content you're
                        generating. No templating languages, not funky ways of
                        doing things, just simple python manipulating a simple
                        object model. Probably the only thing I'm missing is
                        being able to search with xpath for nodes.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        seperate input parser and output renderer, making things
                        ever so much more flexible. Of course, sensible defaults
                        are provided so you don't have to worry about this
                        unless you want to.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    I'd be very interested in your thoughts on it, and how it
                    fits with your pipeline generation model...
                </p>
                <p>
                    I hope this blog mails me if you reply, I'd hate to miss an
                    interesting discussion...
