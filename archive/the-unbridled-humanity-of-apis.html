                    >a counter from the Smalltalk guy</a
                >. But I think the Java guy has a point: 78 methods on your list
                objects isn't good. Less methods is good. Unless the result is
                stupid. Now, let's be honest here, Java is stupid. Dumb,
                idiotic, maybe written by people who aren't programmers; I just
                don't know how else to make sense of it.

                should be embarrassing.

                or
                <tt class="docutils literal"
                    ><span class="pre">list[-1]</span></tt
                >? I think
                <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">[-1]</span></tt>
                reads well enough, and fits into a very elegant set of
                functionality involving slices and whatnot. But I also think
                <tt class="docutils literal"
                    ><span class="pre">list.last</span></tt
                >
                is entirely justifiable. OTOH,
                <tt class="docutils literal"
                    ><span class="pre">list.get(0)</span></tt
                >
                <em>isn't</em> embarrassing, so
                <tt class="docutils literal"
                    ><span class="pre">list.first</span></tt
                >
                isn't as compelling. And the
                <a
                    class="reference"
                    href="http://www.ruby-doc.org/core/classes/Array.html#M000413"
                    >nitems method</a
                >
                he points to really seems overboard. There needs to be a limit
                somewhere.
                <tt class="docutils literal"
                    ><span class="pre">2.years</span>
                    <span class="pre">+</span>

                ... I don't know if I can really get behind that (BTW, that's
                not built in to Ruby, but it can be extended to do that).
            </p>
            <p>
                Maybe an interesting parallel is 0 vs. 1 indexing. 1 clearly
                seems more humane. I personally count starting from 1. I'm
                naturally inclined to index from 1. Languages go both ways on
                the choice.
            </p>
            <p>
                <em>But</em>, while 1 indexing is more humane, 0 indexing is
                consistent with a set of useful properties. Programming is both
                narrative <em>and</em> mathematics, and when the two are in
                conflict it's hard to say which one is right. But experience
                <em>can</em> tell us which is right. 0 is right.
            </p>
            <p>
                Mathematicians are inclined towards minimalism. But mere
                minimalism does not make something mathematically sound or
                reasonable. Mathematics is a sensible argument for 0 indexing.
                But mathematics has nothing to say about the number of methods
                on containers.
            </p>
            <p>
                Not accounting for good container handling in your language is
                stupid. Stupid, stupid, stupid. If you are clever, you can make
                it seem like container handling just <em>falls</em> out of your
                more fundamental constructs. Smalltalk does this well. But don't
                be fooled -- an otherwise similarly elegent system that didn't
                work well with containers would have been discarded. The
                Smalltalk designers were playing the same tricks mathematicians
                play; when you look at a mathematic proof you think
                <em
                    >how elegent, how simple, and how indecipherably attained.
                    If I strive for simplicity, work from just a few axioms,
                    will I achieve the same thing?</em
                >
                <strong>No!</strong> Because there's lots of notes and failed
                attempts and crude proofs the mathematician <em>didn't</em> show
                you (it would be fascinating to see what Smalltalk 76 actually
                looked like). Java is like someone looking at a proof and
                thinking that they will write down theorems starting from simple
                axioms and get something good out of the other end. But they
                didn't realize that the (talented) mathematician deduces an
                interesting <em>outcome</em> and creates the proof as a bridge
                to that outcome. Missing this, the Java designers created
                something stupid and crude. They created something that had all
                the trappings of good design, with none of the outcomes that
                drive good designers.
            </p>
            <p>
                Of course Smalltalk indexes from 1, so no one gets everything
                right.

                    Whatever your feeling is about Java, saying it is stupid is
                    really not a smart thing to say. You spread oil on the
                    flames. Instead of trying to decrease the gap between the
                    two communities you just end up giving a bad image of the
                    Python community to the Java world. Now that is stupid IMO.

                        I think sometimes people mistake poor language design
                        for problems with static typing. One class of problems
                        is structural, and represents specific priorities with
                        respect to the programmer and architect. But many parts
                        of Java just show poor language design. Not giving
                        containers (quality) first class syntax is just a design
                        problem, there's nothing fundamental about it. So I call
                        it stupid, because I think containers are pretty damn
                        useful.
