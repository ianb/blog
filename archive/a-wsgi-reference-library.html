            <p>
                I posted this idea to the
                <a class="reference" href="http://www.python.org/sigs/web-sig/"
                    >Web-SIG</a
                >
                list, but didn't get much response (except from James Gardner,
                the author of
                <a class="reference" href="http://www.pythonweb.org/"
                    >pythonweb</a
                >). But then, that list is kind of weird -- sometimes when
                topics come up I think everyone just happens to be paying
                attention to other things. Or at least, if <em>I'm</em> the one
                who brings up Topics Important To Me and I don't get a response,
                I make myself feel better by thinking that ;) And then I repeat
                myself here...
            </p>
            <p>
                What do people think about collaborating on a kind of
                &quot;standard&quot; library of WSGI middleware? (Not standard
                like distributed-with-Python, just well publicized.) This is
                what I've tried to put together a little with
                <a
                    class="reference"
                    href="http://wiki.webwareforpython.org/wsgikit.html"
                    >WSGIKit</a
                >, though not all parts of it would apply. And other people are,
                I think, starting to develop the same things, perhaps with some
                overlap. Maybe we can pool our efforts together.
            </p>
            <p>The criteria I'd consider for components in this library:</p>
            <ul class="simple">
                <li>
                    Should be something we could do Right, i.e., can become
                    &quot;complete&quot;. E.g., a proxying WSGI application
                    could be complete. A commenting system can't.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Shouldn't involve much UI. Mostly because it can't be very
                    complete.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Shouldn't be tied to anything very specific. E.g., if
                    there's a templating middleware (um, don't ask me exactly
                    what that would look like) it shouldn't be bound to any
                    particular templating language. The specific bindings to
                    specific templating languages should probably be part of the
                    upstream libraries. (Except maybe some reference bindings)
                </li>
                <li>
                    Provides robust architecture more than a pleasant API. E.g.,
                    WSGIKit implements
                    <a class="reference" href="http://webwareforpython.org"
                        >Webware</a
                    >
                    (more or less), but when you use that you see very little of
                    the middleware that WSGIKit uses. And that middleware looks
                    kind of ugly from an API perspective, what with the
                    environment and its string keys and the sometimes funny
                    semantics that WSGI implies.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Be really well documented and stable (at least once we come
                    to consensus on an interface), so that people could reliably
                    and easily used these middleware components in their
                    frameworks.
                </li>
                <li>Testable and tested.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Some candidates I imagine:</p>
            <ul class="simple">
                <li>Sessions middleware</li>
                <li>
                    Logging middleware/library (based on the standard library of
                    course)
                </li>
                <li>Error reporting middleware/library</li>
                <li>Test frameworks (?)</li>
                <li>
                    A file application (handling
                    <tt class="docutils literal"
                        ><span class="pre">If-Modified-Since</span></tt
                    >, etc)
                </li>
                <li>A proxy application</li>
                <li>
                    Libraries for parsing query strings and all that. Most of
                    what is in Phillip's
                    <a
                        class="reference"
                        href="http://cvs.eby-sarna.com/wsgiref/"
                        >wsgiref</a
                    >.
                </li>
                <li>Authentication (this would be on the ambitious end)</li>
                <li>
                    URL parsers (several, but maybe we could distill this down
                    to a few primary models for parsing)
                </li>
                <li>
                    And maybe a few of the more boring servers, like the CGI
                    server, which will otherwise be homeless (or widely
                    repeated).
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                I'd expect everyone involved in this project have ulterior
                motives, i.e., they'd all have their own separate pet projects
                and whatnot, and wouldn't be looking to this library (alone) to
                solve all their needs. And that would be good, another part of
                what would keep this from being Yet Another Framework.

                    You're spot on about the mailing-list, at least in my case.
                    Too busy. Not to mention the general expectation in OSS
                    discussions: if you open your mouth, expect to get assigned
                    more work. :)

                    Although I'd like to see some standardized middleware, I'm
                    more interested <em>at this stage</em> of WSGI to get the
                    major servers on board (Apache 2 being first on my list).
                    But you didn't hear that from me; I have enough to do on
                    those &quot;other projects&quot;.

                    Better applications means more motivation for better
                    servers. Or vice versa -- either way, working on one doesn't
                    keep anyone from working on the other; quite the contrary!
                    And because WSGI is a stable target for both sides, they can
                    work happily and safely in parallel.

                        FastCGI is orthogonal to WSGI. WSGI is a way Python
                        applications and servers can communicate
                        <em>in the same process</em>. The &quot;server&quot; may
                        just be something accepting FastCGI connections, or
                        might be a real HTTP server, or whatever. So WSGI is an
                        internal API, not a protocol.
