</div><h1>A WSGI Stack</h1>
 <p>

Phillip Eby posted another revision of <a href="http://mail.python.org/pipermail/web-sig/2004-August/000562.html">the
Web Server Gateway Interface (WSGI)</a> spec, and it's pretty much
ready to be proposed as a PEP and be discussed more widely.

<p>

So I was thinking about WSGI middleware (extending my <a href="http://blog.colorstudy.com/ianb/weblog/2004/08/18.html#P148">previous
thoughts</a>).  WSGI specifies a fairly simple interface between a
"server" and an "application".  The application in turn can be a
server to another application; thus it would be middleware.  It would
be cool to implement <a href="http://webwareforpython.org">Webware</a>
as a stack of such middleware: each piece would be small, easily
understood and debugged; parts could be shared with others (or taken
from other projects); smaller pieces are easier to understand, and the
code flow is very specific.  If I was to take everything Webware does
now and turn it into these middleware components, this is what I think
I'd get:

<p>

1.  The AppServer.  This is a threaded server that accepts connections
(both a special FastCGI-like protocol and HTTP), spawns a thread for
the request, and passes the request on.

<p>

2. Configuration handler.  I don't know exactly where this comes in,
but I want to configure all these pieces together, but also include
URL-specific configuration.  So the configuration has to be involved
in this chain of middleware.

<p>


3. An exception catcher.  This will catch any exceptions in the
application, log them, email them, provide post-mortem debugging
information, display a pretty traceback, etc.

<p>

4. A session handler.  This will look for any session variables, and
create a session object if needed.  It will put the session object in
the <tt>environ</tt> dictionary (<tt>webkit.session</tt>).

<p>

5. A URL parser/resource finder.  This is <tt>URLParser</tt> in
Webware CVS.  It looks on the disk to find a file (as well as looking
at other hooks).  Once it finds a file or some resource, it finds a
factory (based on extension or some other metadata) and uses the
factory to create an application.

<p>

6. A ServletFactory which talks WSGI.  This moves things like the
creation of <tt>HTTPRequest</tt> further back in the process.

<p>

The interesting part of this is that a lot of this isn't very
Webware-specific at all.  Step 6 is very specific to Webware, but the
rest isn't.  Pieces can also be swapped out.  For instance, I'd
actually like to change this, as I think Webware spawns a thread too
early -- I suspect threads and sockets interact poorly on some
platforms, causing the occasional lockup.  Redhat and FreeBSD seem to
have problems.  So I'd swap out #1 for:

<p>

1a.  An async server.  Either <a href="http://www.amk.ca/python/code/medusa.html">Medusa</a> or <a href="http://www.twistedmatrix.com/">Twisted</a>.  Medusa is smaller,
Twisted better; once the Twisted stuff I'm interested is available
separately (which is planned), then it would probably be an easier
choice.

<p>

1b.  A threading middleware.  It takes the async request that 1a
generates, and uses a threadpool to make it multithreaded, handling
whatever buffering or interaction it needs to do.

<p>

There's other pieces that can be recombined.  For instance, the
URLParser could redirect the request to any WSGI application, not just
Webware servlets.  The exception catcher could be developed
separately, and should work just fine with any stack.  Each piece
could reasonably have multiple implementations.  This seems like a
good way to compose a framework.

 And, don't forget that WebWare users would also be able to switch out 1, 1a, and 1b for something else altogether, like mod_python or PEAK's FastCGI runner, once they support WSGI.

Of course, that's assuming that the other pieces in your stack support a multi-process execution model as well as the single process, multi-thread modes.  But even if they don't, the web server can be any single-process multi-thread WSGI server or gateway.

 Webware stuff generally expects a single-process, multi-threaded model.  But most of those things could be made neutral, though there are a lot of Webware applications that assume a multi-threaded environment (e.g., they store global information in global variables).

 The python threading model is broken, it's about time we fix it:

(I know that stackless implements part of the csp model, but stackless has lots of other stuff I don't want, and stackless is not CPython that is what I want to use)
