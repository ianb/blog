                >. Isn't Guido allowed to speculate and offer some ideas without
                people predicting that Python is utterly doomed? It's not like
                static typing could possibly, even given community consensus,
                happen for several years. And there's clearly not community
                consensus.

                So relax, nothing bad is going to happen. I guess people are a
                little spooked by the
                <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">&#64;</span></tt>
                thing, which seemed abrupt. But even then there was a big
                discussion, and that was for something with a far, far smaller
                impact on the language. It's much more helpful just to talk
                about the issue of typing. It can't be good for Guido's thought
                process if he's unable to float an idea without it turning into
                such an emotional situation.

                    Why not? The design hasn't been fleshed out yet, but once
                    that is done, and it doesn't break any existing code, then
                    it could be here quite soon. Especially considering that
                    Guido is apparently interested in this (as opposed to a
                    feature he doesn't care much about).

                Guido doesn't sound like he's asking for opinions on the
                desirability of a static type option. That decision appears
                made. He's pretty clearly asking for opinions on implementation.

                    Here, here! Everyone is flying off the hilt here on this
                    one. I wish people would just calm down. This has not even
                    gone to python-dev yet, let alone to a PEP. All Guido has
                    done is ask for the AST branch to be finished and while a
                    requirement for the ideas he is throwing out there it needed
                    to be done anyway. This is all just a brain dump by Guido to
                    his blog.
