<div class="document">
<p>One thing that <a class="reference" href="http://pythonpaste.org">Paste</a> has in it is a
command to create a set of files for a new project.  The idea of this
(admittedly borrowed directly from Rails) is to strongly encourage
people to use a common set of conventions.</p>
<p>But, of course, the conventions should be good!  So, what should an
application look like (at least a Paste app, but maybe any web app)?  Here's my
current thoughts (files that are only meaningful for Webware-ish
applications are marked with <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">*</span></tt>):</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
ProjectName/
    setup.py
    ProjectName.egg-info/
        ?
    projectname/
        __init__.py
        app_config.conf
        sample_config.conf
        sitepage.py      *
        web/             *
            sample.py    *
        templates/
            standard_template.XXX
            sample.XXX
        resources/
            stylesheet.css
    doc/
        ProjectName.txt
</pre>
<p>The aspect that's specific to Webware (and Wareweb) is a directory of
servlets and an abstract application-specific superclass for those
servlets.  Everything else feels reasonably standard to me.  We don't
have completely standard names, but the ideas are the same across frameworks.  And some
systems have more or different hierarchy --
a <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">models</span></tt> package, for instance -- but that's really an aside to
this, just like <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">web</span></tt> is an aside.</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">resources/</span></tt> is where static associated files go (I don't like the
name, but eh).  These can potentially be mapped into someplace where
Apache can serve them directly, or Paste can serve them for
expedience.</p>
<p>The configuration changes a bit from the current Paste standard.  In
practice there's a few kinds of
configuration.  One is the application configuring itself for Paste --
to tell Paste what kind of application it is (e.g., the framework), where
some basic files are, what some defaults are for the application-specific
configuration.  This is in
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">app_config.conf</span></tt>, and is shared by all application instances.</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">sample_config.conf</span></tt> is basis for a configuration file that
describes one installation of an application.  <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">app_config.conf</span></tt>
would be loaded first, and the instance configuration file can
override anything it wants.  This describes one fully-instantiated
WSGI application.</p>
<p>The last bit of configuration is the deployment configuration.  This
is the server/app hookup, though it can be more than that, like you
might simply put the application into a server process that is already
running other applications (using <a class="reference" href="http://pythonpaste.org/docs/reference.html#class-urlmap">paste.urlmap</a>).</p>
<p>This also adds a <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">setup.py</span></tt>, which I hadn't used before.  In the past I have
avoided installing applications as globally-importable code, because
of versioning issues and because it didn't seem that useful.  With
<a class="reference" href="http://peak.telecommunity.com/DevCenter/PythonEggs">Eggs</a> and
<a class="reference" href="http://peak.telecommunity.com/DevCenter/EasyInstall">easy_install</a>/<a class="reference" href="http://peak.telecommunity.com/DevCenter/setuptools">setuptools</a> the versioning
is no longer an issue, and the way deployment works with setuptools is
finally starting to click for me.</p>
<p>Lastly the .egg-info directory is for some other Egg/setuptools/easy_install
metadata, but I'm not yet sure quite what that will be (most of the standard
metadata goes in setup.py).</p>

<p>One thing I clearly forgot is tests.  Do tests go in the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">projectname/</span></tt> directory?  I used to put them there, but now I think not.  I think there should be another <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">ProjectName/tests/</span></tt> directory, with a <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">test_config.conf</span></tt> file, a <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">conftest.py</span></tt> file (for <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">py.test</span></tt> configuration), and perhaps new servlets/resources should automatically create a stub <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">tests/test_newservlet.py</span></tt> file, which might start with a (disabled) extremely simple existance test.</p>

<p>I tend to think of resources in the RESTful sense, so if anything, I would put my objects into a &quot;resources&quot; folder, and my templates into a &quot;representations&quot; folder.  Static files (images, scripts, styles) would reside in sub-folders of the &quot;static&quot; folder.</p>
<p>My two cents,</p>

<p>Good point.  Like I said, I didn't really like <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">resources</span></tt>, but then I don't like <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">static</span></tt> either (though that's actually what I've been using up to now).  It defines it purely by its source... which is kind of okay -- I'm not obsessive about this kind of naming -- but I feel like there should be some better name.  <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">media</span></tt> might be a good name -- it seems a bit odd for CSS and Javascript, but even there it's not entirely bad.  Or perhaps separate out Javascript particularly (along with other programmer-centric files like an XSLT stylesheet).  This helps separate files out by roles; at least for those people who work in a collaborative atmosphere, there's a significant practical difference between Javascript and CSS/images, in that it's a very different group of people working with them.</p>

<p>Agreed, &quot;static&quot; isn't too hot either.  I think I'll just bite the bullet and go with &quot;mimetypes&quot;, and categorize the static content in that way.  I could see this approach becoming painful if you had a lot of different types, but for my usual scenario, there would just be text/javascript, text/css, and image/png; not too terrible, I think.</p>

<p>But then you are just duplicating the file extensions in the directory layout.  DRY, and all that.  Some people are anti-file-extension, but I'm actually not in URLs (and definitely not on disk) at least insofar as the extension indicates the content type of the response, not the content type on disk.</p>
<p>There's so many ways to cut it, maybe &quot;static&quot; is the best because it's just the least complex.</p>

<p>Like everything else in software engineering, this depends on your needs.</p>
<p>Have one js file that everything needs?  One simple .css file that everything uses?</p>
<p>Sure, stick them in static.</p>
<p>Have a bazillion php files, each depending on a complex system of rules to generate the various CSS files it's using?  Things get more complicated.</p>
