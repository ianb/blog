        <h1>Python, metaprogramming, and macros</h1>
        <p>
            I was looking at Phillip's
            <abbr title="Common Lisp Object System">CLOS</abbr>-style
            <a
                href="http://dirtsimple.org/2004/11/generic-functions-have-landed.html"
                >generic functions</a
            >
            recently, and it got me thinking about metaprogramming in Python. If
            you haven't looked at those generic functions, it's a very neat idea
            and implementation, and can be expressed quite elegantly in Python
            (at least after adding 2.4's <code>@</code> decorator syntax). (<a
                href="http://patricklogan.blogspot.com/2004/11/more-problems-with-rigid-languages.html"
                >This post</a
            >
            is another recent item that got me thinking about metaprogramming.)
        </p>

        <p>
            Python doesn't have much of anything like macros (which CLOS generic
            methods are implemented with, I believe), but it doesn't seem like a
            big impediment. And there's a lot of metaprogramming that is done in
            Python, without a macro in sight. By metaprogramming I mean
            programming structures that operate on other programming structures.
            Every decorator is a case of metaprogramming; the decorator is a
            function that takes a function as an argument, and returns a
            function (or function-like) object.
        </p>

        <p>
            There's a lot of ways you can do metaprogramming in Python.
            Decorators are one way, and
            <a href="http://blog.colorstudy.com/ianb/weblog/2004/11/18.html"
                >metaclasses</a
            >
            are another. But it can be easier than that; you can modify classes
            on the fly, you can you can do all sorts of things with higher-order
            functions (i.e., functions that take functions as arguments), and
            even do funny sorts of things with import hooks, the
            <a href="http://python.org/doc/current/lib/module-new.html">new</a>
            module, etc.
        </p>

        <p>
            What makes this possible is the fact Python is a scripting language.
            I know some people hate that term; but I think it means something
            very specific, not merely derogatory. A Python module is a
            <i>script</i>; when Python loads a module, it reads the file,
            evaluates the first line, the second line, etc., until it's done.
            Functions aren't declared; rather <code>def</code> creates a
            function on the spot; you can redefine the function later, or define
            it inside another scope, or delete it, or whatever. This causes
            problems (like the problem of changing code in long-running
            processes, or circular references); but it also has some advantages.
        </p>

        <p>
            When we use a module, we can forget that we aren't using the source
            we see in its <tt>.py</tt> file. We're using the objects that are
            created <i>by</i> that source. When loading a module, we're running
            a bunch of statements; some statements are rather benign with few
            side effects (mostly <code>def</code>); others are somewhere in
            between (like <code>class</code>); and others are executed
            immediately, and we only have access to their effects. Decorators
            and metaclasses are two instances; but you can put any statements in
            a module, and any of them can modify what's in the module. You can
            even modify modules after they are loaded (a
            <a href="http://www.zopezen.org/Members/zopista/1023162757/view"
                >monkey patch</a
            >).
        </p>

        <p>
            There are some problems. You can't look inside code programmitically
            (or at least it isn't easy), and lazy evaluation is fairly limited.
            The generics package is forced to use strings for its expressions,
            then compile and execute them in a closed environment. SQLObject
            uses
            <a href="http://sqlobject.org/docs/SQLBuilder.html">SQLBuilder</a>
            which uses Python's magic methods, but is limited;
            <a href="http://www.pfdubois.com/numpy/">Numeric</a> uses something
            similar. Still, there's a huge amount you can do, and all without
            any macros, all simply due to the highly imperative nature of Python
            source.
