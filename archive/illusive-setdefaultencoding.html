                So... thinking some more about my
                <a
                    class="reference"
                    href="do-i-hate-unicode-or-do-i-hate-ascii.html"
                    >Unicode woes</a
                >, I think UTF-8 is the Right Default Encoding For Me. I think
                it will solve a large number of my problems.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you set the default encoding to UTF-8, things like
                <tt class="docutils literal"
                    ><span class="pre">str(u'\u0100')</span></tt
                >
                actually works (and gives you the encoded version). If you
                concatenate the result (<tt class="docutils literal"
                    ><span class="pre">'\xc4\x80'</span></tt
                >) to a Unicode string, the string is automatically decoded and
                it works perfectly. This is what I want! UTF-8, being a superset
                of ASCII, happens to be the encoding I'm already using in my
                sourcecode. I'm <em>perfectly happy</em> moving as many of my
                external data sources to UTF-8 as possible. I'll set
                <tt class="docutils literal"
                    ><span class="pre">DefaultEncoding</span></tt
                >
                in Apache, I'll fiddle with my database, whatever. In those
                cases where I can't, I'll just have to carefully decode the
                data, but I have to do that anyway. To the degree I can make my
                systems and communications consistently UTF-8, things will just
                get better. I really don't see a downside.
            </p>
            <p>
                But why does Python make it SO DAMN HARD to change my encoding?
                I don't understand this at all. There is a function
                <tt class="docutils literal"
                    ><span class="pre">sys.setdefaultencoding</span></tt
                >, but
                <tt class="docutils literal"
                    ><span class="pre">site.py</span></tt
                >
                (which is loaded on Python startup) deletes the function. I feel
                like someone decided they were smarter than me, but I'm not sure
                I believe them.
            </p>
            <p>
                From what I can tell, there's three ways to fix the default
                encoding:
            </p>
            <ul class="simple">
                <li>
                    Edit
                    <tt class="docutils literal"
                        ><span class="pre">site.py</span></tt
                    >
                    (in the standard library) directly. Seems like a bad idea.
                    Though maybe I'll just delete the
                    <tt class="docutils literal"
                        ><span class="pre">del</span>
                        <span class="pre">sys.setdefaultencoding</span></tt
                    >
                    line... anyway,
                    <tt class="docutils literal"
                        ><span class="pre">site.py</span></tt
                    >
                    might appear in other places on your computer as well (e.g.,
                    <tt class="docutils literal"
                        ><span class="pre">/etc/pythonX.Y/site.py</span></tt
                    >).
                </li>
                <li>
                    Create
                    <tt class="docutils literal"

                        ><span class="pre">lib/pythonX.Y</span></tt
                    >). This will apply to all processes. But I'm not sure I
                    feel safe with effecting all Python processes. You could
                    also save
                    <tt class="docutils literal"
                        ><span class="pre">sys.defaultencoding</span></tt

                    here (under a different name) for later access.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Put

            <p>
                And searching about I didn't see one justification for why doing
                any of this is bad, just references to it being a hack, which is
                not very convincing. Are people claiming that there should be
                <em>no</em> default encoding? As long as we have non-Unicode
                strings, I find the argument less than convincing, and I think
                it reflects the perspective of people who take Unicode very
                seriously, as compared to programmers who aren't quite so
                concerned but just want their applications to not be broken; and
                the current status quo is very deeply broken.

                    In python 2.1, setdefaultencoding doesn't work any later
                    than that - because some aspect of encoding is already
                    nailed into sys.stdin/sys.stdout etc. Later versions of
                    python incrementally improved this....

                    &quot;Are people claiming that there should be no default

                </p>
                <p>
                    No. We're claiming that there should be <em>one</em> fixed
                    default encoding that's used when mixing 8-bit and Unicode
                    strings. And that's how things are, really.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When the Unicode type was added, people disagreed on what
                    the encoding should be (ASCII, ISO-8859-1, or UTF-8), so the
                    <em>setdefaultencoding</em> hook was added so we could play
                    with it. Unfortunately, nobody got around to remove it
                    before the release.
                </p>
                <p>
                    (to me, arguing that it's a good thing that you can use a
                    global setting to control what a+b does when a is an 8-bit
                    string and b is a unicode string is about as silly as
                    arguing that it would be a good thing to have a global
                    setting for controlling what a+b does if a is an integer and
                    b is a string. if you want to convert between different
                    <em>logical</em> types (encoded data and text are different
                    things), use an explicit conversion.)

                    wonder what would be the danger in allowing that? Right now,
                    the only way to do that are the three methods mentioned
                    above. None of these sound satisfactory to me.

                    Thank you for posting this. Very helpful. I wound up
                    modifying site.py in python2.4 by changing encoding from
                    &quot;ascii&quot; to &quot;utf-8&quot; in the setencoding()
                    function. Voila! utf-8 from python command line.
                </p>

                    Python 2.4.4 (#1, Oct 18 2006, 10:34:39) [GCC 4.0.1 (Apple
                    Computer, Inc. build 5341)] on darwin Type &quot;help&quot;,
                    &quot;copyright&quot;, &quot;credits&quot; or
                    &quot;license&quot; for more information. &gt;&gt;&gt;
                    import sys &gt;&gt;&gt; sys.getdefaultencoding() 'utf-8'
                    &gt;&gt;&gt;
                </p>
                <p>
                    Then I needed to change the Pydev editor encodings to UTF-8
                    (Window-&gt;Preferences-&gt;General-&gt;Workspace-&gt;Text
                    file encoding in Eclipse 3.2.1). Then I needed to change the
                    run settings in Pydev (Window-&gt;Run-&gt;Common
                    (tab)-&gt;Console Encoding) to UTF-8. Works perfectly now.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Thanks again. Not sure why that was so difficult though...
