        <h1>The Two Sides</h1>
        <p>
            I read a couple articles that mention the 2000 elections as a
            unfortunate polarizing force, from
            <a
                href="http://patricklogan.blogspot.com/2004/10/harry-shearer-on-campaign.html"
                >both</a

                >sides</a
            >.
        </p>

        <p>
            I find this peculiar. Of the people I know who hate Bush, they don't
            hate him because of the 2000 election. It doesn't hurt... but if he
            hadn't stolen the election, we'd all still hate him just as deeply.
            I might even put the whole thing in a more positive light. I don't
            have to feel quite so disappointed in our democracy, because the
            citizens of the US made the right choice.
        </p>

        <p>
            What does it mean to Bush supports that he is so deeply hated by so
            many? I realize Clinton was similarly hated by an entirely different
            segment of the country. If Kerry wins, I suspect he'll be hated as
            well, though to really make it work they'll have to look a bit more
            for a good hook like they had for Clinton. But ultimately the
            loathing isn't entirely rational. I think Dick Chaney is probably a
            worse person than Bush, but his voice doesn't inspire nausea. So a
            hook probably isn't necessary.
        </p>

        <p>
            I wonder when we'll have a president that isn't widely hated? Recent
            elections have been divisive, but Bush had a chance midterm to win
            over a lot of Americans after 9/11, and even a chance to win over a
            lot of foreigners. He pretty much threw that away. Do we only have a
            chance to come together when things get fucked up?
        </p>

        <p>
            As a sidenote, I feel a little awkward about this post. It might
            seem that I want everyone to meet in the middle. Or that both sides
            are on some level equal. Or that reasonable people can disagree on
            these things. I don't think any of those things. There is no
            "middle", except when you look at the issues in a very limited,
            framed manner, and I absolutely don't accept the frames with which
            either Republicans or Democrats view the world. But I'm
            disappointed, because even though this election is between two
            distinctly different people with different policies, the national
            debate around the election has been pretty tedious and lacking in
            vision, creativity, or thoughtfulness. These two distinct sides seem
            to leave little room for other perspectives, perspectives which
            aren't just bullshit and political expediency.

            It's not a new phenomenon - it only seems so because the media has
            no historical perspective. There was a furious minority that hated
            FDR with a passion. Lincoln inspired visceral hatred. Thomas
            Jefferson did as well. Andrew Jackson was absolutely despised by his
            political opponents, who spared no expense in the media of the day
            to make that fact known.
            <br />

            <br />
            The only difference is that we have the internet and 24x7 media now
            to let us find like-minded individuals anytime we want. The level of
            visceral dislike though - not new at all

            The level of dislike is not new. James Robertson is correct and has
            said it better than I. I think that the way the system is setup now,
            it will be a while before we have a widely liked president. The way
            that both sides have attacked each other during this election is
            appalling really. And the truth is , the country is just divided.
            <br />

            <br />
            Which truthfully if Kerry had run a better campaign, this election
            would be in the bag. If you ask a Bushie he would say, if it were
            not for the media, this would not even be a race.
            <br />

            <br />
            Sadly I actually think that if Bush wins we are heading towards a
            really bad time for the U.S. If he wins and gets abortion outlawed
            as he wants, I think that we are heading towards a civil war. I know
            that it sounds nuts and I need to pull out my tinfoil hat... but I
            do think that is where this country is heading.
            <br />

            <br />
            Hopefully not, even if Bush does win, hopefully he will not do
            something that stupid.

            The phenomenon certainly isn't new, but the 24x7 media onslaught
            certainly is. And that's what seems to be qualitatively different
            this time around.
            <br />

            <br />
            Of course, I can't speak for someone back in Jefferson's time, but
            it seems like back then you could just walk away from it and get
            some peace, but today I can certainly turn my tv off, but everyone
            else on the planet isn't and the thought-form of divisiveness is
            omnipresent and seemingly inescapable.
            <br />

            <br />
            Maybe a second round of the American Civil War would push things far
            enough to get people to wake up and stop hating...

            It sounds like you and I are in the same boat, Ian. I'm a Reagan
            Republican who would vote for Bush (I have only a mild dislike for
            him and for his style), if it didn't also mean voting for his
            cabinet. I think there are only two people in his administration I
            would really trust: Rice and Powell.
            <br />

            <br />
            I still wish Powell had run (and won) in 2000--it certainly would
            have made my choice easier this year. Unfortunately, I'm left with
            holding my nose and voting for Kerry now. I've become disgusted with
            some of the things my party has done over the past four years
            (within and outside the White House), but I'm even more disgusted
            with the idea of switching parties...

            AFAICT, you're doing the right thing, Tim.
            <br />

            <br />
            FWIW, any traditional fiscal conservative who would vote for Bush
            probably needs to read this:

            I don't normally do politics, but Ian's last paragraph touched a
            nerve. Viewed from afar (I've just moved from Europe to Australia)
            the election is not so much between two opposing views but simple
            variations on a theme. Looking at the policy statements of both
            candidates they appear to be saying roughly the same things about
            many issues.
            <br />

            <br />
            As far as I can tell whoever wins the election will not make a great
            difference to things like foreign or economic policy. It especially
            won't alter the jingoistic pronouncements by political leaders and
            the media or the oxymoronic posturing that says that America is
            God's own country but dismisses anyone else who makes that claim for
            their own corner of the globe.

            James Robertson is right of course, and in fact it's been MUCH worse
            at some points in the past.
            <br />

            <br />
            To also address your point about "lacking in vision, creativity, or
            thoughtfulness", that's certainly nothing new either although it
            might be much worse in modern times because TV tends to emphasize
            "events" rather than rational thought. My hope is the Internet will
            allow more rational discourse and creativity as it gains wider use
            and acceptance. I guess it'll either be that or a non-stop X Files
            type conspiracy mill :/
            <br />

            <br />
            This won't help settle down the firebrands (because they serve a
            useful function for the party as motivation to the base), but at
            least we finally have an arena for real discourse that we haven't
            had with TV and modern newpapers.
