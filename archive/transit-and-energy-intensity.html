</div><h1>Transit and energy intensity</h1>
 
<div class="document">
<p>After an <a class="reference" href="http://www.theoildrum.com/story/2006/11/13/162141/31">article on The Oil Drum</a> I started
looking up the energy intensity of different modes of transit.
&quot;Energy intensity&quot; is the amount of energy required to do useful work
(for instance, to move a passenger).</p>
<p>Here's what I found (from <a class="reference" href="http://cta.ornl.gov/data/download25.shtml">here</a>; chapter 2, Tables 2.11
and 2.12):</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
                Btu/passenger-mile
Auto (highway)  3549   1.00 (relative to car; smaller is better)
Bus transit     4160   1.17
Bus intercity    932   0.26
Air             3587   1.01
Amtrak          2935   0.83
Rail transit    3228   0.91
Commuter rail   2751   0.78
</pre>
<p>Public transit also doesn't come off very well from this comparison.
Admittedly highway automobile traffic is more efficient than city
automobile traffic.  But still the energy intensity of public transit
is surprisingly bad.  This is contrary to most people's intuition; I
think this is why people expect public transit to be energy efficient:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>People believe that bigger things are naturally more efficient.
That a bigger power plant is better than a smaller one, or a bigger
factory is better than a smaller one, etc.  This is what we've come
to expect from industrialization.  So putting more people in a
larger vehicle must be more efficient.</li>
<li>Environmentalists tend to support public transit (even if for other
reasons than direct energy use).</li>
<li>Many kinds of public transit don't outwardly pollute (even though
their actual impact on the environment may still be substantial,
especially CO2 output).</li>
</ul>
<p>One argument for rail or other mass transit is that it uses electrical
power.  Of course this is not a great environmental benefit <em>now</em> (at
the moment it probably compounds the inefficiencies), but in the
future it allows for the substitution of more environmentally friendly
power generation.  It's also strategically advantageous even if we
continue to use fossil fuels, because unlike gasoline or diesel there
are copious domestic fuels that can be used for generating electricity
(like coal).</p>
<p>Then we should also ask: why is public transit so energy inefficient?
Yes, it's better than cars, but only <em>barely</em> better.  The answer of
course is ridership -- if all the trains and buses were full all the
time they'd be quite efficient.  But they aren't full.</p>
<p>A naive response is that if we just need to encourage more public
transit riders: by growing the systems, providing greater operating
subsidies, and by taxing or tolling auto traffic.  Once ridership is
higher the efficiency will go up.</p>
<p>Does that really make sense?  Consider some situations:</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>Commuter traffic:</dt>
<dd>At rush hour large numbers of people travel, often in particular
directions.  Vehicles have to bring people from their homes to
work centers, then return the mostly-empty vehicles to make
another trip.</dd>
<dt>Non-circular lines:</dt>
<dd>When you have a line that goes from one point to another point,
typically somewhere in the center your line reaches its maximum
utility and maximum ridership -- you've already passed many
population sources, and are yet to reach many desired
destinations.  You need to have sufficient capacity to hold all
those riders.  At the start of the line you've passed only one
population source (the terminal point); at the end of the line you
have only one destination (the other terminal point).  You will
necessarily have less ridership (and empty seats) when you are
close to one of the ends.</dd>
<dt>Off-peak service:</dt>
<dd>Let's say you want to provide comprehensive service (more about
why you might want to do this later).  Then you have to provide
late-night service, and some service to low-density areas.  These
always have low ridership unless you are in an extremely dense
area.  Why is ridership always low?  Well, if you've achieved good
ridership from 6pm-8pm the transit system has to take on the
burden of providing reasonable service from 8-10pm (after all,
someone riding at 8pm very likely needs a return trip at 10pm).
And if you get good 8-10pm ridership, you need to provide
reasonable service from 10pm-midnight, and so on.  &quot;Reasonable&quot; is
a balance between geographic coverage and frequency, and the more
&quot;reasonable&quot; the higher your potential ridership.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Why does off-peak service matter?  Consider cost: public transit can
be quite expensive -- $1.25-$2.00 a trip.  Public transit proponents
counter that cars are also expensive, but the costs are hidden.  This
is true, but the <em>incremental</em> cost of a car trip is fairly low.
You've already bought the car, have the insurance, and the price of
gas is not so high (even now).  It's very hard for public transit to
compete with the incremental cost of a car trip, except when tolls are
<em>very</em> high (as in London) or parking is expensive.  Even with parking
it can be hard for public transit to compete when there are multiple
passengers.</p>
<p>Public transit can only compete with the total cost of a car when it
is a real option to actually ditch the car and rely solely on public
transit (and perhaps other complementary services like taxis and <a class="reference" href="http://www.zipcar.com/">car
shares</a>).  If public transit doesn't provide
reasonably comprehensive service it can't compete as a primary form of
transportation.  The complementary services help here, but they can be
costly and might not be sufficiently flexible; relying too heavily on
those will also cut into public transit's price advantage.</p>
<p>So what's my point?  Mostly I feel that these problems need to be
considered more honestly by public transportation advocates.  But also
we are at a point in history where transportation may change
substantially; concerns about both <a class="reference" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peak_oil">peak oil</a> and global warming mean we
have to reconsider our current transportation infrastructure.  Even
without these concerns traffic itself is starting to become a major
issue throughout the country, and there are no good near-term
solutions; we're seeing substantially diminished returns when building
new/larger roads.</p>
<p>What direction will we take going forward?  Some are calling for an
&quot;Apollo Program&quot; for alternative fuels; a huge, rapid, forceful
program to fix our energy problems.  Usually what this means is an
attempt to switch cars from gas to something else -- usually biofuels,
hydrogen or electricity.  Traffic may be resolved through automated
car lanes.  Both kinds of technology are some ways off, but neither
seems impossible.</p>
<p>Public transit proponents (and despite my negative tone here, I am
one) usually have additional reasons they want public transit.
There's a lot of good reasons (though not everyone will agree with all
of them):</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Negative feelings towards suburban development and culture,
especially the alienating aspect of a car culture.</li>
<li>Denser populations support other forms of transportation like
biking and walking.  Biking and walking are much less alienating.</li>
<li>Cars directly conflict with pedestrians and bike traffic.  (Automated
cars would probably make this even worse.)</li>
<li>Denser populations have other energy and environmental benefits (for
example, New York City residents have the lowest per-capita energy
use in the country).</li>
<li>Public transit is usable by people who cannot drive: children, the
elderly, and the handicapped.  (Automated cars won't help here
anytime in the foreseeable future.)</li>
<li>Public transit has low up-front costs, making it more accessible to
the poor.</li>
<li>More time to read, less time listening to stupid morning radio ;)</li>
</ul>
<p>And more reasons I can't think of now, I'm sure.  I <em>want</em> public
transit to win over private transit.  I just don't think the public
transit we have is a very good contender.  Maybe we can jam public
transit initiatives through the government process once, or twice, or
a few times -- but people have already noticed that these initiatives
are incredibly expensive and underperform.  Retorts that we just
haven't tried it on a big enough scale aren't very convincing.
Solutions like having the U.S. become Europe or Japan just aren't
realistic; the U.S. just <em>isn't</em> any of those places, and just because
something works there doesn't mean we can make it work here.</p>
<p>Mass transit today looks a lot like mass transit 75 or 100 years ago.
People who believe in the promise of public transit need to demand
something more.  We need to stop apologizing for poor performing
systems.  We need to stop pretending it's reasonable to pay $2 to go
five blocks, or that a 15mph system is fast enough, or that having to
stand during your trip is a great way to meet new people.</p>
<p>What should we do in particular?  In my opinion <a class="reference" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_rapid_transit">PRT</a> holds more
promise than any other system I've seen.  Some people disagree, and
they should offer up their own plans.  But please don't try to just
offer the same broken ideas as though they'll work <em>this</em> time.
Existing systems (even ones that <a class="reference" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light_rail">say they are new</a>) simply aren't good
enough.</p>

<p>All those non-car options are looking a little better now. I can see why the report would omit them, give it's angle. Yes, PRT systems look good, but will take a long time to replace the significant existing rail infrastructures we already have. We should still be encouraging people to take public transport over driving their own car.</p>

<p>Thanks for looking up the city energy intensity.  Of course, it also assumes that cars have the same number of average passengers -- but honestly I have no idea if it would go up or down for city driving.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>I don't really think the report has an angle.  I do think they have specific data sources, and very possibly none of them covered city driving.  I imagine it's much easier to figure out how many cars drive on highways than on city roads, and the other necessary numbers that go with that.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>Do they have lots of existing rail infrastructure in Australia?  We don't have hardly any for passenger use here.  We have freight rail lines, which is what Amtrak also uses outside of the East coast, and that sucks.  Much of the rail we have isn't of very high quality, and so it's not particularly fast or reliable to run on.</p>
<p>But PRT doesn't really have to replace existing infrastructure.  There's a tremendous amount of in-fill that has to happen, regardless of the system, so there's a lot of new infrastructure that has to be built.  Really it's hard to compare the two systems at that point, as no one proposes train systems with coverage anything like PRT systems.  Trains simply don't scale that way -- the interchanges are difficult, and changing trains is too slow to have anything like a dense grid.  It doesn't work great for Buses, but at least their stations are so cheap (i.e., just a sign) that they can provide good coverage that way.  Though both trains and buses have a scaling problem where the speed of the system is slowed down by the number of stops -- so the better your station/stop coverage, the worse your travel time.  PRT scales in a completely different way.</p>
<p>Also note that PRT infrastructure is <em>far</em> cheaper than traditional rail because the loads are so much less.  Also because there is redundancy in the system it can be deployed incrementally, and repaired or upgraded without total system shutdowns.  Rail does not do so well in that case and so repairs become extremely complicated and expensive operations.</p>

<p>One thing that would affect these figures is that US rail is far more energy intensive than the rest of the world. The US idea of a commuter train is often some huge heavy thing with its own specific locomotive, compared to the &quot;bus-on-rails&quot; idea in Europe for example, with an underbody engine. I think the USA could use a fraction of the energy running public transit, if they wanted. Even US buses are much heavier and bigger-engine than European for example. So this would affect these figures..........</p>

<p>&quot;Transit rail&quot; has an underbody engine, and does worse than commuter rail (though probably for other reasons).  I think US transit rail uses essentially the same vehicles as in Europe, but I don't really know.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>For some reason we are very reluctant to run small buses.  I'm not sure why; I suspect just to make the fleet more homogeneous, and because like every other kind of transit the people making these decisions don't care about the energy use.  People in the US are probably also more tolerant of the size of buses on the street, so there's no pressure to reduce the amount of space they take up.</p>

<p>A big reason US trains are not is efficient is because the US is nuts about safety.  Thus US trains are often twice as heavy as European trains in order to make them crash worthy.  There are probably many more road-level railway crossings in the US than in Europe.  Still, the US is way more strict, and I don't know how effective that really is at preventing accidents.  Surely it must lengthen the stopping distance, which would be safer if it could be shorter.</p>

<p>The best way to make our existing transit system work is to increase the density.  If you can average to people per car, the efficiency goes up, congestion goes down which also helps efficiency go up.  I like the PRT idea but it requires a HUGE investment in infrastructure.</p>
<p>We have plenty of capacity it's just not utilized well.  In the morning, there's a wide river of traffic going by my house.  I know that many of those people are going close to the same place that I want to go. If there was just some way to link us up, we could share the ride.</p>
<p>I'd like to see a dynamic carpool system. Use the GPS built into the cell phones along with the wireless network to allow people to log in their morning and evening routes.  Other people needing a ride would log in their request.  I computer would link up riders to available drivers and send directions to the driver to pick them up. I don't carpool now because my schedule is to random.  I don't know exactly when I can leave in the evening. With a dynamic carpool, I wouldn't need to.  When I'm ready, I just go down to the street and request a ride then wait for the pickup.</p>
<p>This system works best when there's a lot of traffic.  Lots of cars increase your chance of finding someone going near to your location. It scales up when you need most capacity and avoids that round trip problem that you mentioned.</p>
<p>For off hours, you have a couple of thousand taxi like shuttles on non-determined routes picking up and dropping off people when they request a ride.</p>
<p>Look at the advantages; low or no infrastructure costs, door to door service, 24 hour service cheaper than the other methods.  All you need is the software to track drivers and riders over the cell network and send the instructions to link them up.  Granted, that software might be difficult to write but I don't think  it's impossible.G</p>
<p>Getting people to participate would be the hardest part. You can use the existing carpool programs to encourage ridership.  If the system caught on, you could possibly live in a western city without a car.</p>

I like the PRT idea but it requires a HUGE investment in infrastructure.</blockquote>
<p>While your car pooling idea requires less (additional) infrastructure, all rail-based transit has much higher infrastructure cost than PRT, and PRT should be cheaper than highway lanes of similar capacity.  Of course PRT can't replace the flexibility of roads (which carry things like moving trucks, construction equipment, bikes, ambulances, etc), so it's not really right to compare it to basic road infrastructure (which is inevitably required); but it compares quite favorably to the cost of increasing road capacities.  And as an immature technology there's more avenues open to improve it.</p>
<p>While responsive car pooling or taxi service doesn't require new infrastructure (instead increasing the capacity of current infrastructure) the energy intensity improvements seem limited.  It would feature smaller vehicles, and by being more responsive and adaptive it could carry a higher number of average passengers.  But it still requires vehicles larger than a typical car, and I imagine cars would frequently be running at less than full capacity.  I wonder what the energy intensity of a normal taxi is?  Probably atrocious -- they frequently drive around with no passengers at all, and tend to use fuel-inefficient vehicles.  Ride share systems would certainly be a big improvement over that, and probably buses, but not a huge win.  Though by using less vehicles more intensely you can afford to invest more heavily in fuel-saving vehicles or in vehicle upgrades.  Anyway, an interesting idea.</p>

<p>There's certainly a lot of good things about the suburbs.  Lots of the tolerance and diversity of the city are just built on the apathy and indifference of the populace towards each other.</p>
<p>Personally I don't think centralized cities are a good idea -- cities where there's a strong downtown that is the center of activity, and a blending to residential building from that.  I'd prefer medium density with lots of room for diverse and eclectic land usage -- on all scales, down to mixed use blocks and buildings.  This isn't anti-suburb really, though it is something that traditionally suburbs have outlawed through strict and highly separated zoning.</p>
<p>One of the things I like about PRT is that it's a transit system with no center.  People can choose what their center is, and it will likely overlap with other views of the community -- since really there's always a set of overlapping communities, not segmented communities.  This can respond much better to self-directed changes in communities over time, and without any overarching plans.</p>

<p>Absolutely correct.</p>

<p>That really depends on how you define success.  We have one in our town, but only a very tiny fraction of the population are in a position to utilize it.  It appears empty most of the time.  So if you define success as an alternative to the automobile, I would say it fails.  The numbers just aren't there.</p>
<p>As for the dumpmarkolson blog, I don't know who Mark Olson is.  I've know of J. Edward Anderson, but only vaguely.  I have no connection to either one so I'm at a loss to understand you point.</p>

 I had the PRT fantasy even before I knew what it was called.  It's main problem is the chicken-and-egg 'needs to have world domination before it's successful' issue.  It can't build up the way something like EZ-pass did, which needed MUCH less infrastructure.

My favorite theory on how mass-transit will evolve is basically that self-navigating/crash-avoiding technologies will evolve and mature at the same time as Japan-like minicar options will become more available near American cities (e.g. Vespas with 4 wheels).  Self-navigation will eventually become good enough to navigate huge traffic flows (From a tech perspective, if 802.11s can do it at gigabyte speeds, it can definitely be done at >1millisecond speeds for cars) and most cars by then will be powered by electricity.

Then hopefully, all it will take is a couple cities to pay for specialized car/rail connections for continuous power.  Then the connections may become available to the population (maybe!).
