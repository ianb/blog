<div class="document">
<p>I was just reading through a bit of <a class="reference" href="http://www.devx.com/DevX/Article/26776">OOP Is Much Better in Theory Than in
Practice</a> (<a class="reference" href="http://lambda-the-ultimate.org/node/view/489">via</a>).</p>
<p>A lot of these kinds of critiques trigger my <em>grumpy curmudgeon</em> bit,
so I often dismiss them (maybe this is a sign of ageism on my part).
Often I think they blame a concept for the effects of a process, or
take one concept and use it as a symbol for everything they dislike,
regardless of the applicability.  Here, he critiques OO, but to me it
seems like he's really complaining about <a class="reference" href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?BondageAndDisciplineLanguage">B&amp;D programming</a>.</p>
<p>It's weird, because I'd never think about condemning OOP.  It would be
like condemning the <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">for</span></tt> statement.  I've read some bad code that
uses <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">for</span></tt>, but I certainly wouldn't blame the construct for it.  
It's like blaming carbon for war, or gravity for an icy sidewalk, or
arithmetic for Enron.  Is
this a generational gap, that I have objects ingrained as a basic
metaphor for programming?  No doubt I am very suspicious of many
<em>parts</em> of OOP (like inheritance)... maybe I choose to project those
things I like onto OOP, while dismissing the things I don't like so much (like
encapsulation) as separate.</p>
<p>My first OOP influences were C++ and <a class="reference" href="http://www.oberon.ethz.ch/">Oberon</a> (in school) and <a class="reference" href="http://www.squeak.org/">Squeak</a>
(independent study).  C++ was really used like C, and objects were
fancy namespaces; not very compelling (though it still excited me
after too much <a class="reference" href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?GwBasic">GW-BASIC</a>).  Oberon was surprisingly easy to dismiss as
a language -- decent compiler, interesting UI, but a lousy language.
Maybe if I had used Eiffel or some <em>nice</em> B&amp;D language I might have a
different perspective -- I doubt I'd <em>like</em> it, those kind of
languages just don't fit my personality, but I may not choose to
dismiss that perspective on OOP as being Not The True OO Way.</p>
<p>Now I've grown to see OOP as a mechanical process.  Or you can say
I've become just slightly more curmudgeonly.  Python certainly
encourages this mechanical view, as the OO system is quite
transparent, and reduceable to simple operations (<tt class="literal"><span class="pre">getattr</span></tt>, the
<a class="reference" href="http://www.python.org/2.3/mro.html">mro</a>, and a couple other concepts).  I don't think about <em>is-a</em>
vs. <em>as-a</em> very much, I just focus on the mechanical aspects and I
think I get by pretty well.</p>
<p>There's a lot of critiques about ideas that Aren't Good Enough; like
OOP, or static typing, or metaclasses, or macros, or whatever.  I
think it all comes down to: (a) programming is hard, (b) programming
with objects is also hard, and while we're at it, (c) functional
programming is hard, (d) concurrent programming is hard, (e) type-safe
programming is hard, (f) programming with dynamic types is hard, and
(g) extreme programming is hard.  Some other kinds of programming are
also known to be hard.  Some people might say there's <a class="reference" href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?NoSilverBullet">no silver
bullet</a>; but damn, isn't that obvious?  Programming is clearly <a class="reference" href="http://www.jargon.net/jargonfile/a/AI-complete.html">AI
complete</a>.  Oh well, at least I don't have to worry about losing my job to automation
anytime soon.</p>
