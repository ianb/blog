        <p>
            Well, my
            <a
                href="http://blog.colorstudy.com/ianb/weblog/2004/10/29.html#P169"

            got a couple replies by people that supported Bush because of the
            war in Iraq. Not necessarily because they thought it was a good
            idea, but because we're there now. OK, that logic doesn't quite make
            sense to me, but anyway...
        </p>

        <p>
            The standard Kerry line is that we didn't have a plan and we didn't
            have enough troops. One annoying thing about Kerry is he has a
            boring line that doesn't speak to the facts. Not that Kerry is lying
            exactly, but Bush is much worse than Kerry describes. And
            progressives have started getting soft as they (sometimes
            unconsciously) peddle Kerry's watered-down line.
        </p>

        <p>
            A very interesting article was in a recent Harpers:
            <a href="http://harpers.org/BaghdadYearZero.html"
                >Baghdad Year Zero,
                <i>Pillaging Iraq in pursuit of a neocon utopia</i></a
            >. It describes an agenda in Iraq that was centered around a
            corporation-friendly government; an agenda that has nothing to do
            with security or any purported goal we had in Iraq. (Kind of "War
            for Oil", but a bit more subtle.) It explains some of the odd things
            about the war. Like why are there foreign workers driving trucks?
            Iraqi unemployment is extremely high, and they certainly know how to
            drive trucks. They know how to do a lot more than that, actually;
            it's a modern, secular, educated society that just happens to be in
            terrible disrepair. They aren't structurally incapable of repair and
            modernization, and they really don't need Haliburton's help. Anyway,
            the article lays it out better than I will here. (Harpers, by the
            way, is a great magazine.)

            Ian, your last post was bordering on neutral and more about
            [mis]understandings so I didn't mind posting. The Harpers' piece it
            just a hit piece. Naomi Klein is a anti-corporitist and
            anti-globalization writer (pieces in The Guardian, The Nation and
            the book "No Logo"). She starts off by bemoaning a construction
            crane putting up a billboard (capitalist invasion!) and she just
            keeps swinging that hammer. Her basic complaint is that it is too
            easy and attractive for foreigners to do business in Iraq (the
            horror!). She compares the American commander Bremmer to the Chilean
            dictator Pinochet. Calls the Americans Straussians (I'm not sure why
            this charge is so popular, maybe because the oldest Neocons came
            from the left?). And recoils in horror that Iraq might get a
            Walmart. She envisions something more perfect for Iraqis, but it
            isn't clear what (other than fewer capitalists). The repeated
            assumption that Iraq is a giant testbed for economic theories is the
            stuff of conspiracy theories.

            This is a piece for the converted, a mix of style and anecdote. You
            can't argue against it, and you aren't meant to. It is meant to stir
            the passions and cement opinions, not change them. In short, this is
            light propaganda. That is fine for in-circles where everyone can do
            high fives but it isn't much of a discussion piece.
            <br />

            <br />
            I'll avoid posting in in-circle posts from here out so other people
            can have their high-fives in piece *wink*

            I really think, US gov need to stop this quickly. ~20 000 Iraqis
            died, and bunch of them were only kids or women.
            <br />

            <br />
            Right now, quite everybody knows that money have been a good reason
            to start this war. In EU, the first time we heard about the war,
            everybody say: 'the war for oil is open'. And next we discover
            Haliburton's stuffs ..
            <br />
            US people really need to look other TV channel than CBS or Foxnew.
            Lot of newspapers, books, TV show here (in EU) show another reality.
            (I saw last week, a TV show about US army where solder talk about
            rapes or how many children they have kill .. that's horrifie me. ...
            perhaps FoxNews will do a meaculpa for this too ??? ) (I know most
            of don't really like Mickael Moore, but have you seen his film ? Ian
            ?? beside he is a extremist I learn some things..)
            <br />

            <br />

            <br />
            But it isn't the time to wonder why US decide to launch the war or
            if it was for a good reason, it's time to stop this. Perhaps most of
            you aren't agree with me, but I think UN is the key. That can be
            good way to stop this war, but Bush decide to go against the UN. So
            right now, most of UN people don't want to sign with Bush.
            <br />
            Two weeks ago, there was a talk, and most of people at the show say
            that Kerry is the only person who can right now, ask help from the
            UN.
            <br />

            <br />
            So I think that if you want the war to stop, should give Kerry a
            chance..

            War for oil? Really? I wouldn't know that from the prices I'm paying
            at the pump.

            <br />

            <br />
            Um, maybe because we can't tell who is and is not a terrorist? I
            mean, duh. Would you employ someone if there were a bunch of crazies
            running around your country and wouldn't mind getting their hands on
            a huge truck to store explosives in?

            Give me a friggin break. You uber sophisticated Europeans need to
            wake up and smell the coffee. I forgot, we have to ask the UN
            persmission first. I know it's hard to think that America is
            something other than evil, but, really, try being more informed
            before spouting this bs.

            I don't get it. Anecdotes aren't enough. Facts aren't enough. What
            is enough? The criticisms of Bush are coming from every possible
            angle. They are backed by facts. Facts don't seem to matter anymore.
            But I guess I knew that, trying to figure out why is what the last
            post was about.

            Ian you are at you best when you worry about technologies, and the
            reason for this is that you see the benefits of being pragmatic. I
            just wish you also saw pragmatism as the correct approach to
            politics, which is what I believe is happening here.

            <hr noshade />
            Uhm. Calling the actions of the Bush administration "pragmatic"
            stretches the meaning of that word far beyond recognition ...
            <br />

            <br />
            I really don't understand Bush supporters. It's evident that he lied
            to his people - he himself admitted it (the whole "weapons of mass
            destruction in iraq" stuff, where he and his staff had to admit that
            there weren't any, the whole "Bin Laden Iraq connection" where he
            and his staff had to admit there isn't one). This is not a minor
            mishap like displacing your dick in the mouth of some woman you are
            not married to - this is lying to the people who voted for you,
            lying to the people you swore to protect! You _can't_ ignore
            something like that. You can't call that pragmatic.
            <br />

            <br />
            I might be able to accept that 'murkins can't understand why it is
            bad that he is a religious nut, but this total ignorance of the
            president lying in your face really ticks me off.
            <br />

            <br />
            Over here in Germany we just recently had something similar: the
            Kohl-administration lying, stealing and doing harm to the state by
            shuffling around money without obeying the rules. Nothing where
            people were killed (like going to war on wrong premises), just
            money. Still this gave the Kohl-administration a hard time and
            several people were taken to trial (to bad they couldn't sack Kohl,
            he definitely had deserved it). You can't just accept lying
            administrations and call them pragmatic. You have to make them pay
            for their doings. The minimum would be to throw them out of office
            (like happened to most of the staff of the Kohl administration -
            even their own party don't want most of them still in higher ranks
            within the organization).
            <br />

            <br />
            The US situation mostly reminds me of Italy, where people still
            support Berlusconi, even though he is corrupt, manipulative and a
            liar. Oh, and a ridiculous poser. I don't understand Italy, too.
            Hell, I even don't understand Hessen - state of Germany - as they
            are holding unto Koch as their leader, even though that one is a
            total putz and outrageous liar.

            If you believe this report, the number is around 100,000.
            <br />

            <br />
            Whether you believe this report or not, it's probably safe to say
            that more Iraqis have died as a result of the war than Americans so
            far.

            FWIW, I couldn't find any truck driving jobs in Iraq on monster.com.
            There is one transportation management job for around $80 - $95k /
            year.
