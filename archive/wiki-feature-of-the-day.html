            <p>
                I couldn't do a substantive feature on Wednesday due to taxes,
                but I'm getting back on track. I started working on different
                types of pages (e.g., reST page, plain HTML page, binary image
                page, etc), but I realized I was over-engineering it, so I
                decided to put it off a bit longer. I think I want to keep to
                one feature/release per sit-down (where I &quot;release&quot; to
                the
                <a class="reference" href="http://wiki.w4py.org">live wiki</a>)
                -- that way I won't fall into the trap of working on something
                where I don't already feel comfortable with the implementation.
                I'm hoping that the hard problems will seem easier later.
                (Yesterday I did
                <a class="reference" href="http://wiki.w4py.org/orphans"
                    >orphan</a
                >
                and
                <a class="reference" href="http://wiki.w4py.org/wanted"
                    >wanted</a
                >
                page lists, but those were
                <a
                    class="reference"
                    href="http://www.webwareforpython.org/~ianb/w4py.org/Wiki/Context/orphans.py"
                    >easy</a
                >)
            </p>
            <p>
                Thursday I implemented
                <a
                    class="reference"
                    href="http://wiki.w4py.org/relatedterms.html"
                    >related terms</a
                >
                instead. I'm still trying to understand quite what it is I'm
                doing with this. The basic mechanism is that you list the
                related terms as metadata for the page, and then those
                &quot;terms&quot; (which are really just pages) include your
                page as part of their content. (Why include and not just link?
                I'm not sure yet)
            </p>
            <p>
                At first this just seems like
                <a class="reference" href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?BackLink"
                    >backlinks</a
                >, or maybe more like a
                <a
                    class="reference"
                    href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?WikiCategories"
                    >wiki category</a
                >, which all achieve something of the same effect without adding
                any new ideas. (<a class="reference" href="http://moin.sf.net"
                    >MoinMoin</a
                >
                uses macros to make the categories
                <a
                    class="reference"
                    href="http://moinmoin.wikiwikiweb.de/CategoryCategory"
                    >more direct</a
                >, but that's just an incremental feature)
            </p>
            <p>
                So maybe this is a distraction, but I feel like it could also be
                something more, specifically as it relates to aggregation. Or,
                more specifically, I think it could turn this into a blog fairly
                easily.
            </p>
            <p>
                When the targeted terms have more features (in terms of how they
                include their related pages), then it starts to look like
                blogging software, where the term becomes the aggregation of
                several sub-pages (only they aren't sub-pages, because we still
                haven't introduced any real hierarchy).
            </p>
            <p>
                Unfortunately there's lots of potential options for how the
                target term aggregates the pages, and a wiki page doesn't really
                support that kind of structure. It could be done in a somewhat
                procedural manner with markup macros, but I want to avoid those
                (though they probably could be done reasonably using reST's
                directives).
