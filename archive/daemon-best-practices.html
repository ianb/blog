            <p>Dear helpful readers...</p>
            <p>
                What is the best practice for handling daemons and server
                processes? Does anyone know of good documentation on this?
                Especially considering that otherwise &quot;good&quot; software
                often is crappy at handling this part?
            </p>
            <p>
                <tt class="docutils literal"
                    ><span class="pre">paster</span>
                    <span class="pre">serve</span></tt
                >
                is, in effect, a little application server. It has a
                <tt class="docutils literal"
                    ><span class="pre">--daemon</span></tt
                >
                option and other options. I try to make them nice, but things
                trip me up.
            </p>
            <p>
                Like, I enter daemon mode, then typically bind to a port. If
                something else is already being served up, the startup fails. I
                might clobber their PID file. The startup script appears to
                function, because it exits from the master process, not the
                daemon process, and the master process exited just fine. How
                should I deal with this stuff? I'd like to stick to Python, and
                not use other programs (like
                <tt class="docutils literal"
                    ><span class="pre">start-stop-daemon</span></tt
                >
                or whatnot), but I'd also like to know how those programs work
                -- what they call, in what order, with what protections, etc.
                And which one of the many options out there is best to emulate.
                All just for Posix, of course -- it's a whole different
                situation on Windows.

                    Actually I've had a great deal of luck with
                    start-stop-daemon. It keeps track of your PID, writes the
                    pid file, checks it -- everything. Do one thing, do it well
                    -- start-stop-daemon does it well.

                    The search word you're looking for is 'daemonize'. It
                    brought up Graham's link as the first hit, which looks right

                        twistd's approach is pretty correct as far as POSIX-ness
                        and such goes (I believe), but it's a bit of a mess in
                        terms of internal factoring. If you have ideas about how
                        to improve it so it would be more re-usable please feel

                    Before daemonizing I see if the pidfile exists, if it does I
                    open it and try to lock it. If my lock succeeds, there is no
                    other process.. I the close the file and continue. After
                    daemonization I then open the pid file and lock it, flush it
                    and keep it open (might be race in there).. This has worked
                    pretty well for me..
                </p>
                <p>
                    I still have the issue of something failing after
                    daemonization.. I've had good luck creating a pipe before
                    daemonizing.. After the fork my parent has the read end and
                    the daemon has the write end.. The daemon then can write to
                    the pipe which is then displayed to stdout and it sends a
                    keyword when it has started successfully at which point the
                    parent can then exit. Its worked pretty well, but can get a
                    little complex.

                        Do you (or anyone else) have an example of doing the
                        piping? Live-but-should-be-dead processes are always
                        really painful to debug (&quot;why don't my code edits
                        change anything?!?&quot;), especially since sometimes
                        tracebacks show the <em>current</em> code, not the code
                        that's actually being run, further bending your mind
                        (&quot;how can I get a NameError for x, when x isn't
                        used on that line?!?&quot;).

                    <p>
                        I have added some stuff from QP that tests if a process
                        is still alive, so it should make these detached and
                        untracked servers a little less common (e.g., by testing
                        that a process is dead before deleting the pidfile, and
                        testing that it's not alive before overwriting the
                        pidfile). That might be enough.

                    is a sure bet if you're on unix. Even if you don't like it,
                    please provide an option that stops your program from
                    forking and redirects it's logging to standard out - this
                    way one can wrap in daemontools.

                        runit is even nicer; same design, less djb weirdness:

                        I actually tend to run things like twisted servers from
                        under runit, using twistd's keep-in-foreground option
                        and then letting runit do the daemonization...

                    I've been writing a bunch of daemons in Python lately, using
                    most of the techniques described in the comments above. I
                    soon found that all of my daemons needed to do pretty much
                    exactly the same thing at startup. In addition to the fork
                    and detach, I always need to read a configuration file, set
                    up logging, check and write a pidfile, etc. So I refactored
                    all of the common functionality into a single module. You
                    can see it here:

                    I feel like something like this belongs in the Python
                    standard library.

                        Nice sketch, maybe you should add it to sourceforge, or
