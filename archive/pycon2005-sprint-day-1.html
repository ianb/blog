</div><h1>Sprint Day 1</h1>
 
<div class="document">
<p>Well, it was the first real day of sprinting for me.  I showed up on Sunday a bit to drop in on the PyPI sprint, but I only helped a little.  It sounds like <a class="reference" href="http://www.mechanicalcat.net/richard/log/Python/PyCon_Sprints%2C_day_3">they got ZPT integrated</a> today, at least a bit, which is something I started on earlier.  That's good.</p>
<p>Today I worked on WSGIKit with Eric Radman and Tracy Ruggles, with Simon Wilison stopping in just as I was getting ready to leave.  I didn't have a solid plan coming in, but after looking at some code and staring at the screen in the morning some, we decided to build a sample application and try to remove any rough edges we encountered.  Actually that was more Eric and Tracy's idea.  They worked on a to-do list, kind of like <a class="reference" href="http://www.tadalist.com/">tadalist.com</a>, but we're not really focused on the XMLHttpRequest stuff, just the featureset.  This is an example <a class="reference" href="http://toulouse.amber.org/archives/simple_todo_application/index.html">Jeffrey Shell has been doing in Zope 3</a> as well.  Pair programming seemed to be working for them, as they integrated Tracy's model and Eric's frontend, but triple programming doesn't work as well, so I did my own thing.  I worked on configuration (a simple Python-based configuration) and some other bits of infrastructure.  By the end I hope we have a good example app, with a clear and consistent file layout and configuration, that can be deployed multiple times in the same process.</p>
