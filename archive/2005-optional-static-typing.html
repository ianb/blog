        <div class="document">
            Guido brought up static typing in his keynote, revisiting that
            contentious topic. He actually wasn't that positive about it -- he
            was interested but not confident at all. What kind of disappointed
            me is that what he described can be implemented
            <em>right now</em> using decorators, with only a slightly different
            syntax. You couldn't infer typing by parsing the source, but parsing
            Python source is always a horrible way to find out stuff about the
            code. To programmatically understand Python code, you run the code,
            that's just the way it is, and that can work fine if we all just
            come to terms with that -- not only work fine, it is a real asset of
            Python. Python code is code that builds objects. The objects are the
            important thing, the code that builds them is incidental.
