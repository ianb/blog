</div><h1>Microformats, Feeds, and Blogs</h1>
 
<div class="document">
<p>At <a class="reference" href="http://barcampchicago.com/">BarCamp Chicago</a> one of the topics
of discussion was about blog tools, and generalizing blogs, and adding
features to blog software, and stuff like that.  I like thinking about
blogs as a <a class="reference" href="atom-threading-etc.html">minimalistic set of tools</a>, and a number
of the features people mentioned struck me as great opportunities for
<a class="reference" href="http://microformats.org/">microformats</a> and intermediaries.</p>
<p>For instance, Josh McAdams was writing a <a class="reference" href="http://www.yapcchicago.org/">blog for YAPC</a> and wanted to be able to turn posts
and comments into a FAQ.  A blog post attached to a point in time and
potentially buried in the archive wasn't a great way of answering
questions, but it was a great way of notifying people of things
related to the event (including new questions and answers).</p>
<p>So, I imagine putting something like this into a post:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
&lt;dl class=&quot;faq&quot; tags=&quot;billing&quot;&gt;
  &lt;dt class=&quot;question&quot;&gt;Q: ...&lt;/dt&gt;
  &lt;dd class=&quot;answer&quot;&gt;A: ...&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;
</pre>
<p>And a bot reading your feed would automatically pick it up and put it
into a FAQ page (picking up other information from the feed as well,
like date posted, the link to the original post that may have comments
or other information, and using the Atom ID to detect the difference
between additions and edits).</p>
<p>A FAQ is probably an extraction from the feed -- you'd want the
ability to add items without going through the blog (e.g., for initial
setup), and removing and rearranging items, so the feed is not the
canonical source for items.</p>
<p>Another example was a blog for a specific campaign to raise some money
for charity.  You might post progress like:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
We got another &lt;span class=&quot;donation-addition&quot;&gt;$100&lt;/span&gt; in
donations over the weekend.
</pre>
<p>And it would automatically update the donation counter.</p>
<p>Another idea involved filtering of the blog itself, not just watching
the blog.  To filter the blog, the feed would be the complete
canonical source for the blog, and the public page would just be a
view on that feed.  (This is not currently a common architecture for
blog software, but it could be.)  So, imagine another microformat:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
&lt;div class=&quot;product-item&quot; product-id=&quot;458XY&quot; product-cost=&quot;$19.99&quot;&gt;
  Buy one of our new T-Shirts!  Available in M, L, and XL.
  &lt;img align=&quot;right&quot; src=&quot;/images/t-shirt.jpg&quot;&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</pre>
<p>The intermediary adds a button to purchase the item, maybe coordinated
with a payment system (like PayPal) or with some shopping cart system,
and adds a record about the item and its description to some internal
index.  The post not only introduces the item, but probably serves as
a product page.  The intermediary is configured with information about
payment systems, authentication information to the payment backend,
etc.</p>
<p>In all these cases, the microformats aren't really accessible to large
audiences -- they require writing custom HTML.  But that's solvable
problem, and what makes it interesting is that it can be solved purely
in terms of authoring.  No new tables, no fancy restructuring, the
backend doesn't have to be aware of every feature you might be
interested in.</p>
<p>It's too bad this didn't come up until the second day of BarCamp, and
when things had quieted down some; I bet we could have banged out a
couple examples of this in real code during BarCamp itself.</p>

<p>It's been a while since I've looked at Syncato -- and a while since it's been developed -- but it seemed more about microcontent than microformats... though I suppose the microformat (e.g., <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">&lt;span</span> <span class="pre">class=&quot;donation&quot;&gt;</span></tt>) is like a bit of embedded microcontent -- though often the whole point of a microformat is presenting the content in a meaningful <em>context</em>.  Actually the HyperCardish system we worked on at BarCamp (<a class="reference" href="http://push.cx/2006/bar-camp-chicago#respond">see</a>) has a lot more similarity with Syncato.</p>

<p>Your product example is pretty much what Edgeio is doing. And here's the link as plaintext because your markup docs don't make sense. <a class="reference" href="http://www.edgeio.com/">http://www.edgeio.com/</a></p>
