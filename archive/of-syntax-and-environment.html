                    >2003 PyCon Keynote</a
                >, wherein I thought Paul Graham was off his rocker, I can see
                Robert's point. But in doing so I think he argues two kinds of
                simplicity -- both of which are arguable, but are also very
                different.
            </p>
            <p>
                There's syntactic simplicity, and the simplicity of homogeneity.
                I.e., pure syntax vs. a pure runtime.
            </p>
            <p>
                With syntactic simplicity you get languages like Lisp,
                Smalltalk, Logo, and Tcl (in more-or-less increasing order of
                simpicity and regularity). Advantages:
            </p>
            <ul class="simple">
                <li>Not much syntax to learn (and easy syntactic mastery).</li>
                <li>
                    In some cases a highly manipulatable syntax -- leveraged
                    quite a bit in Lisp (i.e. macros) and some in Tcl. People
                    usually don't get that far into Logo (though they could).
                    And maybe a bit strangely no one seems to care to go down
                    that path with Smalltalk.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Non-advantages:</p>
            <ul class="simple">
                <li>
                    Easy to read. Maybe Perl is hard to read, but humans have no
                    trouble reading syntaxes much more complex than the simplest
                    programming languages.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Easy to parse. You have to be kind of lazy to be driven by
                    this.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Disadvantages:</p>
            <ul class="simple">
                <li>
                    Might miss out on some expressivity. Cases where a human and
                    computer might unambiguously and naturally parse a shorter
                    form, or a more &quot;intuitive&quot; form. Also, noting
                    that uniformity sometimes decreases information (e.g., more
                    punctuation can lead to denser information, as each
                    character can convey more information).
                </li>
                <li>
                    The uniformity might get in the way of making analogs
                    between your system and other computer systems, e.g.,
                    <tt class="literal"
                        ><span class="pre">foreignFunction</span>
                        <span class="pre">with:</span>
                        <span class="pre">arg1</span>
                        <span class="pre">with:</span>
                        <span class="pre">arg2</span>
                        <span class="pre">with:</span>
                        <span class="pre">arg3</span></tt
                    >.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Some things feel shoehorned, e.g.
                    <tt class="literal"
                        ><span class="pre">(+</span> <span class="pre">1</span>
                        <span class="pre">1)</span></tt
                    >.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Note that complex syntaxes can have all these disadvantages as
                well, these are all just generalizations.
            </p>
            <p>
                On the other hand, you can have a pure runtime. Examples include
                Java (excluding JNI),
                <a class="reference" href="http://squeak.org">Squeak</a>, and
                many Schemes. To make a contrast, Lisp and Tcl aren't very pure,
                while Java is yet doesn't have a pure syntax.
            </p>
            <p>Advantages:</p>
            <ul class="simple">
                <li>
                    Safety. Some Master (i.e., VM designer) knows exactly what
                    can and can't happen, and <em>can</em> utilitize this
                    information to make commitments in failure conditions and
                    security concerns. It's still hard work to do this, but in a
                    pure system it's at least <em>possible</em>.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Portability. Just like you can commit to security, you can
                    commit to portable features.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Hackability. Things like
                    <tt class="literal"
                        ><span class="pre"
                            >call-with-current-continuation</span
                        ></tt
                    >
                    can be done more safely when you have knowledge of the
                    system.

                    Debuggability. It's often not useful to be able to see all
                    the way down. My lack of microscopic vision
                    <em>enhances</em> my ability to drive a car. It can be
                    useful, but transparency does not <em>require</em> a pure
                    runtime.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Portability. Oh wait, I included that under advantages too
                    ;) But I don't think homogeneity actually creates very
                    portable systems. Portability doesn't just mean insulation,
                    it means adaptation, and homogeneous systems tend to adapt
                    poorly to their environment. You can be left with a

                Robert talks about Perl regular expressions, vs. Python's. In
                terms of syntax Perl's is less regular and more expressive --
                Python has no native regular expression syntax, and instead uses
                normal strings. But in terms of runtime they are nearly
                identical -- Python happily uses a C backend just like Perl, and
                even a backend with the same heritage
                <em
                    >(note: I was corrected, and their isn't any shared
                    heritage, though they are similarly implemented in C)</em
                >. Java would be a counterexample, since I'm guessing Java
                regular expressions are implemented in Java.
            </p>
            <p>
                Python, since I can't help but bring it up specifically in every
                post, is a particularly impure runtime. It's made significant
                compromises in the process. The
                <a class="reference" href="gil-of-doom.html">GIL</a> is largely
                there to make it easier to mix Python and C code. There's been a
                lot of reluctance to add microthreading and continuations to
                Python, and I think there's also a connection, because Python is
                easier to interface with C if they share a stack, and the C
                stack isn't all that amenable to continuations (though it's not
                impossible; but it truly is impossible with the Java stack).
            </p>
            <p>
                As a syntax, Python is middling. It resists (non-traditional)
                punctuation. It tries to leverage its syntax for multiple uses.
                It has uniformity of attribute access. But it's largely
                programmatically opaque, and there's never been any effort to
                keep it down to a core of primitive constructs.

Really?  Given that the Python RE backend was written by
someone who's never used Perl, on a machine without a Perl
installation, maybe you could explain that sentence?

                        I thought Python regular expressions were
                        Perl-compatible in syntax, and somewhere I guess I got
                        the impression they used the PCRE backend, though I

In 1.5.2, the RE module used PCRE.  In 1.6 and later, that was
replaced with a Unicode-aware engine, SRE, which was written from
scratch, using on the 1.5.2 documentation and test suite as the
specification.

(guess who wrote it? ;-)

                    The GIL is not only for C-extensions. Even if you could wave
                    a magic wand and make all C-extensions thread safe, you may
                    decide to keep the GIL, so that Python bytecode operations
                    remain atomic. Use of the GIL was an engineering choice, to
                    promote performance and simplicity, at the expense of
                    responsiveness.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Because the GIL guarantees atomic bytecode operations, you
                    can make those operations nice and fast, with no worries
                    about thread context changes in the middle (another thread
                    messing up your ducks while you have them nicely in a row).
                    Also makes things simpler, because of the checks you can
                    avoid, you can just plow ahead, knowing nothing happens with
                    threading until you release the GIL.
                </p>
                <p>
                    But you lose responsiveness. Sometimes a thread is started
                    for naught, because an earlier thread hasn't released the
                    GIL yet. Would you want something like a GIL at the heart of
                    a real-time system? Probably not.
