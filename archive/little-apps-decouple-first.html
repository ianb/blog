                Absolutely little apps. But why do I need to run them all
                myself. There are plenty of options coming such as
                <a class="reference" href="http://www.sxip.net/">SXIP</a> that
                will allow me to use someone elses application (running
                elsewhere) for login.

                One of the good things about building your site(s) as a
                community of applications instead of a community of components
                in a framework, is that you've created a decoupled system where
                migration to and from these external services is not a painful
                or architecture-changing process.

                    select u.id, count(*) from users u, forums f where u.id =

                    if your login app is separate from your forum app, you're
                    kinda screwed at that point.

                    brain-damaged object store, this isn't a problem since this
                    sort of thing wouldn't occur to you. :)

                        Separating the login doesn't necessarily mean you cease
                        to keep track of users for your web application, it
                        merely means that the login/logout is handled outside.
                        Single-Sign-on systems generally work in such a way. The
                        user signs on, does some sort of authentication, then
                        you get a token for that user which you store as their
                        identifier in your user database. You still store user
                        data necessary for your web application, the other
                        system handles logging them on/off.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If you made your own WSGI login app, I'd do a similar
                        thing. Once they login, setup a unique token in the
                        environment for the web application, then inside the web
                        application it will still have its own user database,
                        etc.
