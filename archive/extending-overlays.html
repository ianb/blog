</div><h1>Extending overlays</h1>
 
<div class="document">
<p>The more I think about the <a class="reference" href="http://disruptive-innovations.com/zoo/20040830/HTMLoverlays.html">overlay code</a>
I mentioned in my <a class="reference" href="opening-up-templates.html">previous post</a> the more I
want it.  But the actual implementation doesn't seem sufficient to
me... it's very vague that when ids simply overlap they get merged,
and there's no way to indicate an id you mean to be merged and one you
want to use for some other purpose.  Also, the overlay itself can't
pull in external resources, which I want.  And lastly, while
expressions might not be necessary, I think some form of cascading is
good.  For instance, if you have an <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">&lt;h1&gt;</span></tt> element that you want to
take either the document title or something by the id <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">html-title</span></tt>
(which can contain markup), there should be a way to express that.</p>
<p>Now that I think about it, there should also be a way to merge the
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">head</span></tt> elements entirely, probably with some knowledge of the
semantics of HTML (like one <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">&lt;title&gt;</span></tt> element).</p>
<p>So, here's an idea:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">&lt;link</span> <span class="pre">rel=&quot;overlay&quot;</span> <span class="pre">type=&quot;text/x-name-of-this-spec&quot;</span> <span class="pre">href=&quot;...&quot;&gt;</span></tt>
enables this.  Plus, perhaps, some Javascript in the head (if you
aren't doing server-side resolution).  That javascript should look
like <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">&lt;script</span> <span class="pre">src=&quot;...&quot;</span> <span class="pre">type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;</span>
<span class="pre">overlay=&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</span></tt>, and any server-side processor will strip
that out.</li>
<li>In the overlay, you can use an attribute <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">slot=&quot;id1</span> <span class="pre">id2</span> <span class="pre">...&quot;</span></tt>.
This will fill the slow with the content of id1, or id2 if id1 is
not present.  If no id is present, the content will be left in-tact.</li>
<li>In the overlay [or other content?] you can have
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">include=&quot;uri#fragment&quot;</span></tt>.  This includes the given URI.  If a
fragment is given, then the content of the element by id is
included, and the rest is thrown away.  [Should the content of the
head be kept/merged?  Should there be other things besides simple id
matching to include bits, like XPath or somesuch?]</li>
<li>The contents of <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">&lt;head&gt;</span></tt> are merged.  <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">&lt;meta&gt;</span></tt> tags that match
(i.e., the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">http-equiv</span></tt> or <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">name</span></tt> attribute match) are removed.
Duplicate titles are removed.  I think that's all I care about.  The
first document (the one that links to the overlay) gets priority,
then the overlay, then included content (if included content's head
stuff is included at all).  Other content, like scripts and styles
and links, are all thrown together in the head from all sources.</li>
</ul>
<p>I think that's it.  Damn, that shouldn't be hard to implement.  But I
must keep myself from implementing it, because I'm really trying to
get the last few loose ends together for a Paste 0.4 release.
Must... stop... self...</p>
<p>The one pain in the ass part of this is <a class="reference" href="xml-processing.html">parsing HTML</a>.  Easy in
Javascript, but not in Python.  With <em>parsed</em> markup, this is
super-easy to implement.</p>

<p>I did not completely what you are trying to do but it sounds like reinventing something like kids content and replace attributes, does it not?</p>
<p>BTW, parsing the HTML can be easy if XHTML would be used at all times or maybe generated with Tidy.</p>
<p>Using Javascript on the client sounds a bit strange as that implies <em>needing</em> javascript and break of the system without it which is not very nice. Maybe ok for special apps but not for webpages.</p>
<p>Otherwise a use case for overlays would be something like an CMS editor overlay which adds the needed buttons like <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">edit</span></tt> or <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">delete</span></tt> to the HTML. Or even just as your Commentary (which looks absolutely great by the way) simpler stuff like adding doubleclicks to certain areas.</p>
<p>What do you really want with these overlays would be my general question I guess (maybe I am just to lame to understand but all this sounds really interesting at least for some stuff I would like to do too)</p>

<p>I don't think it is &quot;reinventing&quot; anything from Kid in particular.  This is purely declarative and is not associated with any templating language.  It's fairly close to ZPT's METAL, except with special consideration for HTML (the merging of head elements), and cascading of slots.  And of course implemented at a much later stage than METAL would be (since that is actually done before templates are rendered).</p>
<p>For server-side parsing I'd probably require XHTML or maybe particularly well-formed HTML.  Client-side this isn't a problem.</p>
<p>As far as needing Javascript, that is a concern.  I'm not sure how big of a concern it is -- I think this has the potential to be more accessible than current server-side rendering anyway -- but I think it is part of why HTML Overlays haven't been used by nearly anyone (that I know of).  A dual implementation is possible, with server-side rendering for those people who need it.  Detecting the non-presence of Javascript is always such a pain, though :(</p>
<p>One of the other major issues I see is how it interacts with other Javascript and onload events.  That and how it responds when some part of the process (the overlay itself or included content) is slow to fetch.  Moving to async would be good (the original code is synchronous I believe), but then you get the cross-domain issues.</p>
<p>As for the goal, it's really for crude skinnability of applications.  As long as you aren't too obsessive, overlays with CSS tweaking should be enough to make several applications seems like a cohesive whole.  Not perfect, mind you, but it should let you get 80% of the way really really quickly.</p>
