                About two years ago I gave

                (The Humane Editor) a try. Since Raskin is
                <a
                    class="reference"
                    href="http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=05/01/26/1338224"
                    >back in the news</a
                >
                and presumably going to continue work on THE, I thought I'd
                repost my thoughts (originally left in the
                <a
                    class="reference"
                    href="http://sourceforge.net/forum/forum.php?thread_id=796533&amp;forum_id=193382"

                >
                -- they didn't have a mailing list back then). I actually want
                to write more about THE and some of the ideas, but I'll start
                here. Mostly I was just comparing it to Emacs (my primary
                editor):
            </p>
            <p>
                While I thought it was interesting, it seemed like a distinctly
                less powerful Emacs.
            </p>
            <p>
                LEAP is actually very similar to incremental searching in Emacs
                (C-S and C-R for reverse searching).
            </p>
            <p>
                The modal nature of Emacs (where you don't have to hold down a
                key while typing your search term) is definitely easier on the
                fingers (typing multiple characters with the shift key down is
                annoying).
            </p>
            <p>
                Emacs also allows case-sensitive searching, which is very
                useful. Perhaps that's more the case in programming, where I
                know if I search for a capital letter I'm going to get to a
                class definitition faster (since in programming case is more
                meaningful than normal text). Note also Emacs is only case
                sensitive if you type at least one upper case letter.
            </p>
            <p>
                Emacs' incremental search also works well for finding things off
                the page. It seems necessary to disambiguate your search with
                LEAP -- but when I'm looking for all instances where a function
                is used, I don't yet <em>know</em> the context of my search. So
                I have to do multiple LEAPs, I can't use LEAP as a skimming or
                proofreading tool. In Emacs you hit C-S (C- meaning Control) and
                it goes to the next instance (like C-G in Netscape).
            </p>
            <p>
                I use incremental searches often in Emacs to navigate, even just
                to navigate on the same line. It's a great idea, but I think THE
                should pay much more attention to Emacs and the maturity of its
                interface.
            </p>
            <p>
                Like THE, Emacs also does not use dialog boxes. It has a status
                bar on the bottom which is used for input and message display.
                It's very close to THE's transparent messages, only not nearly
                as distracting or obscuring.
            </p>
            <p>
                Lastly, Emacs has long-form commands. By typing M-X you get
                access to all the commands in Emacs. Really it's an excessive
                number of commands. And there isn't an obvious mapping between
                command names and key bindings (though you can look up the
                commands for bindings, and Emacs suggests bindings when you type
                in a command). Though Emacs could use some editorial
                consideration in the commands it exports, the commands are as
                powerful as THE aspires to. Emacs embeds a large number of
                applications, which are accessible through these commands. The
                menus are actually sadly inadiquate for most work.
            </p>
            <p>
                Emacs seems to be what THE aspires to be. It's a mail client,
                news reader, web browser, etc. Certainly it has significant
                flaws. I would love to see an editor inspired by Emacs written
                from scratch in Python. The key bindings might change among
                other things, but learning from the lessons of Emacs (and
                avoiding the problems of elisp).
            </p>
            <p>
                Have the developers of THE used Emacs significantly? If not, I
                fear they will just make a pale imitation of a wonderful program
                and environment. The lessons of Emacs could well stand to be
                popularized and improved upon, but 25 years of development and
                improvement by people who use a program so intimately as
                developers use their editors -- that deserves a lot of attention
                from anyone interested in user interface.

                <p>What about VIM!</p>
                <p>
                    I understand you are an emacs fan. I would not dare restart
                    this classic flame war :D
                </p>
                <p>
                    However, for some reason whenever I pictured a Python based
                    editor... I always thought it would end up more like VIM. I
                    am not sure of THE, because I have not used. But it sounds
                    like EMacs is more key-binding oriented where THE is on a
                    different page all together.... so, it does not sound to
                    Pythonic.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Better yet, I would like to see an editor which is half
                    python command line / half editor. Maybe a split screen like
                    the ones from VIM. Somehow you can insert what you tried
                    above into the code below.

                        Emacs is like THE not as an editor, but as an
                        environment and infrastructure for building
                        applications. VIM is just an editor; which maybe people
                        like, but is entirely unlike THE, and quite unlike Emacs
                        as well. In the case of Emacs, it's an environment where
                        editing is at the center of every application -- the
                        basic metaphor for interaction is editing. Which I think
                        has a lot of good points (and maybe some bad points),
                        and THE seems to share this same orientation.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        THE happens to also be very key-oriented. I can't
                        remember now if the mouse actually did anything at all
                        (though maybe it would if it hadn't been at a fairly
                        early stage of development). As far as Python... well,
                        that's neither here nor there; I guess it's important
                        since these editors are built for extensibility and the
                        development language effects that, but I don't think
                        they need to reflect the values, that would be putting
                        the cart before the horse.
