        <h1>Smart vs. Dumb Templates</h1>
        <p>
            Sometimes people think that layout is simple. You need a big, smart
            language like Python to do programming -- but something more limited
            will do for the layout and rendering. In fact, there's usually a
            little arrogance in there -- the templating language
            <i>should</i> be simple, and it <i>should</i> be underpowered,
            because you want to hobble the template writers lest they escape
            into the Dark Forest of Programming, taking maintainability with
            them.
        </p>

        <p>
            At first it seems like this would work. But all programs start out
            simple (at least if you are writing them correctly). I think people
            believe layout can be simple because rendering is sloppy. Good
            rendering doesn't lead to "You have 0 message(s)" (and if you're
            going to be sloppy, at least make it obvious by saying "Messages: 0"
            -- use natural language right, or just don't use it at all).
        </p>

        <p>
            There's lots of other layout issues. Many pages render improperly
            when the content is too short, or has long lines, and so on. And
            these are problems just for rendering relatively static material, as
            opposed to interactive web applications.
        </p>

        <p>
            Okay... so people do sloppy programming, that's fine. Sloppy output
            is a much smaller sin than other kinds of programmer sloppiness. But
            a templating language should be able to stay with you from
            sloppiness to refinement. If your template language is underpowered
            you're putting up a future barrier.
        </p>

        <p>
            And instead, layout starts creeping back into the "control" code.
            You have to provide the template with partially rendered input, or
            precalculate values for consumption only by your templates. You can
            separate hard programming from easy programming, or you can separate
            logic from layout, but you cannot do both.
        </p>

        <p>
            Things become even worse if you are dealing with an interactive web
            application. A web UI is a subtle thing, and prone to overall
            suckiness. (It is ironic that I am a web programmer, yet I rather
            dislike web interfaces) "Layout" and "display" become very
            complicated -- if you are writing your UI well! A simple display
            gives people only small snippets of information at a time, leads to
            low-content interstitial pages, forces information traversal instead
            of nested display, and lacks helpful or predictive direction. A good
            UI involves all sorts of little rules, exceptions, warnings,
            qualified feedback and compound screens. Wimpy template languages
            are not up to the job. Though you might ask: are any template
            langauges up to the job?
        </p>

        <p>
            <a href="http://pyds.muensterland.org/">PyDS</a> (which I use to
            publish this weblog) uses
            <a href="http://cheetahtemplate.org/">Cheetah Templates</a> for much
            of its display. Cheetah is a full-featured templating language
            (perhaps the most full featured of Python templating options, though
            <a href="http://www.alcyone.com/software/empy/">empy</a> might be
            close). PyDS uses quite a few templates to control the process --
            but they are very dense. Some sorts of layout control
            <i>should</i> be easy, like rearranging elements or tweaking the
            granuarity of CSS classes. But reading the PyDS templates isn't
            easy, they are dense with code and difficult to understand. So I'm
            not sure, should template languages be powerful, or should we leave
            them dumb and couple them with Python code?
        </p>

        <p>
            (I might add: PyDS templates, or other complex templates, might be
            simpler to work with if they used Cheetah's inheritance features; a
            Cheetah editor would also be neat ;)

            Actually I tried to use the Cheetah inheritance feature in the start
            of PyDS. I failed miserably - don't know wether it was a bug or my
            stupidity or both, though ;-)
            <br />

            <br />
            There were some weird things about the inheritance that got me to
            change over to the way I now do it. The templates are actually quite
            simple - there are *Template.tmpl files, that describe your desktop.
            There are *Rendering.tmpl files that describe your clould. There are
            Base*.tmpl files that describe your outer layout (where to place
            what). All other templates are for tools and carry the tool name in
            their filename.
            <br />

            <br />
            Templates are in a very simple way: the tools push their contents
            into the tool template. What comes out goes into the base template.
            The rest is just pushing around objects and prefilling the template
            namespace.
            <br />

            <br />
            So for layout changes you mostly work on the Base*.tmpl files, as
            they define your layout. The others are more "push this out of the
            code" templates. But the template situation is still a bit weird
            with PyDS, as not all areas are templated (many tools don't use
            templates but could make use of them: for example the aggregator
            should be changed to templates one day, so you could influence your
            aggregator layout better).

            I'm on the fence when it comes to templating. My first instinct is
            to say that presentation layers should only wory about presentation.
            i.e., where bits should go and how they should look. Everything else
            should be code, because it involves data processing and
            non-presentation logic. Thus, one does not have to work in two (or
            more!) distinct programming languages and deal with the inevitable
            impedence mismatches that result. So by this argument, template
            languages should be a fancy syntax for nothing more than simple
            string concatination and replacement engines.
            <br />

            <br />
            However, the flaw in this seems to be that many people view a
            templating language as a vehicle for non-programmers to act like
            programmers without getting into too much trouble when they make
            mistakes. So this mind set uses wants template languages to be a way
            of adding safe, managed code to projects by potentially unsafe
            developers.
            <br />
            And down that path seems to be maddness.

            <hr noshade />
            But my entire point was that a simple templating language isn't up
            to the task of presentation. If you want the templating language to
            handle presentation, it must be a powerful and complete language,
            because presentation isn't an easy problem. I don't think tools
            should be crippled in order to keep people from doing what they
            shouldn't -- carrots are better than sticks.
            <br />

            <br />
            PHP, for instance, has "powerful" templates, with nothing
            <i>except</i> templates. So stuff gets all mixed up. But the problem
            isn't that the templates in PHP are too powerful. Rather they lack
            the carrot to keep people from putting code in templates. In Zope
            DTML was a mess, but that had a lot to do with the lack of Python
            Scripts. You still get growth issues, but those are refactoring
            issues. When things get messy you refactor them -- that's the
            natural development process, and messiness is an inevitable
            side-effect of development. But those things should be fixed -- the
            dumb template alternative is to avoid messiness and refactoring by
            keeping people from doing anything at all, or by forcing them to
            create sub-standard presentations.

            After many attempts I would say: reduce templates to a minimun. In
            the past I've tried ASP.NET, XSLT and Cheetah (with Webware) to
            separate code and layout, but I always ended up to have a mess in
            the (X)HTML. So recently i started experimenting with XHTML and DOM
            manipulation.
            <br />

            <br />
            Most of the times what I really need is a "Master Page" concept that
            hold common elements shared among site pages and a way to children
            pages to replace blocks in the mater pages with specilized content.
            This is what Cheetah does, but it should really stop there.
            <br />

            <br />
            For example in Python it's very easy to generate a [select] and
            [options] fields plus-item-currently-selected with a list
            comprehension, but in Cheetah it'is not that compact, you have to
            use a #for, an #if/#else but doing this broke the WYSIWYG HTML
            editor. So you have a language that looks quite like Python but
            lacks of the most advanced (and useful) features. I don't like it.
            <br />

            <br />
            Also delegate all the presentation to CSS helps a lot. You can
            changes fonts, background colors and, sometimes, elements position
            via CSS bypassing XHTML altogether.
            <br />

            <br />
            To my knownledge there are a couple similar approaches in Python:

            I've worked with non-Python programmers and templating systems in
            the past. And I see your point about sufficient power in the
            templating system.
            <br />

            <br />
            There are a number of considerations involving templating languages
            that do not have to do with power.
            <br />

            <br />
            One is the nature to do a form of round trip. Can a template be
            given back to a designer (or designer's software) and can this
            designer then make adjustments without getting hopelessly confused
            or breaking the logic of the template all the time? Both ZPT and
            Twisted Woven are attempts in this direction. Lots of program code
            in a template can break this.
            <br />

            <br />
            The other, which is a recent insight I'm still exploring, is how
            much of the program has to be exposed to the template designer at
            all. Most templating systems allow calling into the program's API,
            which can have a complex object model below it. This has two
            problems:
            <br />

            <br />
            * the template designer can be exposed to lots of aspects of the API
            that this designer has nothing to do with. It's not clear whether
            the designer needs most of this information; the designer may get
            confused or the designer may cause parts of the program to be called
            that were not intended to be called from the template directly at
            all.
            <br />

            <br />
            * Bugs in the software are exposed to the template designer. The
            template designer can create perfect template logic, and be exposed
            to errors in the software that have nothing to do with his own
            performance as a template designer. The template
            <br />
            designer is exposed to complex error messages in the application
            logic.
            <br />

            <br />
            I think that a template designer needs enough power but should not
            have to deal with the junk in the underlying system so much. I also
            suspect the template language does not need *that* much power if the
            data that is fed into the template already is prepared for various
            circumstances; i.e. Python logic on a view.
            <br />

            <br />
            I don't mind if the designer writes parts of the view code (outside
            the template), too. It will probably result in better factored
            templates as common expressions can disappear into simple view
            methods.
            <br />

            <br />
            Most view systems are 'pull models'; API calls pull the information
            from
            <br />
            the object model. The problems I mentioned above are hard to avoid
            in those. There are also view systems with aspects of a 'push
            model'; information is pushed outside the application into a bundle
            that can be easily accessed by the view, and which only contains the
            information needed by the views. Bugs in application logic will
            often be exposed in the push phase, not afterwards. Streams of data
            will be combined before they reach the view, so it's not the job of
            the view to query various part of the program directly, only what is
            produced by the first phase.
            <br />

            <br />
            What is pushed out can be strictly defined. XML pipeline
            <br />
            models such as in cocoon have push properties, and are therefore
            interesting in this respect. The stage before the view template
            produces an XML
            <br />
            document with the relevant information to display the view.
            Programmers
            <br />
            can debug what appears in this stage without bothering the view
            <br />
            developer, who only has access to the output of this stage.
            <br />

            A case can be made that most of these so-called "underpowered"
            templates are actually 1) *overpowered*, and 2) based on the wrong
            paradigm.
            <br />

            <br />
            By contrast, check out the templating in PSO (Python Service
            Objects), Twisted's Woven, and my own peak.web.templates. Each is
            based on the idea of designating portions of output as being
            rendered by Python components. But, the components aren't
            responsible for generating actual output markup. That is, the Python
            components don't know anything about markup language, they simply
            manipulate markup provided to them as parameters.
            <br />

            <br />
            From this approach, you can do anything that a typical templating
            language does, but you're forced to do it modularly, in Python. The
            end result is that there's no code in your template, and no template
            in your code. Instead, UI developers simply choose from available
            structural manipulations to apply to the markup. The result is
            VB-like, in that you just add controls and parameterize them (with
            markup). If new controls are needed, you write them in Python,
            producing the best of both worlds.

            i've been using the perl templating module
            <a href="http://html-template.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank"
                >HTML::Template</a
            >, for years and have never felt at all limited by it, even though
            it probably falls closer to the Dumb end of the spectrum.
            <br />

            <br />
            as i've started working more in python, i discovered an
            underappreciated benefit of HTML::Template: language independence.
            the template syntax itself isn't tied to perl or any other language
            and clones exist for
            <a
                href="http://htmltmpl.sourceforge.net/python.html"
                target="_blank"
                >python</a
            >,
            <a href="http://htmltmpl.sourceforge.net/php.html" target="_blank"
                >php</a
            >,
            <a href="http://html-tmpl-java.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank"
                >java</a
            >, and probably other languages. so the designers i work with
            haven't had to learn a new template syntax just because i've changed
            to a new application language, and i've been able to successfully
            port apps from perl to python without touching the template files.

            also, perrin harkins has a pretty good discussion of various
            templating systems (perl oriented but the basic ideas carry over):

            We've discussed this internally many times and I personally have
            come to the conclusion that your system should have an API that your
            delivery layer calls. The delivery layer is the combined code and
            templates needed to render the componenent that goes onto the
            screen. Each of these components then gets called/included/whatever
            to place it onto the screen framework.
            <br />

            <br />
            so we get
            <br />

            <br />
            1) Code to handle data
            <br />
            2) Code to convert data into form ready for displaying (date
            formats, ordering, paging whatever)
            <br />
            3) Markup to render the converted data
            <br />
            4) Page build that combined different componenets together
            <br />

            All of my new projects use a very smooth combination of XSLT and
            CSS, and I like it a lot. Most of the logic is in my PHP code, but
            then some of the display logic can just be handled using XSLT stuff.
            XSLT may not be useful to graphic designers, but it's perfect for
            programmers.

                    &quot;you want to hobble the template writers lest they
                    escape into the Dark Forest of Programming, taking
                    maintainability with them.&quot; - What a nice saying, Ian!
                    ROFL!!!
                </p>
                <p>
                    &quot;You can separate hard programming from easy
                    programming, or you can separate logic from layout, but you
                    cannot do both.&quot; - Aha! Now I understand why the
                    problems of template languages is one of the most painful
                    problem I know. Thank you!
