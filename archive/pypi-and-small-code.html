        <h1>PyPI and small code</h1>
        <p>
            In some of my more recent developments I've been trying to build
            smaller, more reusable modules. A lot of them aren't necessarily
            terribly robust or generalized, but (for me at least) they are an
            improvement. Some of them might be useful to other people. And I'm
            sure there's lots of people who have done the same.
        </p>

        <p>
            These files are part of larger projects, but aren't
            <i>really</i> related. For instance, the
            <a href="http://wiki.webwareforpython.org/thiswiki.html">wiki</a>
            has some modules related to file uploading (<a
                href="http://www.webwareforpython.org/~ianb/w4py.org/Wiki/lib/ftpclient.py"
                >FTP</a
            >
            and
            <a
                href="http://www.webwareforpython.org/~ianb/w4py.org/Wiki/lib/sshclient.py"
                >SSH</a
            >) which are decoupled and pretty much unrelated to the larger
            application. There exist more complete libraries (like
            <a href="http://www.lag.net/~robey/paramiko/">Paramiko</a>), but
            there are many small-scope problems that call for small-scope
            libraries. I would probably have written less of these modules
            myself if I had a good place to find other people's work.
        </p>

        <p>
            Right now the only place we have to keep this code is the
            <a href="http://aspn.activestate.com/ASPN/Python/Cookbook/"
                >Python Cookbook</a
            >, which has a whole host of problems. It would be great if PyPI
            could take over that role.
        </p>

        <p>Some issues:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                These aren't real packages, though they frequently belong to
                larger packages.
            </li>

            <li>
                There's no release schedule, maybe no independent versioning,
                seldom documentation outside of docstrings.
            </li>

            <li>
                Usually no distutils setup and there probably shouldn't be one.
            </li>
            <li>Hosting is likely to be unreliable.</li>
            <li>
                There could be a huge number of these libraries, of widely
                varying scope and quality.
            </li>

            <li>
                There's likely to be naming conflicts. (But since these aren't
                packages, that's not as bad)
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            With this in mind, the structure of PyPI doesn't seem right. But the
            Python Cookbook is too little structure.
            <a
                href="http://aspn.activestate.com/ASPN/Cookbook/Python/Recipe/286134"
                >Safe Expression Evaluation</a
            >
            is not a recipe. It's not a package either. It's a module. Maybe I
            don't want to "release" my code, but I <i>do</i> want to update it
            and provide the most up-to-date version. I do want to document it
            and provide it as a consistent module, not just a recipe. I want to
            provide both the module, and provide information about relationships
            to other modules (e.g., those <tt>ftpupload</tt> and
            <tt>sshupload</tt> modules go together, but can be used
            independently). As a user I want PyPI to keep the code around when
            the informal releases go away. I want to see what other people think
            of the code, and what other modules might be a better (or worse)
            choice, or modules that are symbiotic. I want other people to be
            able to take over or fork the module in a structured way (i.e., make
            the forking relationship clear).
        </p>

        <p>
            When I think about the concrete features, most of them could apply
            to normal packages as well. So maybe this is just a generalization
            of PyPI.

            PyPI is intended to be an index of metadata that is generated by
            distutils. I'm not sure I'm comfortable extending that scope to
            include actual code fragments. It would confuse the meta-data schema
            and user interfaces considerably.
            <br />

            <br />
            Having said that, PyPI now has a reasonable user database which
            could be useful to you. Code like the Trove handling could also be
            useful. I've always wanted some form of comment / rating system for
            packages too - and that'd be essential for a code fragment database.
            <br />

            <br />
            Finally, PyPI is bordering on being too large for the technologies
            it's built on; sqlite will need to be replaced by postgresql some
            time soon and the cgi.py-based web ui scales very poorly.
            Development such as you're proposing would push those technologies
            over the edge :)

            "Finally, PyPI is bordering on being too large for the technologies
            it's built on; sqlite will need to be replaced by postgresql some
            time soon"
            <br />

            <br />
            Eh? Could you elaborate on what you mean? What exactly is too large
            for sqlite?
            <br />

            <br />
            From the sqlite FAQ:
            <br />

            <br />
            "(10) Are there any known size limits to SQLite databases?
            <br />

            <br />
            As of version 2.7.4, SQLite can handle databases up to 2^41 bytes (2
            terabytes) in size on both Windows and Unix. Older version of SQLite
            were limited to databases of 2^31 bytes (2 gigabytes).
            <br />

            <br />
            SQLite arbitrarily limits the amount of data in one row to 1
            megabyte. There is a single #define in the source code that can be
            changed to raise this limit as high as 16 megabytes if desired.
            <br />

            <br />
            There is a theoretical limit of about 2^32 (4 billion) rows in a
            single table, but this limit has never been tested.
            <br />
            There is also a theoretical limit of about 2^32 tables and indices.
            <br />

            <br />
            The name and "CREATE TABLE" statement for a table must fit entirely
            within a 1-megabyte row of the SQLITE_MASTER table. Other than this,
            there are no constraints on the length of the name of a table, or on
            the number of columns, etc. Indices are similarly unconstrained.
            <br />

            <br />
            The names of tables, indices, view, triggers, and columns can be as
            long as desired. However, the names of SQL functions (as created by
            the sqlite_create_function() API) may not exceed 255 characters in
            length."

            The "too large" is not disk space, but more related to the limits of
            it being a cgi app that opens the database each time.
            <br />

            <br />
            sqlite also only allows a single writer per database, and even that
            is less useful than it could be. If you have a writer and one or
            more readers on the same DB, and the writer tries to modify a table
            while a reader is reading from it, the writer will fail.
            <br />

            <br />
            Don't get me wrong - sqlite is great for small single-user
            prototypes, and it's certainly much better as an SQL engine than
            *spit* mysql, but it doesn't scale in the way that PyPI needs.
            <br />

            <br />
            Unfortunately getting a PG instance up and running is subject to
            round tuit availability on the part of the relevant python.org
            folks.

            Surely the code fragments could live somewhere else, and everyone
            could be encouraged to upload their packages/modules to that
            location and to specify it as the download URL in PyPI. Obviously,
            it would be nicer if one could upload the package using the PyPI
            interface, however.
            <br />

            <br />
            And as for the comments and ratings systems, is something like

            Pretty much anyone with spare time and bandwidth allowance could
            step up to that, sure. Not hard. All you need to do is make
            available a small script which imports a module, runs some obvious
            function (<tt>__minidist__</tt>?) to get a dictionary containing a
            subset of the usual setup keywords but without the py_modules, and
            lobs it at the minidist site with an XML-RPC call. The minidist site
            can then register more extensively with PyPI and make the module
            available as an automatically stitched together zip or tarchive with
            an appropriately generated <tt>setup.py</tt>. Overall, not a bad
            weekend hack. If only I weren't moving house. :|

            What about the vaults of Parnassus ?
            <br />
            It's maintained by hand - but it has a good set of links to small
            modules of the sort mentioned by Ian. Only links though, no
            repository.
            <br />

            <br />
            Whats the address of the catalog-sig ? I'd be willing to do some
            work on maintaining... be nice to put something back ?

            The Vaults are almost identical in scope to PyPI, which reduces the
            value of both of them. For catalog-sig:
