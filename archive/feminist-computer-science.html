                about women in technology, which got me to thinking about it
                again.
            </p>
            <p>
                One possibility is that it's discrimination, or that women are
                unwilling to enter a field that is dominated by men even if
                there isn't other discrimination. However, I don't believe that
                offers much of an explanation. While geekiness in general has a
                masculine feel to it, I believe this is descriptive, not
                prescriptive. Simply, the tendencies that make a person well
                suited to computer science are tendencies that are primarily
                found in men. The priorities, interests, skills, and inclination
                of women simply don't point in those same directions.
            </p>
            <p>
                One could say that few women probably have those tendencies
                which would be best for accountancy either, and yet there are
                many women accountants -- I would counter that men aren't
                particularly inclined towards interest in that area either. You
                don't become an accountant because of a deep passion (at least,
                I don't think so... a passion for accountancy seems a little
                sad), you become one because you are sufficiently adept at the
                necessary skills, and because someone will pay you to do it.
            </p>
            <p>
                The same could be true of computer science -- there are women
                who are sufficiently adept with the necessary skills, and
                someone will pay you to do it. When that is the only
                requirements, there tend to be more women. But when there are
                people who <em>do</em> have a passion, those people tend not to
                be women. There are subfields of IT where people do have a real
                passion, and there are much less women in those fields. I think
                programming is one such subfield of IT.
            </p>

                I don't want to make this post too long, so I'll end it here and
                continue another day.

            I suppose I come from pretty much a feminist position, but I suspect
            it has more to do with what the woman in question has felt as an
            acceptable and inviting passion throughout their life.
            <br />

            <br />
            At a recent conference (<a
                href="http://www.tacticaltech.org/node/view/88"
                target="_blank"
                >Africa Source</a

            [<a
                href="http://mithrandr.moria.org/blog/category_africasource.html"
                target="_blank"
                >my web log entries about it</a
            >]), we had a lively discussion about gender issues in technology
            with not only a few real live girl geeks, but also someone whose
            real life work is dealing with gender issues in technology.
            Obviously, she's also coming from a feminist position, but her
            belief is that it has more to do with availability and
            (social/family) acceptability of opportunities to grow in the
            technical area.
            <br />

            <br />
            The issue of role models was another issue which most people there
            accepted as a major inhibiting factor in the acceptance of something
            as a passion; you're less likely to invest time and energy into
            something when you can't see yourself as the end result, which is
            something which role models provide.
            <br />

            <br />
            And finally, an inviting community and work place is necessary.
            <br />

            <br />
            I brought this together with my experience of race/culture issues in
            technology in South Africa, where we're trying to build a base of
            technically-excelling individuals from the races which have not had
            that opportunity before. Self-acceptance, social acceptance, work
            environment, and role models seem to be the key areas when the
            opportunity does present itself.
            <br />

            <br />
            This is less of an issue outside of Africa (I'm told) and similarly
            the gender issue is less pronounced in certain areas, such as the
            Scandinavian countries (or so I'm told).
            <br />

            <br />
            The argument from the other side really seems to be that girls have
            less of an inherent predisposition to this sort of work, or they're
            not tough enough to survive in the sometimes hot-headed and sexist
            IT community or workplace.
            <br />

            <br />
            The feminist response is that the former may or may not be valid,
            but it's unprovable while the latter is in place. Unless there's a
            safe and inviting environment for these girls to find themselves,
            you can't say they don't exist.

            A lot of IT office environments are very unhealthy places to work.
            Very competitive, emphasis on "stars" rather than well functioning
            teams, long hours culture, dysfunctional personality traits accepted
            and in many cases nurtured.
            <br />

            <br />
            I don't think it's just women that can be put off working in IT, a
            lot of men are not willing to put up with it either.
            <br />

            <br />
            Hopefully some more modern approaches like XP, which focus on
            communication, teams and sensible working practices (regular hours,
            limited overtime) will help encourage more people to consider IT as
            a career.

            Once upon a time (I can speak of the 1970s), computer programming
            was an unglamorous, low paying job. There were programming jobs at
            the time which just barely paid more than the US minimum legal wage.
            Many universities did not yet have computer science departments.
            <br />

            <br />
            There were many more women computer programmers back then. My first
            was working for the local school department (while still in high
            school), 2 of the 5 programmers were women.
            <br />

            <br />
            My second job was working for a then major software development firm
            doing hardcore realtime systems on minicomputers, 5 of the 8
            programmers in our office were female. And, out of the several
            hundred programmers in the company, nearly half were women.
            <br />

            <br />
            Women started disappearing from the field during the early 80s, at
            roughly the time programming became a well paying and popular career
            option. The new computer science departments were predominately
            populated by male professors and students, as was the emerging
            hacker culture that led to the development of the PC.
