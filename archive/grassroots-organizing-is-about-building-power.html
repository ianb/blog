                Is living your life in an individually responsible way enough to
                bring about the kind of change that you would hope for? I think
                the answer is no. It takes collective action. It takes mastering
                the tools of power, because there are very powerful institutions
                committed to making your preferred way of life impossible.

                There's a bad truism among certain activists that education is
                the key. The key to what? Like all truisms the idea is
                incomplete. Decades of valuing education over action have left
                social movements educated and impotent. Thinking about power is
                more important than thinking about education -- spreading
                information is only important if people will do something with
                that information. We've figured out how to spread the
                information, but people aren't doing anything with it.

                    It is perhps ironic, perhaps not (I am speculating some)
                    that we can look at the same issue - that of the forces at
                    work determining how we are to educate our children in the
                    future (the issue here is power, not education), and not
                    only be in opposition, but in opposition with both of us
                    convinced that we are the one fighting the interests of
                    powerful institutional forces, and pinning our hopes on
                    power at the grassroots level.

                    From my perspective, I am the one in luck. As the
                    educational system in the US is designed so as to retain
                    much of the power at the grassroots level- local government,
                    locally elected school boards, etc. There is more common
                    sense, than vision, determining outcomes at that level.
                    Which is fine with me, and exactly as it should be.

                    We, of course, happen to be living in the best of all
                    possible worlds ;)

                    Until we learn the basics of the organisation of our world,
                    we will be gropig in the dark and argueing about this that
                    are all far from the truth. You always need thought, will,
                    action. So education is important but until people are
                    trained to direct thier will to use the education we will
                    all be lost. Current education puts too much emphasis on
                    acquisistion of knowledge neglecting the importance of using
                    will to direct us to use the knowledge in action. So NO!! it
                    is neither struggle for knowledge nor struggle for power but
                    how to we use knowledge and power to advance humanity? We
                    have worked for too long against each other. &quot;Divided
                    we Fall!&quot;.
