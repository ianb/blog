                Short summary of PyCon... seemed much bigger this year. It
                <em>was</em> bigger, but I think it <em>seemed</em> bigger
                still. I guess what I found surprising was that the conference
                felt more dense despite its larger size. Most of the people were
                pretty well informed and quite invested in Python. In other
                years it felt like there were a larger proportion of people who
                were just checking out Python, or would have <em>liked</em> to
                do Python but weren't able to. I think of them as tourists, and
                this year there weren't that many.
            </p>
            <p>
                Probably the location had something to do with this too, as
                there wasn't a lot of local attendees. You have to be a little
                more serious to actual fly somewhere; in D.C. there were a lot
                of people there on a lark. So next year in Chicago I expect more
                local beginners.
            </p>
            <p>
                Another thing I like is that people seemed to really be using
                Python to do useful things. There wasn't nearly so much time
                spent talking about Why Python Is Good, or How To Sell Python To
                Your Boss. That's kind of silly anyway -- if you are at the
                conference, you don't need to be sold on it. But even so, the
                language seems to be in a much more self-confident place, and
                the users don't need to spend so much time justifying their
                choices. It's also good because Python's utility in the world
                isn't defined by its own attributes but instead by the things
                people do with it, and a lot of people are doing good things.
            </p>
            <p>
                Something I've noticed in general is that the term &quot;ready
                for the enterprise&quot; isn't being talked about as much; not
                just at the conference but generally. I'm happy about this --
                there was a tedious period of open source advocacy when people
                were way to obsessed with the enterprise. I think we have the
                <a
                    class="reference"
                    href="http://www.loudthinking.com/arc/000586.html"
                    >Rails narrative arc</a
                >
                to thank for some of that shift. Really &quot;enterprise&quot;
                means &quot;boring and obtuse&quot;, which in turn means
                &quot;someone will pay you to do this&quot;. And that's fine and
                well, but certainly not something worth fighting for, and
                definitely not what I want to see at a conference.
            </p>
            <p>
                I also feel like I've self-defined too exclusively with Python.
                It's a nice programming language, but it's just a programming
                language. And it's a nice community, but I should be part of
                other communities besides it. I'm not 100% sure
                <em>what</em> communities, or what conferences, but I guess I
                have to stretch a bit more.
            </p>
            <p>
                Anyway, a good conference. Next to

                    >North Carolina</a
                >. Oh damn, once again I mention it here far too late. Anyway,
                there I'll be sprinting on

                    If you are looking for another language community to join,
                    consider Haskell.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We are still pretty small, but the discussions on the list
                    and IRC are always interesting and low-heat.
                </p>
                <p>
                    That, and Haskell is the opposite of Python in many ways. So
                    (without applying too many prejudgements) it is likely to
                    stretch your mind more than other languages might.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Personally, Python and Haskell are the languages that have
                    had the most influence on my skills as a software developer.
                    Although, I still haven't learned a lisp flavor, so it might
                    be a little early to judge.

                        I'm not so much looking for another language, as a
                        community that isn't a language. Or a pan-language
                        community. To a degree &quot;the free software
                        community&quot; might be that community. But I'm not
                        sure what/where that community is. I think GNU used to
                        be a community, but I'm not sure if it is anymore. That
                        mission is either lost or satisfied.
