        <h1>HTML spellcheck</h1>
        <p>
            HTML comment boxes (or any TEXTAREA where we enter HTML) should have
            an HTML spellcheck. Not actually spelling (maybe that, but I've
            never seen one I liked). Instead it should check the HTML makes
            <i>some</i> sense. <tt>pre</tt> lines don't go too long. All the
            tags match up -- not necessarily valid XHTML, but a more forgiving
            version of validity. None of the links return 404. Everything that
            looks like a URL is also a link.
        </p>

        <p>
            To some degree the checker could fix things for you.
            <a href="http://www.lemburg.com/files/python/mxTidy.html">mxTidy</a>
            is a pretty good solution to most HTML validity problems. But if
            it's messed up enough (or gives a 404, for instance), there's no
            choice but to ask the user to fix it themselves. The hard part is
            setting up a program flow where you can requery the user, looking
            for corrections, give the user the corrected version, let them get
            their original version, ask them to correct problems that can't be
            automatically corrected, define a threshhold where you will correct
            for the user without confirming, and let the user indicate that they
            really want to do something you think they shouldn't (like maybe
            they'll want to link to a URL, knowing that it will go live very
            soon). Good stuff if you do it, though. Begging for a server-side
            HTML widget framework...

            bookmarklet:
            <a
                href="http://www.squarefree.com/archives/000033.html"
                target="_blank"

            >
            <br />

            <br />
            When you activate the bookmarklet, it checks all of the textareas on
            the current page and changes their background colour to green or red
            depending on whether or not they contain valid XML.
