<div class="document">
<p>SQLObject actually has, in its history, a great deal of similarity to
other Python ORMs.  Not just the whole wraps-a-database-thing (which
it obviously should have in common), but little implementation
details.  For instance, like PyDO and Django, it used to have a list
of columns (instead of using attribute assignment).  All of those
projects have changed since then... and probably in a similar way you
can lingering artifacts of that past implementation detail.</p>
<p>One of the ways is how the class is actually constructed.  This history
often reflects a past when a class was a mostly-dumb holder of a data
definition.  Then some outside code (the ORM itself) looks at the
class definition for special attributes, and constructs a bunch of
stuff.  So, for instance, though you do <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">name</span> <span class="pre">=</span> <span class="pre">StringCol()</span></tt> in
SQLObject, <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">StringCol</span></tt> is just a <em>description</em> of the column.  It
doesn't actually <em>do</em> anything, and if you later fetch
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">MyClass.name</span></tt> you won't get back anything related to <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">StringCol</span></tt>.
Because what is <em>actually</em> happening is that those descriptions are
collected, then the class is built.</p>
<p>This is something I'm trying to move away from in SQLObject, and I
think 0.8 will have some significant progress here.  One of the goals
of that progress is to make a distinction between SQLObject and
<a class="reference" href="http://rails.rubyonrails.com/">ActiveRecord</a>, (and, less direction,
from Django's ORM).  Because -- admitting that this is a
judgemental and subjective term -- I want SQLObject to be the most
Pythonic of these options.  Where Pythonic doesn't just mean
fits-the-language (can't expect a Ruby library to want to fit into Python)
but is a more generic term for Everything That Is Good In Programming.</p>
<p>In this case, there's a specific feature of Python I want to maintain:
backtracking.  Python's namespaces and tendency towards functions and imperative
code means that it's fairly easy, given a local bit of code, to
figure out what that code is doing in terms of the larger system.  You
can read code inside out, instead of having to figure everything out up front.
Metaprogramming on the whole tends to break
that, because you don't even understand the <em>dialect</em> of code you are
reading, not to mention where methods are implemented and what side
effects they might have.  So SQLObject already breaks backtracking; my goal
is to mitigate that.</p>
<p>One instance is joins, which have some annoying surprises in SQLObject
exactly because of the legacy of treatment of classes as declaration.  I
have a refactoring of joins (not yet checked in) that will hopefully
clear things up and generally simplify things.  Over on the TurboGears
list people wanted syntax similar to Django's for adding instances,
and it would have meant:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
class Person(SQLObject):
    addresses = MultipleJoin('Address')
p = Person.get(1)
p.addAddress(street='123 W 12th', ...)
</pre>
<p>I.e., the presence of that join would cause the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">addAddress</span></tt> method
to be created.  Seeing <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">addAdress</span></tt> in code, how would you figure out
what that did?  Well, you'd just have to be familiar with how the code
works, because <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">addAddress</span></tt> simply won't exist in any other
fashion.  But that's what I want to get away from; what will actually
go into SQLObject will be:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
class Person(SQLObject):
    addresses = OneToMany('Address')
p = Person.get(1)
p.addresses.create(street='123 W 12th', ...)
</pre>
<p>If you want to know what's going on, you look up
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">OneToMany.create()</span></tt>.  Well... sadly it won't be <em>that</em> easy, as
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">OneToMany</span></tt> is a <a class="reference" href="http://users.rcn.com/python/download/Descriptor.htm">descriptor</a>, and it
actually returns an object that delegates to <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">SelectResults</span></tt>.
There's still a lot to keep track of, and the challenge I'll have is
to figure out a way to present a wider set of core concepts than is
currently in the documentation (for instance, <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">SelectResults</span></tt> is a
really important class, but it's not documented and it's always
instantiated for you).  I'm thinking SQLObject docs should move towards a casual
overview, with deep links into generated documentation that is more
complete.</p>

<p>Why not treat the one-to-many join as what it naturally returns? A list. Let the user make natural Python list operations on the join and perform the necessary magic in the background. Rails ActiveRecord has a similar approach, and use Ruby list operators to deal with it to an extent.</p>
<p>It seems very natural and Pythonic to use Python list operators to deal with results that for all appearences are a list (though un-ordered).</p>

<p>I'll agree in general that using familiar list constructs is good.</p>
<p>Ian's example above is actually something that there is no Python list equivalent for: &quot;create&quot; would create a new instance (with the provided parameters, plus a parameter for the join column) and add it to the list. This is not the same as a simple &quot;append&quot;.</p>

<p>ManyToMany joins will use the set-like methods <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">.add()</span></tt> and <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">.remove()</span></tt>.  The fact that <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Set</span></tt> uses <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">.add()</span></tt> is the specific reason I named the method I showed as create and not add.  It's certainly my intention to make these recognizable to the degree possible.</p>

<p>Also, they are still lazily evaluated.  So you can apply methods like <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">.filter(extra_clauses)</span></tt> or <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">.orderBy(column)</span></tt> and these are evaluated in the database.  I think -- but still need to give it some thought -- that it will be good for &quot;natural&quot; joins as well.  E.g., if there's a ManyToMany join between Book and Author, you might do <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Author.select(Author.books</span> <span class="pre">&amp;</span> <span class="pre">Book.title.startswith('L'))</span></tt> to select all authors that have books with titles that start with L -- <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Author.books</span></tt> would evaluate (in that context) to the SQL join.  So that would kind of address a separate request at the same time.</p>

<p>Just tripped over this. Ian, I don't think you want to move way from what Active Record. It sounds like you want to embrace it:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
class Person &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
  has_many :addresses
end

p = Person.find(1)
p.addresses.create(:street =&gt; &quot;123 W 12th&quot;)
</pre>
<p>It's not too late, Ian. You're still much welcome in the Ruby camp. Ryan Tomayko is already finding himself more than comfortably accustomed :)</p>
