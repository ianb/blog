                                            actually <em>use</em> App Engine. I
                                            was able to come to terms with the
                                            idea of writing an application to
                                            the platform, but there are
                                            limits&#8230; and with App Engine
                                            there were simply too many limits.
                                            Geo stuff on App Engine is at best a
                                            crippled hack, I miss

                                            terribly, I never hated relational
                                            databases, and almost nothing large
                                            works without some degree of
                                            rewriting. Sometimes you can work
                                            around it, but you can never be sure
                                            you won&#8217;t hit some wall later.
                                            And frankly working around the
                                            platform is tiring and not very
                                            rewarding.

                                            So&#8230; App Engine seemed neat,
                                            but I couldn&#8217;t use it, and
                                            deployment was still a problem.

                                            What I like about App Engine: an
                                            application is just files.
                                            There&#8217;s no build process, no
                                            fancy copying of things in weird
                                            locations, nothing like that; you
                                            upload files, and uploading files
                                            <em>just works</em>. Also, you can
                                            check <em>everything</em> into
                                            version control. Not just your
                                            application code, but every library
                                            you use, the exact files that you
                                            installed. I really wanted a system
                                            like that.

                                            At the same time, I started looking
                                            into &quot;the cloud&quot;. It took
                                            me a while to get a handle on what
                                            &quot;cloud computing&quot; really
                                            means. What I learned: don&#8217;t
                                            overthink it. It&#8217;s not magic.
                                            It&#8217;s just virtual private
                                            servers that can be requisitioned
                                            automatically via an API, and are
                                            billed on a short time cycle. You
                                            can expand or change the definition
                                            a bit, but this definition is the
                                            one that matters to <em>me</em>.
                                            (I&#8217;ve also realized that I
                                            cannot get excited about complicated
                                            solutions; only once I realized how
                                            simple cloud computing is could I
                                            really get excited about the idea.)

                                            Given the modest functionality of
                                            cloud computing, why does it matter?
                                            Because with a cloud computing
                                            system you can actually
                                            <em>test</em> the full deployment
                                            stack. You can create a brand-new
                                            server, identical to all servers you
                                            will create in the future; you can
                                            set this server up; you can deploy
                                            to it. You get it wrong, you throw
                                            away that virtual server and start
                                            over from the beginning, fixing
                                            things until you get it right.
                                            Billing is important here too; with
                                            hourly billing you pay cents for
                                            these tests, and you don&#8217;t
                                            need a pool of ready servers because
                                            the cloud service basically manages
                                            that pool of ready servers for you.

                                            we each too easily find ourselves in
                                            a situation where deployments are ad
                                            hoc, server installations develop
                                            over time, and servers and
                                            applications are inconsistent in
                                            their configuration. Cloud computing
                                            makes servers disposable, which
                                            means we can treat them in
                                            consistent ways, testing our work as
                                            we go. It makes it easy to treat
                                            operations with the same discipline
                                            as software.

                                            Given the idea from App Engine, and
                                            the easy-to-use infrastructure of a
                                            cloud service, I started to script
                                            together something to manage the
                                            servers and start up applications. I
                                            didn&#8217;t know what exactly I
                                            wanted to do to start, and I&#8217;m
                                            not completely sure where I&#8217;m
                                            going with this. But on the whole
                                            this feels pretty right. So I
                                            present the provisionally-named:

                                            How it works: first you have a
                                            directory of files that defines your
                                            application. This probably includes
                                            a checkout of your
                                            &quot;application&quot; (let&#8217;s

                                            (by changing toppcloud), but

                                                with toppcloud. This installs
                                                all the basic standard stuff
                                                (things like Apache, mod_wsgi,
                                                Varnish) and some management
                                                script that toppcloud runs. This
                                                is written to be safe to run
                                                over and over, so upgrading and
                                                setting up a machine are the
                                                same. It needs to be a bare
                                                server, but

                                            From the outside it doen&#8217;t do

                                            either. I&#8217;ve included a lot of
                                            constraints in the tool but I think
                                            it offers an excellent balance. The
                                            constraints are workable for
                                            applications (insignificant for many
                                            applications), while still exposing
                                            a simple and consistent system
                                            that&#8217;s easier to reason about
                                            than a big-ball-of-server.

                                                believe there is a best
                                                practice. I might have gotten
                                                the best practice wrong, but
                                                that should be resolved inside
                                                toppcloud, not inside
                                                applications. Is Varnish a
                                                terrible cache? Probably not,
                                                but if it is we should all be
                                                able to agree on that and
                                                replace it. If there are
                                                genuinely different needs then
                                                maybe additional application or
                                                deployment configuration will be
                                                called for &#8212; but we

                                                better); there must be

                                                means we can also start to add

                                                these automatically. Mostly this
                                                isn&#8217;t so hard to do.

                                            are all well-greased and agile. The

                                            Unlike generalized systems like
                                            buildout this system avoids
                                            &quot;building&quot; entirely,
                                            making deployment a simpler and
                                            lower risk action, leaning on system
                                            packages for the things they do
                                            best. Other open source tools
                                            emphasize a greater degree of
                                            flexibility than I think is
                                            necessary, allowing people to encode

                                            code for each persistence technique,
                                            it is fairly easy to do, and there
                                            are no requirements for
                                            &quot;scalable systems&quot;; I
                                            think unscalable systems are a
                                            perfectly reasonable implementation
                                            choice for many problems. I believe
                                            a more scalable system could be
                                            built on this, but as a deployment
                                            and development option, not a
                                            starting requirement.

                                            So far I&#8217;ve done some
                                            deployments using toppcloud; not a
                                            lot, but some. And I can say that it
                                            feels really good; lots of rough
                                            edges still, but the core concept
                                            feels really right. I&#8217;ve made
                                            a lot of sideways attacks on
                                            deployment, and a few direct
                                            attacks&#8230; sometimes I write
                                            things that I think are useful, and
                                            sometimes I write things that I
                                            think are right. Toppcloud is at the
                                            moment maybe more right than useful.
                                            But I genuinely believe this is (in
                                            theory) a universally appropriate
                                            deployment tool.

                                            <strong>THERE IS NO SUPPORT</strong
                                            >. I cannot now, and I might never
                                            really be able to support this tool.
                                            This tool is appropriate for
                                            collaborators, for people who like
                                            the idea and are ready to build on
                                            it. If it grows well I hope that it
                                            can grow a community, I hope people
                                            can support each other. I&#8217;d
                                            like to help that happen. But I
                                            can&#8217;t do that by bootstrapping
                                            it through unending support, because
                                            I&#8217;m not good at it and
                                            I&#8217;m not consistent and
                                            it&#8217;s unrealistic and
                                            unsustainable. This is not a open
                                            source dead drop. But it&#8217;s
                                            also not My Future; I&#8217;m not
                                            going to build a company around it,
                                            and I&#8217;m not going to use all
                                            my free time supporting it.
                                            It&#8217;s a tool I want to exist. I
                                            <strong>very much</strong> want it
                                            to exist. But even very much wanting
                                            something is not the same as being
                                            an undying champion, and I am not an
                                            undying champion. If you want to
