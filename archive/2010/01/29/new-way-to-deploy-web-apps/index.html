                                    <em>less</em> as a result. Then I got

                                    the first thing that has really felt good to

                                    <em>use</em> App Engine. I was able to come
                                    to terms with the idea of writing an
                                    application to the platform, but there are
                                    limits&#8230; and with App Engine there were
                                    simply too many limits. Geo stuff on App
                                    Engine is at best a crippled hack, I miss

                                    terribly, I never hated relational
                                    databases, and almost nothing large works
                                    without some degree of rewriting. Sometimes
                                    you can work around it, but you can never be
                                    sure you won&#8217;t hit some wall later.
                                    And frankly working around the platform is
                                    tiring and not very rewarding.

                                    So&#8230; App Engine seemed neat, but I
                                    couldn&#8217;t use it, and deployment was
                                    still a problem.

                                    What I like about App Engine: an application
                                    is just files. There&#8217;s no build
                                    process, no fancy copying of things in weird
                                    locations, nothing like that; you upload
                                    files, and uploading files
                                    <em>just works</em>. Also, you can check
                                    <em>everything</em> into version control.
                                    Not just your application code, but every
                                    library you use, the exact files that you
                                    installed. I really wanted a system like
                                    that.

                                    At the same time, I started looking into
                                    &quot;the cloud&quot;. It took me a while to
                                    get a handle on what &quot;cloud
                                    computing&quot; really means. What I
                                    learned: don&#8217;t overthink it.
                                    It&#8217;s not magic. It&#8217;s just
                                    virtual private servers that can be
                                    requisitioned automatically via an API, and
                                    are billed on a short time cycle. You can
                                    expand or change the definition a bit, but
                                    this definition is the one that matters to
                                    <em>me</em>. (I&#8217;ve also realized that
                                    I cannot get excited about complicated
                                    solutions; only once I realized how simple
                                    cloud computing is could I really get
                                    excited about the idea.)
                                </p>

                                    Given the modest functionality of cloud
                                    computing, why does it matter? Because with
                                    a cloud computing system you can actually
                                    <em>test</em> the full deployment stack. You
                                    can create a brand-new server, identical to
                                    all servers you will create in the future;
                                    you can set this server up; you can deploy
                                    to it. You get it wrong, you throw away that
                                    virtual server and start over from the
                                    beginning, fixing things until you get it
                                    right. Billing is important here too; with
                                    hourly billing you pay cents for these
                                    tests, and you don&#8217;t need a pool of
                                    ready servers because the cloud service
                                    basically manages that pool of ready servers
                                    for you.

                                    Without &quot;cloud computing&quot; we each
                                    too easily find ourselves in a situation
                                    where deployments are ad hoc, server
                                    installations develop over time, and servers
                                    and applications are inconsistent in their
                                    configuration. Cloud computing makes servers
                                    disposable, which means we can treat them in
                                    consistent ways, testing our work as we go.
                                    It makes it easy to treat operations with
                                    the same discipline as software.

                                    Given the idea from App Engine, and the
                                    easy-to-use infrastructure of a cloud
                                    service, I started to script together
                                    something to manage the servers and start up
                                    applications. I didn&#8217;t know what
                                    exactly I wanted to do to start, and
                                    I&#8217;m not completely sure where
                                    I&#8217;m going with this. But on the whole
                                    this feels pretty right. So I present the
                                    provisionally-named:

                                    How it works: first you have a directory of
                                    files that defines your application. This
                                    probably includes a checkout of your
                                    &quot;application&quot; (let&#8217;s say in
                                    <tt class="docutils literal"

                                    >), and I find it also useful to use source
                                    control on the libraries (which are put in
                                    <tt class="docutils literal"

                                    >). There&#8217;s a file in

                                    You do not specify database connection
                                    details, for instance. Instead your
                                    application <em>requests</em> access to a
                                    database service. For instance, one of these
                                    services is a PostgreSQL/PostGIS database
                                    (which you get if you put

                                    etc., that will tell your application how to
                                    connect to the database. (For local
                                    development you can provide your own
                                    configuration, based on how you have
                                    PostgreSQL or some other service installed.)

                                    environment. It is setup so
                                    <em>every time</em> you start that
                                    virtualenv environment you&#8217;ll get
                                    those configuration-related environmental
                                    variables. This means your application
                                    configuration is always present, your
                                    services always available. It&#8217;s
                                    available in tests just like it is during a
                                    request. Django accomplishes something
                                    similar with the (much maligned)
                                    <tt class="docutils literal"
                                        ><span class="pre"

                                    but toppcloud builds it into the virtualenv
                                    environment instead of the shell
                                    environment.

                                    And how is the server setup? Much like with
                                    App Engine that is merely an implementation
                                    detail. Unlike App Engine that&#8217;s an
                                    implementation detail you can actually
                                    <em>look</em> at and change (by changing
                                    toppcloud), but it&#8217;s not something you
                                    are supposed to concern yourself with during
                                    regular application development.

                                    The basic lifecycle using toppcloud looks

                                        create any kind of supported server, but
                                        only Ubuntu Jaunty or Karmic are
                                        supported (and Jaunty should probably be
                                        dropped). This step is where the
                                        &quot;cloud&quot; part actually ends. If
                                        you want to install a bare Ubuntu onto
                                        an existing physical machine

                                        install; this tool is for clean systems
                                        that are used only for toppcloud.

                                        up (or update it) for use with
                                        toppcloud. This installs all the basic

                                        mod_wsgi, Varnish) and some management

                                        written to be safe to run over and over,
                                        so upgrading and setting up a machine
                                        are the same. It needs to be a bare

                                    stuff to manage the servers and change
                                    around hostnames or the active version of
                                    applications. It&#8217;s growing to fit a
                                    variety of workflows, but I don&#8217;t
                                    think its growth is unbounded.

                                    So&#8230; this is what toppcloud. From the
                                    outside it doen&#8217;t do a lot. From the
                                    inside it&#8217;s not actually that
                                    complicated either. I&#8217;ve included a
                                    lot of constraints in the tool but I think
                                    it offers an excellent balance. The
                                    constraints are workable for applications
                                    (insignificant for many applications), while
                                    still exposing a simple and consistent
                                    system that&#8217;s easier to reason about
                                    than a big-ball-of-server.

                                        Binary packages are supported via Ubuntu
                                        packages; you only upload portable
                                        files. If you need a library like lxml,
                                        you need to request that package (<tt
                                            class="docutils literal"

                                        you need a version of a binary library
                                        that is not yet packaged, I think
                                        creating a new deb is reasonable.

                                        There is no Linux distribution

                                        one way applications are run, because I
                                        believe there is a best practice. I
                                        might have gotten the best practice
                                        wrong, but that should be resolved
                                        inside toppcloud, not inside
                                        applications. Is Varnish a terrible
                                        cache? Probably not, but if it is we
                                        should all be able to agree on that and
                                        replace it. If there are genuinely
                                        different needs then maybe additional
                                        application or deployment configuration
                                        will be called for &#8212; but we
                                        shouldn&#8217;t add configuration just
                                        because someone <em>says</em> there is a
                                        better practice (and a better practice
                                        that is not universally better); there
                                        must be justifications.

                                        By abstracting out services and
                                        persistence some additional code is
                                        required for each such service, and that
                                        code is centralized in toppcloud, but it
                                        means we can also start to add
                                        consistent tools usable across a wide
                                        set of applications and backends.

                                        All file paths have to be relative,
                                        because files get moved around. I know
                                        of some particularly problematic files
                                        (e.g.,
                                        <tt class="docutils literal"
                                            ><span class="pre">.pth</span></tt

                                        files), and toppcloud fixes these
                                        automatically. Mostly this isn&#8217;t
                                        so hard to do.

                                    This is different than a strict
                                    everything-must-be-a-package strategy. This
                                    deployment system is light and simple and
                                    takes into account reasonable web
                                    development workflows. The pieces of an
                                    application that move around a lot are all
                                    well-greased and agile. The parts of an
                                    application that are better to Do Right And
                                    Then Leave Alone (like Apache configuration)
                                    are static.

                                    Unlike generalized systems like buildout
                                    this system avoids &quot;building&quot;
                                    entirely, making deployment a simpler and
                                    lower risk action, leaning on system
                                    packages for the things they do best. Other
                                    open source tools emphasize a greater degree
                                    of flexibility than I think is necessary,
                                    allowing people to encode exploratory
                                    service integration into what
                                    <em>appears</em> to be an encapsulated build

                                    updates really are small. It doesn&#8217;t

                                    production environment; but unlike some
                                    developer-oriented systems this does not try

                                    and instead relies on developers to set up

                                    unlike platform-neutral systems this can
                                    ensure an amount of reliability and

                                    rough edges still, but the core concept
                                    feels really right. I&#8217;ve made a lot of
                                    sideways attacks on deployment, and a few
                                    direct attacks&#8230; sometimes I write
                                    things that I think are useful, and
                                    sometimes I write things that I think are
                                    right. Toppcloud is at the moment maybe more
                                    right than useful. But I genuinely believe
                                    this is (in theory) a universally
                                    appropriate deployment tool.

                                    Now, the letdown. One thing I cannot offer
                                    you is support.
                                    <strong>THERE IS NO SUPPORT</strong>. I
                                    cannot now, and I might never really be able
                                    to support this tool. This tool is
                                    appropriate for collaborators, for people
                                    who like the idea and are ready to build on
                                    it. If it grows well I hope that it can grow
                                    a community, I hope people can support each
                                    other. I&#8217;d like to help that happen.
                                    But I can&#8217;t do that by bootstrapping
                                    it through unending support, because
                                    I&#8217;m not good at it and I&#8217;m not
                                    consistent and it&#8217;s unrealistic and
                                    unsustainable. This is not a open source
                                    dead drop. But it&#8217;s also not My
                                    Future; I&#8217;m not going to build a
                                    company around it, and I&#8217;m not going
                                    to use all my free time supporting it.
                                    It&#8217;s a tool I want to exist. I
                                    <strong>very much</strong> want it to exist.
                                    But even very much wanting something is not
                                    the same as being an undying champion, and I
                                    am not an undying champion. If you want to
                                    tell me what my process <em>should</em> be,
                                    please do!

                                        Good stuff. I think the simplicity angle
                                        is exactly right.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        At the moment this still fits into the
                                        &#8220;can&#8217;t quite use it&#8221;
                                        box for my work: too many of my client
                                        sites are still small enough to fit into
                                        a Webfaction shared host, and while
                                        cloud VPSes are cheap and getting
                                        cheaper, they still aren&#8217;t
                                        $5.50/mo; that extra $5-15/mo matters to
                                        my clients. And I deploy all of my
                                        in-development sites to a single Linode
                                        VPS for client collaboration work; those
                                        dev sites need to be up 24/7, and I
                                        can&#8217;t afford to buy a VPS for
                                        every client project in development. So
                                        I need a deployment solution
                                        that&#8217;s flexible enough to deploy
                                        (and behave nicely) on a multi-purpose
                                        VPS or shared hosting. I&#8217;ve built
                                        a solution with Fabric that does that
                                        (can transparently deploy to VPS or
                                        Webfaction in one step, uses Webfaction
                                        API to do the web server config). It
                                        certainly does have a lot more moving
                                        parts than this, though, and I&#8217;m
                                        sure it&#8217;s more brittle in many
                                        ways.

                                        Looking forward to playing with this,
                                        and to the day when cloud VPSes really
                                        are so cheap that I can use it
                                        regularly.

                                                toppcloud can host multiple
                                                isolated applications on a
                                                single server, so it should be
                                                entirely workable for you. Ben
                                                Bangert has noticed some memory
                                                issues that might lead to a
                                                constraint; if mod&#95;wsgi, for
                                                instance, was able to allocate
                                                processes dynamically that would
                                                help a lot. But it does not.
                                                mod&#95;wsgi does do some other
                                                stuff I want, though, like kill
                                                processes that aren&#8217;t
                                                responsive, and not much else
                                                does that. So&#8230; the
                                                solution isn&#8217;t quite
                                                right, and memory can get tight
                                                fast, but eh. It&#8217;ll take
                                                some hard work to fix that (but
                                                I really hope someone fixes it).

                                                Though the smallest Rackspace
                                                server is $10/mo, so it&#8217;s
                                                pretty darn cheap (Rackspace is
                                                about half the price of EC2 from
                                                what I can tell).

                                            <p>
                                                &gt; I’ve built a solution with
                                                Fabric that does that (can
                                                transparently deploy to VPS or
                                                Webfaction in one step, uses
                                                Webfaction API to do the web
                                                server config).
                                            </p>

                                            <p>
                                                I also have something like that
                                                going on, if you are interested
                                                in open sourcing it. Lets talk
                                                to get that rolling. I got
                                                several TurboGears installers
                                                for fabric. A common api for
                                                deploying stuff will be awesome.
                                                Then it could be integrated into
                                                toppcloud in some way.

                                    <p>
                                        I just want to say I&#8217;m totally in
                                        love with this idea. I started working
                                        on something similar but backward
                                        running in a virtual machine and
                                        building the server, as Carl also
                                        something build on fabric. And then
                                        hoping I could push that somehow to the
                                        cloud/server. Your approach is better
                                        and I really like the implementation,
                                        specially because you solve the
                                        complexity of running remote stuff with
                                        fabric. It can look a bit wacky but I
                                        totally enjoy the approach of services
                                        as things all apps have vrs apps as just
                                        a bunch of files. I have started playing
                                        around with this and patches are already
                                        going your way (hint check BB :)
                                    </p>

                                        I really think a set of default services
                                        should be grown with many things ranging
                                        not only from tools to use in your app
                                        (dbs, monitoring, etc.) but all the way
                                        up to firewall configurations and all
                                        &#8220;sysadmin&#8221; stuff we
                                        don&#8217;t really care about as
                                        developers.

                                        that provides with an excuse to try it
                                        out. :-)

                                    <p>
                                        I&#8217;d be very interested in seeing a
                                        system that works on any Linux-ish
                                        operating system that makes the
                                        deployment &amp; update cycle easy
                                        &#8212; not specifically anything in the
                                        cloud.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        For example, I have a host of
                                        applications I&#8217;d love to be able
                                        to update on foreign hosts via a simple
                                        <code>foo update .</code>. I think the
                                        problem is that Python people handle
                                        deployment in as many different ways as
                                        there are Python programmers, so you
                                        can&#8217;t really make many
                                        assumptions.

                                    <p>
                                        Thanks for this, there some interesting
                                        insights here. I agree with your view of
                                        cloud computing, it is a pretty simple
                                        concept that many business owners and
                                        the the populous at large still fail to
                                        grasp. As soon as cloud gaming and media
                                        sharing via cloud technologies becomes
                                        more popular though&#8230; I&#8217;m
                                        sure the majority of people will begin
                                        to understand. In reference to your
                                        mention of billing by the hour, I saw a
                                        Red Cross case study which spoke of
                                        their use of the cloud to scale-up their
                                        IT resources to help them deal with
                                        hurricane Katrina. It just goes to show
                                        that despite the simple concept, there
                                        are still a multitude of new uses for
                                        this technology waiting to be
                                        discovered.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>Keep up the good work! John.</p>

                                    <p>
                                        Our company uses a cloud service from
                                        Flexiscale which has a similar API,
                                        I&#8217;m unsure as to the exact
                                        differences but we use it to start up
                                        new servers and configure them for our
                                        clients apps. It&#8217;s nice being able
                                        to write applications that deploy and
                                        scale themselves with little or no
                                        supervision but in truth I think
                                        it&#8217;s beyond the means of a lot of
                                        developers or small teams to create
                                        their own deployment system for each
                                        project. We use a pre configured server
                                        image (usually a CentOs build) and our
                                        central server can simply ask for a new
                                        instance when it needs one and lets the
                                        app begin deploying new accounts on to
                                        the new virtual server. It&#8217;s time
                                        consuming to setup but it makes scaling
                                        a lot easier than before.
