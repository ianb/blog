        <h1>Command-Line Zope</h1>
        I'm sure people have done this many times before, but since I haven't
        stumbled upon it yet I just went and made my own
        <a href="https://ianbicking.org/software/zopen"
            >primitive command-line Zope client</a
        >. It creates, opens (via
        <a href="http://www.zope.org/Members/Caseman/ExternalEditor"
            >External Editor</a
        >), lists, and finds (by name or content) Zope objects. Besides External
        Editor it just uses wget and perl to scrape through web pages. (Perl?
        What was I thinking?) Of course, it only works on unix-like systems,
        because who else wants a command-line anyway? But that should include
        Mac OS X and Cygwin at least.
        <p>
            On a related subject, though I've been doing Zope development on an
            iBook I've been forced to do everything in a remote X session to a
            FreeBSD box. I just can't get external editor working like it should
            -- the AppleScript wrapper (described in the
            <a href="http://www.zope.org/Members/Feneric/ExtEditMacOSX"
                >MacOS Howto</a
            >) seems to make zopeedit.py slow and unresponsive, and unable to
            open more than one document at a time. The Macs MIME system makes
            adding the zopeedit.py application/x-zope-edit handler infeasible in
            all but Mozilla, and even Mozilla only works with this dumb wrapper.
            I'm sure someone (unlike me) who really knows how Mac applications
            are supposed to work would know how to do this the right way (which
            probably means making zopeedit.py a proper Mac application). Beats
            me though.

            Yes, that's an interesting project, but it's not the same as this.
            This program is entirely equivalent to the web interface (at least
            for the functions it supports), just translated to a command-line
            environment. No magic, no server side installation, no new dangers,
            no new powers.
