                I was looking at
                <a class="reference" href="http://fit.c2.com">fit.c2.com</a>,
                which was an idea of using Wiki style development to create
                acceptance tests. It's also probably there to avoid the tedium
                of writing one-off (test) code in Java.
            </p>
            <p>
                Anyway, the example style reminded me very much of
                <a
                    class="reference"
                    href="http://python.org/doc/current/lib/module-doctest.html"
                    >doctest</a
                >. I really like doctest, but it's really not a complete
                solution for testing. I feel like there should be other ways to
                express tests in the same spirit as doctest. Fit (at least, I
                assume that's the name of the framework) seems to have some more
                flexible ideas about testing fixtures. (Though of course
                doctest's other great feature is that the fixture for a test is
                minimal to the point of non-existance)
            </p>
            <p>Anyway, parallel developments are always interesting.</p>
