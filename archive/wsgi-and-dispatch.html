                on his blog (for background Mark Baker is an enthusiastic

                    >REST</a
                >
                advocate).
            </p>
            <p>
                While he was mostly positive about WSGI, he said this in a
                comment:
            </p>
            <blockquote>
                <p>This is the problem [with WSGI]:</p>
                <pre class="literal-block">
def application(environ, start_response):
</pre
                >
                <p>
                    Because it encourages bad practice with HTTP, such as those
                    apps that behave the same way to GET and POST requests (as
                    the examples in the article do).
                </p>
                <p>I think this would have been superior:</p>
                <pre class="literal-block">
def get(environ, start_response):
def post(environ, start_response):
def put(environ, start_response):
</pre
                >
            </blockquote>
            <p>
                Well, the first reason this doesn't work is fairly concrete. It
                would actually have to look like this:
            </p>
            <pre class="literal-block">
class Application:
    def get(self, environ, start_response): ...
    etc..
</pre
            >
            <p>
                because you can't pass a request to a set of functions, without
                somehow defining what the &quot;set&quot; is. You could also put
                them in a module, or some other container object. This opens up
                a whole bunch of messy and dull questions about how you traverse
                the container to get to the request method method.
            </p>
            <p>
                This also encodes request method dispatch into the spec, without
                encoding any other kinds of dispatch into the spec. The bad
                solution here would be to encode all kinds of dispatch into the
                spec. What WSGI got <em>really</em> right was that it has
                <strong>absolutely no dispatch</strong> in the specification.
            </p>
            <p>
                At the same time <em>implementing</em> dispatch in WSGI is
                really easy. Creating a dispatcher in a style like Mark suggests
                is rather difficult, because you have to do something like this:
            </p>
            <pre class="literal-block">
class Dispatcher:
    def dispatch(self, environ, start_response):
        return self.sub_object(environ)(environ, start_response)
    get = post = put = dispatch
</pre
            >
            <p>
                And of course you have to enumerate <em>all</em> the possible
                request methods. This is just silly, but it's become a common
                design misfeature in frameworks influenced by the Java Servlet
                specification (e.g.,
                <a
                    class="reference"
                    href="http://python.org/doc/current/lib/module-BaseHTTPServer.html"
                    >BaseHTTPServer</a
                >).
            </p>
            <p>
                The reason I think this misdesign seems reasonable is because
                other kinds of dispatch are assumed to have already occurred,
                and are opaque to the specification. WSGI does not make this
                mistaken assumption.
            </p>
            <p>
                The primary kind of dispatch that people do is based on the
                request path. I.e., if you do
                <tt class="docutils literal"
                    ><span class="pre">GET</span>
                    <span class="pre">/blog/archive/2006/10</span></tt
                >, first you have to figure out what
                <tt class="docutils literal"
                    ><span class="pre">/blog/archive/2006/10</span></tt
                >
                is. Here's the general way you do this in WSGI:
            </p>
            <ol class="arabic simple">
                <li>
                    Probably you start out by realizing that
                    <tt class="docutils literal"
                        ><span class="pre">/blog</span></tt
                    >
                    is the blog application, and you delegate the request there.
                    WSGI separates the path into two parts using the CGI
                    convention that the &quot;used&quot; part of the path is in
                    <tt class="docutils literal"
                        ><span class="pre">SCRIPT_NAME</span></tt
                    >, and the &quot;unused&quot; part is in
                    <tt class="docutils literal"
                        ><span class="pre">PATH_INFO</span></tt
                    >. So the blog app gets
                    <tt class="docutils literal"
                        ><span class="pre"
                            >SCRIPT_NAME=&quot;/blog&quot;</span
                        ></tt
                    >
                    and
                    <tt class="docutils literal"
                        ><span class="pre"
                            >PATH_INFO=&quot;/archive/2006/10&quot;</span
                        ></tt
                    >
                </li>
                <li>
                    How does the blog application parse its part? We assume only
                    the blog application knows the best way to do that. Very
                    possibly it does another prefixed based search on
                    <tt class="docutils literal"
                        ><span class="pre">/archive</span></tt
                    >, and then that resource in turn parses
                    <tt class="docutils literal"
                        ><span class="pre">/2006/10</span></tt
                    >. At different stages the results of this intermediate
                    parsing may go into the request in non-standard locations,
                    e.g.,
                    <tt class="docutils literal"
                        ><span class="pre">environ['routes.url_vars']</span></tt
                    >
                </li>
                <li>
                    Only after all these steps have happened is it likely that
                    <tt class="docutils literal"
                        ><span class="pre">GET</span></tt
                    >
                    has any meaning. Thankfully we've been allowed to totally
                    ignore the request method until this point.
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                Note that this specific example is not the only way it might
                work. For instance, we might have started with:
            </p>
            <ol class="arabic simple" start="0">
                <li>
                    First, look at the
                    <tt class="docutils literal"
                        ><span class="pre">Host</span></tt
                    >
                    header and dispatch on that.
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                This adds virtual hosting. Server environments that code step 1
                directly into their environment often have to create special
                exceptions for virtual hosting. Or:
            </p>
            <ol class="arabic simple" start="0">
                <li>
                    First, look at the
                    <tt class="docutils literal"
                        ><span class="pre">Host</span></tt
                    >
                    header, matching
                    <tt class="docutils literal"
                        ><span class="pre">(.*)\.myblogs.org</span></tt
                    >, and putting the matched value into
                    <tt class="docutils literal"
                        ><span class="pre"
                            >environ['myblogs.username']</span
                        ></tt
                    >
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                Now you can set up a wildcard DNS and get your blog app to look
                up the user based on that key.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you want to pay close attention to the request method, you
                are quite free to do so. WSGI does not tell you how, but it does
                not in <em>any</em> way hinder you from doing so. A good example
                of something that pays close attention to the request method is
                Joe Gregorio's
                <a
                    class="reference"
                    href="http://bitworking.org/news/wsgicollection"
                    >wsgicollection</a
                >, which could very well be the terminal point for some of these
                examples.
            </p>
            <p>
                <em>Because</em> WSGI does not include any form of dispatching
                it represents HTTP very accurately. HTTP does not lend special
                meaning to the request path. It does not say that different
                domains resolve to different servers. HTTP is a kind of message,
                and there are many ways to interpret that message. Low-level
                specifications overstep their bounds when they interpret those
                messages for you. WSGI is not an educational project, it is
                <em>infrastructure</em>, and an important feature is that it
                does not overstep its bounds.
            </p>
            <p>
                I'll also note that I think WSGI represents the HTTP message
                very well; the parts of HTTP that it leaves out are primarily
                about the HTTP <em>connection</em>, which are best handled by
                the actual connected-to-the-browser server. The rest of the
                message is all in there if you want to use it.

                        For one, it matters for the simplicity of a client
                        application. If the server implements REST properly,
                        then all the client needs to know is the URI for the
                        resource it's dealing with and then it basically knows
                        that it can do a GET or a POST or a DELETE or whatever
                        on that URI and the appropriate action will be taken. If
                        the server doesn't distinguish between GET and POST (or
                        the others) the dispatching to different functionality
                        has to be done via the URI, so the client then also
                        needs to know what URIs to hit for the equivalent
                        create/delete/update actions.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The other problem is that if the server doesn't
                        distinguish between GET and POST, then some client
                        somewhere is going to use a GET for an update because,
                        hey, it seems to work. Then a cache somewhere in between
                        might legitimately cache it. Or you get problems like
                        with the Google Web Accelerator that would delete all
                        the content on a site because there are
                        &quot;delete&quot; buttons with links to URIs that
                        delete a resource on a GET request and the GWA hits them
                        all because it <em>ought</em> to be safe to make GET
                        requests according to the specs.

                            counterproductive to force everyone to use
                            programming model they don't need just so that
                            someone else will not make a certain (well known and
                            understood) mistake. That's B&amp;D approach which
                            thankfuly is not in Python or WSGI style. import
                            this will give you a couple reasons what is.

                                It's not really B&amp;D: when you recieve a
                                request, you have to keep in mind what verb was
                                used because each verb guarantees different
                                kinds of behaviour. For instance, it's one thing
                                to treat GET and POST requests identically if
                                what you're doing to process the request fits
                                the kind of behaviour that's acceptable in
                                response to such a request, such as, say,
                                displaying a page, but quite another thing if
                                they don't, such as Anders' example of an
                                application allowing items to be deleted with
                                GET requests.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                However, as Ian outlined, such matters are a
                                matter for a higher-level framework than WSGI
                                and deciding them at WSGI's level would
                                complicate the interface between it and the
                                application or framework sitting on top of it.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                It <em>is</em> something that matters quite a
                                bit, but because of HTTP itself and not some
                                misplaced desire for B&amp;D. It's something
                                which ought to be in the minds of any
                                application developer because part of developing
                                a good application is using the underlying
                                protocol correctly. It's nothing to do with
                                forcing a programming model and everything to do
                                with passing the request onto another lump of
                                code smart enough to <em>really</em> know what
                                to do with it.

                                I want to be clear that I wasn't disagreeing
                                with Ian at all. I think he's absolutely spot on
                                that the dispatching on method shouldn't be done
                                at the WSGI level. It should be done by some
                                layer that's on top of WSGI (I use
                                wsgicollection for that, and it rocks).
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The point that I was making was just that GET
                                and POST are not interchangeable. They are
                                completely different operations with different
                                semantics. Adhering to standardized semantics
                                isn't B&amp;D, it's just interoperability and it
                                lets you make simpler clients and servers.

                <p>
                    Thanks for clearing up my failed attempt at Python; I've
                    only dabbled with it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You're right that this was partly inspired by Servlets, but
                    only insofar as I consider them to be a pretty good API for
                    HTTP that I've used successfully for a number of years. You
                    can use Servlets as you would use WSGI, by just overriding
                    the service() method, or you can use doGet, doPost, etc..
                    URI based dispatch can either be handled within service(),
                    or using any of the URI-dispatching tools the containers
                    typically provide (e.g. web.xml). So there's certainly ample
                    precedent for this form of API supporting the flexibility
                    WSGI seems to require. But <em>only</em> doing the
                    equivalent of service() (as WSGI currently does) places more
                    of the burden on remaining HTTP-friendly with what's built
                    on top. Perhaps that will work out, I don't know, but I
                    don't see much downside to such a framework constraining the
                    use of HTTP as I've described. But if it doesn't work out
                    for WSGI, and you have apps which, for example, don't
                    distingiush GET and POST, then you lose the ability to, say,
                    support cache management at the WSGI level. Providing a
                    Servlet-like API doesn't guarantee you that HTTP won't be
                    abused of course, but it does reduce the likelihood that
                    it'll be done accidentally.
