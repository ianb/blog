                                            As you can see, there can be a lot
                                            of tracing through code in this
                                            style. This has been called

                                            concepts like classes and methods to
                                            make sense of this kind of code,
                                            though if you look through my
                                            description you&#8217;ll notice they
                                            don&#8217;t show up; it is
                                            apparently somewhat frustrating for
                                            Alan Kay that he first used the term
                                            &quot;object-oriented&quot; when he
                                            would have preferred this
                                            message-oriented concept. Classes
                                            and methods are just implementation
                                            details. Messages and object
                                            references are the true fundamental
                                            concept.

                                            Doing this in the large means that a
                                            lot of these messages go over the
                                            network. It means we can get a
                                            handle to an object that lives on
                                            another computer. It
                                            <em>might</em> result in a system
                                            that is very chatty (many systems
                                            with transparent RPC do end up being
                                            unintentionally chatty). But it
                                            doesn&#8217;t have to. You can make
                                            this asynchronous to facilitate
                                            these kinds of efficiencies.

                                            That said, there is another distinct
                                            technique for programming in the
                                            large: document oriented
                                            programming. This is what REST is
                                            focused on: transmitting state in as
                                            complete a form as feasible, with
                                            explicit references whenever
                                            referring to another resource.

                                            Resources and objects are in many
                                            ways similar, but in other ways
                                            completely opposite. An object has
                                            behavior but no visible state. It
                                            responds to messages, passing more
                                            objects along. Resources themselves
                                            have no behavior. They are just bare
                                            state. REST and the web
                                            <em>kind of</em> adds behavior, but
                                            strict REST avoids even that. PUT is
                                            not behavior. PUT is almost like a
                                            declaration of fact. When you PUT to
                                            a resource you are claiming that the
                                            new state of the resource represents
                                            the truth of that resource. Any
                                            behavior that occurs because of that
                                            is hidden. Other resources may
                                            change as a result of the PUT, but
                                            this is not exposed in any way. To
                                            find out what&#8217;s changed you
                                            simply have to refresh all the state
                                            you&#8217;ve acquired &#8212; re-GET
                                            the resources. (POST, except when
                                            used simply to create a resource, is
                                            more like a verb than a statement of
                                            truth; the HTTP model is not pure in
                                            this respect.)

                                            For programming on a web scale
                                            resources have become the dominant
                                            technique. REST was really an
                                            acknowledgement of this idea, not
                                            the invention of it. It&#8217;s also
                                            an advocacy effort that our future
                                            work should be built on this past
                                            success. It&#8217;s been focused
                                            very clearly on advocating resources
                                            over the object/message-based
                                            systems of WS-*, but the WS-* design
                                            is hardly the first or only object
                                            based system of its kind; anything
                                            called &quot;RPC&quot; comes from
                                            that line of thinking. But now that
                                            WS-* isn&#8217;t king of the hill
                                            anymore maybe we can more be more
                                            thoughtful about how REST relates to
                                            other programming techniques.

                                            A way to describe the difference in
                                            terms of programming language design
                                            is that with resources everything we
                                            do is
                                            <a
                                                class="reference external"

                                                >call by value</a
                                            >. Resources are <em>values</em>,
                                            and we pass them around in their
                                            complete form. You can pass around a
                                            reference value (a URI), but this is
                                            like calling a function with a
                                            pointer argument. Object/RPC
                                            techniques are
                                            <a

                                            (though at some level there are true
                                            &quot;values&quot;, things like
                                            integers and strings, as things
                                            would simply be too chatty
                                            otherwise).

                                            One interesting place where objects
                                            and resources can overlap is in
                                            functional programming. Thinking in
                                            terms of call by value or call by
                                            reference, in a functional
                                            programming language these are
                                            identical. Because values are not
                                            mutable a value and a copy of the
                                            value are equivalent. You can also
                                            pass an object between systems by
                                            reference, in whole, or some lazy
                                            compromise where the object is only
                                            incrementally communicated between
                                            the processes.

                                            Resources are in a sense immutable
                                            regardless of your programming
                                            language. When you retrieve a
                                            resource you cannot modify it in
                                            place, as the result is no longer
                                            representative of what the resource
                                            really <em>is</em>. You can put a
                                            new resource in a named location
                                            (PUT), and you can copy resources
                                            (maybe making an internal copy).
                                            Incidentally this is why I think

                                            have a native representation of what
                                            a &quot;resource&quot; really is in
                                            programming languages, though
                                            usually this is not done. A resource
                                            should really be a document (content
                                            type, some bytes, perhaps a cache of
                                            parsed representations) plus the
                                            name (URI) and the <em>time</em>.
                                            Resources aren&#8217;t eternal, but
                                            given a time and URI there is (in a
                                            REST world) a single canonical
                                            representation.

                                            Further investigations of functional
                                            programming languages would probably
                                            be useful here. I believe strict
                                            functional languages have
                                            interesting metaphors for handling
                                            this kind of information; the
                                            eternal immutable sense of what a
                                            thing is at a point in time, and a
                                            way to reconcile the incomplete
                                            knowledge of what a resource is
                                            <em>right now</em>. I don&#8217;t
                                            think this is a clear pattern in
                                            Erlang, but is in Haskell.

                                            One useful aspect of resources is
                                            the ability to spy on the process,
                                            to get a snapshot of it, to
                                            understand it in a kind of literal
                                            way. This is <em>view source</em> in
                                            a browser, or just poking around
                                            with curl. You can feel a certain
                                            confidence that you can get a real
                                            sense of what the truth is using
                                            these tools. In an object-based
                                            system you can only poke around with
                                            a process of 20 questions, hoping
                                            that there isn&#8217;t some hidden
                                            truth that you are unaware of. For
                                            instance, talking to a proxy that is
                                            <em>almost exactly</em> like the
                                            original object, but with some small
                                            replacement. Of course internally a
                                            server can be peculiarly coupled as
                                            well, with relationships between the
                                            resources that aren&#8217;t explicit
                                            or obvious. But at least the faces

                                            I still haven&#8217;t fully figured
                                            out what distinguishes a document
                                            model from an object model, but I
                                            think the distinction between the
                                            two contains some interesting stuff
                                            worth exploring.

                                            a bit more analytically. I think

                                                a new process, and the process
                                                handles only one request. (You
                                                could also fork a new process
                                                each request with mostly the

                                                Worker processes, where a

                                                time, but the process is
                                                long-lived and will handle
                                                another request after finishing
                                                the first.

                                                handles multiple requests, each
                                                in its own thread. Threads may
                                                or may not be reused (depending
                                                on whether you use a thread
                                                pool), and that&#8217;s kind of
                                                like the difference between CGI
                                                and worker processes. But
                                                it&#8217;s not a big difference
                                                because either way the process
                                                is long lived, including all
                                                your objects.

                                                without threads. Typically your
                                                code is event driven: a request
                                                is an event, but so are things
                                                like &quot;database results
                                                returned&quot;, or &quot;file
                                                read from disk&quot;. Code takes
                                                the form of short snippets
                                                between these events.

                                            What people don&#8217;t realize is
                                            that PHP is effectively a CGI model
                                            of execution. People don&#8217;t
                                            appreciate this because PHP is
                                            implemented with mod_php, an Apache
                                            module. There are many other modules
                                            like mod_perl (the first of these
                                            mod_language modules), mod_python,
                                            mod_ruby, etc. None of these other
                                            modules are like mod_php. This has

                                            because they don&#8217;t get this.
                                            This is because the PHP language
                                            <em>was written for</em> mod_php.
                                            Perl, Python, Ruby &#8212; none of
                                            them were written to be used as an
                                            Apache module. You can&#8217;t take
                                            one of these existing languages and
                                            just retrofit it to be like PHP or
                                            like mod_php.

                                            CGI like model? Mostly because it
                                            lets two groups separate their work:
                                            system administration types
                                            (including hosting companies) set up
                                            the environment, and developer types
                                            use the environment, and they
                                            don&#8217;t have to interact much.
                                            The developers are empowered, and
                                            the administrators are not bothered.

                                                PHP processes can leak memory
                                                like crazy. It doesn&#8217;t
                                                matter because they only leak
                                                memory for one request.

                                                PHP processes can be easily
                                                killed if they act badly
                                                (sucking up too much memory or
                                                if they get caught in an
                                                infinite loop).

                                                PHP code has no global state. It
                                                has lots of global variables,
                                                but since they only live for one
                                                request they are relatively
                                                harmless. (Not entirely
                                                harmless, but what&#8217;s a
                                                major sin in another language is
                                                only a minor sin in PHP.) The
                                                process cannot become corrupted.

                                                There&#8217;s no global set of
                                                installed libraries (besides
                                                what PHP is compiled with). If
                                                you want to include a library
                                                you include files, typically
                                                relative paths. You won&#8217;t
                                                include someone else&#8217;s
                                                library accidentally. (This has
                                                changed in PHP, but the search
                                                path remains largely unused.)

                                                Most of the language is
                                                implemented in C, in a shared
                                                library. In comparison Python
                                                has &quot;batteries
                                                included&quot;, but those
                                                batteries are largely written in
                                                Python. Python code is not
                                                shareable, and can take time to
                                                load up. So while a single
                                                Python CGI script might be
                                                small, it probably imports lots
                                                of code which would have to be
                                                loaded each request. PHP scripts
                                                actually are small. (Stuff like
                                                <a

                                                changes this by adding
                                                substantial libraries written in
                                                PHP, but also seriously effects
                                                PHP performance.)

                                                PHP, and hosting companies have
                                                kind of figured out a consistent
                                                set of these libraries (stuff

                                            and even more contrary to the

                                            language communities. Python
                                            programmers <em>could</em> write all
                                            their libraries in C and start to
                                            make CGI scripts feasible, but they
                                            don&#8217;t and they won&#8217;t.

                                            about separating those two roles.
                                            Though even developer/administrators
                                            would benefit from a better story
                                            here because it would let them
                                            concentrate more on being developers
                                            and the administration part will
                                            start taking care of itself.

                                            Solving this is all the harder
                                            because of how it interacts with the
                                            language itself. But it&#8217;s not
                                            impossible. Process model 2 &#8212;
                                            worker processes &#8212; are
                                            feasible for most languages. You
                                            just need a really good process
                                            manager (including process setup for
                                            isolation, and process monitoring to
                                            mitigate problems). Apache
                                            <em>alone</em> is not this manager.
                                            <a
                                                class="reference external"
                                                href="http://www.fastcgi.com/"
                                                >mod_fastcgi</a
                                            >
                                            <em>could</em> be this manager, but
                                            it&#8217;s not. Maybe
                                            <a
                                                class="reference external"
                                                href="http://www.modwsgi.org/"
                                                >mod_wsgi</a
                                            >
                                            will become this manager for Python.
