                                    As you can see, there can be a lot of
                                    tracing through code in this style. This has
                                    been called
                                    <a

                                    classes and methods to make sense of this
                                    kind of code, though if you look through my
                                    description you&#8217;ll notice they
                                    don&#8217;t show up; it is apparently
                                    somewhat frustrating for Alan Kay that he
                                    first used the term
                                    &quot;object-oriented&quot; when he would
                                    have preferred this message-oriented
                                    concept. Classes and methods are just
                                    implementation details. Messages and object
                                    references are the true fundamental concept.

                                    Doing this in the large means that a lot of
                                    these messages go over the network. It means
                                    we can get a handle to an object that lives
                                    on another computer. It
                                    <em>might</em> result in a system that is
                                    very chatty (many systems with transparent
                                    RPC do end up being unintentionally chatty).
                                    But it doesn&#8217;t have to. You can make
                                    this asynchronous to facilitate these kinds
                                    of efficiencies.

                                    That said, there is another distinct
                                    technique for programming in the large:
                                    document oriented programming. This is what
                                    REST is focused on: transmitting state in as
                                    complete a form as feasible, with explicit
                                    references whenever referring to another
                                    resource.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Resources and objects are in many ways
                                    similar, but in other ways completely
                                    opposite. An object has behavior but no
                                    visible state. It responds to messages,
                                    passing more objects along. Resources
                                    themselves have no behavior. They are just
                                    bare state. REST and the web
                                    <em>kind of</em> adds behavior, but strict
                                    REST avoids even that. PUT is not behavior.
                                    PUT is almost like a declaration of fact.
                                    When you PUT to a resource you are claiming
                                    that the new state of the resource
                                    represents the truth of that resource. Any
                                    behavior that occurs because of that is
                                    hidden. Other resources may change as a
                                    result of the PUT, but this is not exposed
                                    in any way. To find out what&#8217;s changed
                                    you simply have to refresh all the state
                                    you&#8217;ve acquired &#8212; re-GET the
                                    resources. (POST, except when used simply to
                                    create a resource, is more like a verb than
                                    a statement of truth; the HTTP model is not
                                    pure in this respect.)

                                    For programming on a web scale resources
                                    have become the dominant technique. REST was
                                    really an acknowledgement of this idea, not
                                    the invention of it. It&#8217;s also an
                                    advocacy effort that our future work should
                                    be built on this past success. It&#8217;s
                                    been focused very clearly on advocating
                                    resources over the object/message-based
                                    systems of WS-*, but the WS-* design is
                                    hardly the first or only object based system
                                    of its kind; anything called &quot;RPC&quot;
                                    comes from that line of thinking. But now
                                    that WS-* isn&#8217;t king of the hill
                                    anymore maybe we can more be more thoughtful
                                    about how REST relates to other programming
                                    techniques.

                                    A way to describe the difference in terms of
                                    programming language design is that with
                                    resources everything we do is
                                    <a
                                        class="reference external"
                                        href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_by_value#Call_by_value"
                                        >call by value</a
                                    >. Resources are <em>values</em>, and we
                                    pass them around in their complete form. You
                                    can pass around a reference value (a URI),
                                    but this is like calling a function with a
                                    pointer argument. Object/RPC techniques are
                                    <a
                                        class="reference external"

                                    (though at some level there are true
                                    &quot;values&quot;, things like integers and
                                    strings, as things would simply be too
                                    chatty otherwise).

                                    One interesting place where objects and
                                    resources can overlap is in functional
                                    programming. Thinking in terms of call by
                                    value or call by reference, in a functional
                                    programming language these are identical.
                                    Because values are not mutable a value and a
                                    copy of the value are equivalent. You can
                                    also pass an object between systems by
                                    reference, in whole, or some lazy compromise
                                    where the object is only incrementally
                                    communicated between the processes.
                                </p>

                                    Resources are in a sense immutable
                                    regardless of your programming language.
                                    When you retrieve a resource you cannot
                                    modify it in place, as the result is no
                                    longer representative of what the resource
                                    really <em>is</em>. You can put a new
                                    resource in a named location (PUT), and you
                                    can copy resources (maybe making an internal
                                    copy). Incidentally this is why I think
                                    <a
                                        class="reference external"

                                    native representation of what a
                                    &quot;resource&quot; really is in
                                    programming languages, though usually this
                                    is not done. A resource should really be a
                                    document (content type, some bytes, perhaps
                                    a cache of parsed representations) plus the
                                    name (URI) and the <em>time</em>. Resources
                                    aren&#8217;t eternal, but given a time and
                                    URI there is (in a REST world) a single
                                    canonical representation.

                                    Further investigations of functional
                                    programming languages would probably be
                                    useful here. I believe strict functional
                                    languages have interesting metaphors for
                                    handling this kind of information; the
                                    eternal immutable sense of what a thing is
                                    at a point in time, and a way to reconcile
                                    the incomplete knowledge of what a resource
                                    is <em>right now</em>. I don&#8217;t think
                                    this is a clear pattern in Erlang, but is in
                                    Haskell.

                                    One useful aspect of resources is the
                                    ability to spy on the process, to get a
                                    snapshot of it, to understand it in a kind
                                    of literal way. This is
                                    <em>view source</em> in a browser, or just
                                    poking around with curl. You can feel a
                                    certain confidence that you can get a real
                                    sense of what the truth is using these
                                    tools. In an object-based system you can
                                    only poke around with a process of 20
                                    questions, hoping that there isn&#8217;t
                                    some hidden truth that you are unaware of.
                                    For instance, talking to a proxy that is
                                    <em>almost exactly</em> like the original
                                    object, but with some small replacement. Of
                                    course internally a server can be peculiarly
                                    coupled as well, with relationships between
                                    the resources that aren&#8217;t explicit or
                                    obvious. But at least the faces it projects
                                    are fully formed.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    I still haven&#8217;t fully figured out what
                                    distinguishes a document model from an
                                    object model, but I think the distinction
                                    between the two contains some interesting
                                    stuff worth exploring.

                                        Great post. Completely concur, but am
                                        reticent to use the term
                                        &#8220;documents&#8221; since a lot of
                                        people seem to think that implies XML or
                                        maybe HTML. Seems weird to talk about
                                        JSON &#8220;documents&#8221;.
                                    </p>

                                        I&#8217;ve been trying to push the term
                                        &#8220;data structures&#8221; for this.
                                        That&#8217;s not the best fit either, in
                                        general, but makes sense for JSON.

                                        The way I think about references, values
                                        and immutability is is collaborative
                                        documenting. Take a team of people
                                        developping a document together in a
                                        company. All documents are either stored
                                        on a common filesystem or sent as copies
                                        via email. If all modifications to the
                                        document result in new documents with
                                        new version numbers, then the documents
                                        are immutable. If multiple people are
                                        working on the same document, it&#8217;s
                                        a good practice to make a copy for each
                                        modification, so the path of
                                        modifications become apparent and no
                                        modifications are surrepticiously erased
                                        when two people save almost
                                        simultaneously. By mail, of course, the
                                        copies sent are values. Eventually no
                                        one knows which version is the right
                                        one. I think the best way of working is
                                        to save all documents in the same place
                                        (ressource) and send mails with
                                        references to that place.

                                        The hard part is, nevertheless, merging
                                        forked versions. This is adressed in
                                        version configuration systems because
                                        there are people assisting in the merge
                                        process, but there are no solutions that
                                        I know of for software archtitectures.

                                        given a time and URI there is (in a REST

                                        My immediate though in response to this,
                                        is that svn (or any other version
                                        control system), addresses this issue
                                        exactly. You can get a resource, as it
                                        is currently (HEAD), or you can retrieve
                                        a particular revision (URI+time).

                                    <p>Interesting thoughts there.</p>

                                    <p>
                                        Consider MFC document-view architecture
                                        also, the lines are blurred somewhat
                                        between objects and documents as you
                                        describe: there is the undo/redo history
                                        (state changes) and the view provides a
                                        complete snapshot of state at any one
                                        time. However, the document is
                                        undeniably an MFC object. I suppose the
                                        paradigm is dependent on whether
                                        you&#8217;re a user or a developer,
                                        whereas in REST architectures it&#8217;s
                                        the same&#8230;
                                    </p>

                                    <p>Interesting post.</p>

                                    <p>
                                        Speaking of document-oriented systems, I
                                        think that monads could make for some
                                        very interesting applications.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        In a document-oriented system (say an
                                        interactive web-app) written in a
                                        language like Haskell (where state is
                                        explicitly isolated), state (which would
                                        be contained in a set of monads) could
                                        be sent to the client with each
                                        response. The state could be something
                                        like a continuation.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        In this sense, one would have a
                                        continuation-based system (like
                                        <a
                                            href="http://seaside.st"
                                            rel="nofollow"
                                            >Seaside</a
                                        >), but instead of the state residing on
                                        the server, it resides with the client.
                                        So all documents (in the web-app) can
                                        remain immutable.
                                    </p>

                                        Researchers at Cornell have developed a
                                        stateless network stack based on this
                                        idea. It&#8217;s called
                                        &#8220;Trickles&#8221; (<a
                                            href="http://www.cs.cornell.edu/~ashieh/trickles/protocol.php"

                                        >).
                                    </p>

                                        This system will probably be impractical
                                        if the client state requires a lot of
                                        storage space. Perhaps a way around this
                                        problem is a hybrid approach where some
                                        state is sent to the client and where
                                        new documents are created on the server
                                        (using something like PUT) to represent
                                        the rest of the client state.

                                        But this is pretty much back to the
                                        Seaside model (although given my lack of
                                        knowledge of the inner workings of
                                        Seaside, I don&#8217;t know whether
                                        client state can be reified as a set of
                                        documents).

                                        The mapping between what you describe
                                        and Ian&#8217;s description of REST
                                        would seem to be &#8220;view -&gt; uri,
                                        (view,state) -&gt; (uri,tick)&#8221;.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>Really good stuff.</p>

                                    <p>
                                        The pair (uri,tick) can also be
                                        represented as object/document, at a
                                        uri. Immutable and reference-able
                                        resource.
                                    </p>

                                        &#8220;You can pass around a reference
                                        value (a URI), but this is like calling
                                        a function with a pointer
                                        argument.&#8221;
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        URIs are unlike pointers in that they
                                        don&#8217;t refer to the same
                                        &#8220;memory address&#8221;
                                        (call-by-value, your point),
                                        modifications are not necessarily
                                        symmetric. For immutable resources, you
                                        can ignore the distinction, but
                                        signalling a reference&#8217;s
                                        immutability isn&#8217;t something
                                        I&#8217;ve seen REST try to handle.
                                        (Caching with etag/if-not-modified does
                                        allow you to grossly detect when
                                        immutability becomes non-operative.)
                                    </p>

                                        URIs are like pointers in that we can
                                        perform some key operations without
                                        dereferencing a given uri. Relational
                                        join, index/hash lookup; metadata.
                                        Microformats, RDF, LinkedData are all
                                        focused around expanding the pool of
                                        data you know about things you may only
                                        have heard of, not yet seen or touched.
                                        In immutable/by-value, this property is
                                        perhaps associated with lazy evaluation.

                                        On the distinction between document and
                                        object models, inheritance is something
                                        to consider (or say, polymorphism, to
                                        stick with your intro&#8217;s avoidance
                                        of classes). Date and Darwen in Third
                                        Manifesto make a solid argument that an
                                        (object model with object-ids) cannot
                                        support an (inheritance model with
                                        generalization/specialization-by-constraint).
                                        It would be interesting to see if the
                                        differences between URIs and
                                        objectIDs/pointers remove that
                                        limitation.

                                        Probably more correct to say that HTTP
                                        doesn&#8217;t have a way of signalling
                                        immutability; REST doesn&#8217;t add
                                        anything like that to the equation
                                        anyway.

                                        This has come up before, on some other
                                        blog thread, because there are some
                                        fairly clear use-cases for it. The most
                                        obvious one I&#8217;ve run into is
                                        pre-packaged versions of huge JS
                                        libraries (dojo, yui), which, at least
                                        in production, you could certainly treat
                                        as immutable by using a version number
                                        in the URL itself (presumably a
                                        directory name).

                                        Your Smalltalk code is wrong, it should
                                        be:

</code></pre>

                                        note the colon on the first buddy, the
                                        period is actually optional

                                        Starting from a more mundane origin, the
                                        web.py framework gives you controllers
                                        with methods corresponding to HTTP
                                        methods, which is a good starting point
                                        for designing a web app. around the
                                        notion of resources. But what when you
                                        want to compose a web page out of
                                        multiple resources; it would be nice to
                                        be able to call the corresponding web.py
                                        controllers via their externally facing
                                        methods.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        Unfortunately you don&#8217;t know what
                                        the side effects will be &#8211; a
                                        controller you call might start sending
                                        undesirable HTTP headers such as
                                        content-length. Also it would be nice,
                                        if the call would be rather more than
                                        just a method-call; acting like an HTTP
                                        client, calling a server so, for
                                        example, caching headers can be
                                        employed. So perhaps it would be nice to
                                        unify fetching a remote resource with
                                        fetching one &#8220;internally&#8221;
                                        from memory.

                                        Meanwhile, given a URI for a resource
                                        and it&#8217;s value (the document),
                                        HTTP provides mechanisms for comparing
                                        the value you currently have the source
                                        you got it from, from modification time
                                        to direct comparison via something
                                        checksum-like (E-Tags). In most
                                        programming languages, when you receive
                                        a copy of some variable, you first
                                        don&#8217;t really have a way to know
                                        it&#8217;s source and comparisons of
                                        values may be [difficult and
                                        expensive](<a

                                    <p>Great post.</p>

                                    <p>
                                        I liked the way you started with late
                                        binding.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        The fact is, the resource model (eg.
                                        web) gives up on late-binding, gives up
                                        on polymorphism (there&#8217;s no
                                        ambiguity about what&#8217;s at the end
                                        of the URL), and doesn&#8217;t really
                                        encapsulate <em>behaviour</em> much at
                                        all.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>That turns out to be OK.</p>

                                    <p>
                                        But does it, in fact, turn out to be OK
                                        because the web as we understand it
                                        simply doesn&#8217;t have much
                                        behaviour? And so ReST is sufficient to
                                        keep it under-control?
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        Or does it turn out to be OK because, in
                                        fact, the extra complexity of managing
                                        the indirection needed to give you
                                        later-binding makes it impossible to
                                        scale? And so programming in the largest
                                        large means giving up on hopes of
                                        polymorphism altogether &#8230; and so
                                        living with the redundancy?

                                    <p>
                                        Like many have pointed out, if you think
                                        of document/resource based system as a
                                        version/difference system, then we can
                                        easily see the differences between the
                                        resource and the object model. In its
                                        purest form a REST/resource based model
                                        can be seen as an explicit state
                                        representation. You &#8220;do&#8221;
                                        something to the state by adding or
                                        moving things (documents) around (think
                                        of destruction of the state as a
                                        relocation of resource, maybe to
                                        /dev/null?). You have a full history of
                                        what is going on and things are always
                                        additive. Mixing in the time dimension,
                                        (current) state of the system is
                                        basically a snapshot of what you have
                                        added to the system so far. If you stop
                                        in time, and check out (punt intended)
                                        the &#8220;current&#8221; state of the
                                        system and how it&#8217;s functioning,
                                        there is no difference between
                                        object-based and resource-based systems.
                                        However, with a resource-based system,
                                        you have (or at least in theory) the
                                        whole history of what you&#8217;ve have
                                        done. You can look at states other than
                                        the &#8220;current&#8221; one to compare
                                        and contrast what your have done. Where
                                        as an object-based system tend to
                                        confine you to only the current state,
                                        and you have to infer what has happened.
                                        Maybe this is why you can &#8220;feel a
                                        certain confidence&#8221; towards a
                                        resource-based system, or you &#8220;can
                                        get a real sense of what the truth
                                        is&#8221;. But do keep in mind that too
                                        much information can overwhelm a system
                                        and its users. There is always a
                                        balance/trade-off in an imperfect world.
                                        Maybe we should start thinking about
                                        what all these mean in quantum
                                        computing&#8230; hm&#8230; the
                                        possibilities&#8230; :)

                                        &#8220;An object has behavior but no
                                        visible state&#8221;

                                        In REST you want to represent the state
                                        so that you can transfer it over the
                                        network (yeah, duh). In many forms of
                                        programming we often work almost
                                        exclusively with objects. Since the
                                        state of an object is encapsulated by
                                        behaviour it can feel like trying to
                                        thread a needle with oven mitts on,
                                        &#8220;dear object, tell me what you are
                                        so that I may better represent
                                        you!&#8221;
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        &#8220;In an object-based system you can
                                        only poke around with a process of 20
                                        questions, hoping that there isn&#8217;t
                                        some hidden truth that you are unaware
                                        of. For instance, talking to a proxy
                                        that is almost exactly like the original
                                        object, but with some small replacement.
                                        Of course internally a server can be
                                        peculiarly coupled as well, with
                                        relationships between the resources that
                                        aren&#8217;t explicit or obvious. But at
                                        least the faces it projects are fully
                                        formed.&#8221;
                                    </p>

                                        Ha! Twenty questions is a good analogy.
                                        Objects can act according to
                                        Heisenberg&#8217;s uncertainty
                                        principle, whereby the act of observing
                                        an object changes the object itself.
                                        This can be mitigated if you do not
                                        treat all objects as conceptually equal.
                                        If you have a category of objects whose
                                        only purpose is to describe the outward
                                        face of another object &#8211; including
                                        a description of state of the object it
                                        describes, then you don&#8217;t need to
                                        play 20 questions with an object to get
                                        a sense of an objects outward face. COM
                                        and zope.interface/zope.schema provide
                                        such things, but then these are only
                                        loose promises of what they
                                        <em>think</em> the state of an object
                                        is. If your object is a proxy object or
                                        has other comlexities then when it comes
                                        time to extract state it may not be what
                                        you expect.

                                        In these ways of thinking we say
                                        interface and implementation. A
                                        description of behaviour (interface) and
                                        the many possibilities of that behaviour
                                        (implementation). There are interesting
                                        parallels between this and resources and
                                        documents. A state (document) and the
                                        many possibilities of that state over
                                        time (resource).
