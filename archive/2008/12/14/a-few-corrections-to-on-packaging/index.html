                                    category errors. Figuring out where all the
                                    pieces in Setuptools (and pip and
                                    virtualenv) fit <em>is</em> difficult, so I
                                    don&#8217;t blame James for making some

                                        other metadata too (description,
                                        version, etc), and Setuptools adds to
                                        that metadata some. Distutils
                                        doesn&#8217;t make it very easy to add
                                        to the metadata &#8212; it&#8217;ll
                                        whine a little about things it

                                        anything with that extra data. Fixing
                                        this problem in Distutils is an
                                        important aspect of Setuptools, and part
                                        of what Distutils itself unsuitable as a
                                        basis for good library management.

                                        This is something you import. It is not
                                        the same as a distribution, though
                                        usually a distribution will have the
                                        same name as a package. In my own
                                        libraries I try to name the distribution
                                        with mixed case (like Paste) and the
                                        package with lower case (like paste).
                                        Keeping the terminology straight here is
                                        <em>very</em> difficult; and usually it
                                        doesn&#8217;t matter, but sometimes it
                                        does.

                                        monkeypatching distutils, so simply
                                        importing setuptools activates its
                                        functionality from then on. This package
                                        is entirely focused on installation and
                                        package management, it is not something
                                        you should use at runtime (unless you
                                        are installing packages as your runtime,
                                        of course).

                                        Distribution, and is for use at runtime.
                                        This is a single module that provides
                                        the ability to query what distributions
                                        are installed, metadata about those
                                        distributions, information about the
                                        location where they are installed. It
                                        also allows distributions to be
                                        &quot;activated&quot;. A
                                        <em>distribution</em> can be available
                                        but not activated. Activating a
                                        distribution means adding its location
                                        to

                                        easy_install. Almost everything that
                                        allows different libraries to be
                                        installed, or allows different versions
                                        of libraries, does it through some
                                        management of sys.path. pkg_resources
                                        also allows for generic access to
                                        &quot;resources&quot; (i.e., non-code
                                        files), and let&#8217;s those resources
                                        be in zip files. pkg_resources is safe
                                        to use, it doesn&#8217;t do any of the
                                        funny stuff that people get annoyed
                                        with.

                                        version requirement. It then downloads

                                        This is an alternative to easy_install.
                                        It works <em>somewhat</em> differently
                                        than easy_install, but not much. Mostly
                                        it is <em>better</em> than easy_install,
                                        in that it has some extra features and
                                        is easier to use. Unlike easy_install,
                                        it downloads all distributions up-front,
                                        and generates the metadata to read
                                        distribution and version requirements.
                                        It uses Setuptools to generate this
                                        metadata from a setup.py file, and uses
                                        pkg_resources to parse this metadata. It
                                        then installs packages
                                        <em

                                        installs eggs! I&#8217;ve heard the many
                                        complaints about easy_install (and
                                        I&#8217;ve had many myself), but
                                        ultimately I think pip does well by just
                                        fixing a few small issues. Pip is
                                        <em>not</em> a repudiation of Setuptools
                                        or the basic mechanisms that
                                        easy_install uses.

                                        This is a defunct package that had some
                                        of the features of pip (particularly
                                        requirement files) but used easy_install
                                        for installation. Don&#8217;t bother
                                        with this, it was just a bridge to get
                                        to pip.

                                        standard library. It also installs
                                        Setuptools to make it easier to
                                        bootstrap the environment (because
                                        bootstrapping Setuptools is itself a bit
                                        tedious). I&#8217;ll add pip to it too
                                        sometime. Using virtualenv you
                                        don&#8217;t have to worry about
                                        different library versions, because for
                                        any one environment you will probably
                                        only need one version of a library. On
                                        any one <em>machine</em> you probably
                                        need different versions, which is why
                                        installing packages system-wide is
                                        problematic for most libraries.
                                        (I&#8217;ve been meaning to write a post
                                        on why I think using system packaging
                                        for libraries is counter-productive, but
                                        that&#8217;ll wait for another time.)

                                    before Setuptools.

                                    There are a few things that I think people
                                    really dislike about Setuptools.

                                    First, zip files. Setuptools prefers zip
                                    files, for reasons that won&#8217;t mean
                                    much to you, and maybe are more historical
                                    than anything. When a distribution
                                    doesn&#8217;t indicate if it is zip-safe,
                                    Setuptools looks at the code and sees if it
                                    uses
                                    <tt class="docutils literal"
                                        ><span class="pre">__file__</span></tt
                                    >, an if not it presumes that the code is
                                    probably zip-safe. The specific problem
                                    James cites is what appears to be a bug in
                                    Django, that Django looks for code and
                                    can&#8217;t traverse into zip files in the
                                    same way that Python itself can. Setuptools
                                    didn&#8217;t itself add anything to Python
                                    to make it import zip files, that
                                    functionality was added to Python some time
                                    before. The zipped eggs that Setuptools
                                    installs are using existing (standard!)
                                    Python functionality.

                                    That said, I don&#8217;t think zipping
                                    libraries up is all that useful, and while
                                    it <em>should</em> work, it doesn&#8217;t
                                    always, and it makes code harder to inspect
                                    and understand. So since it&#8217;s not that
                                    useful, I&#8217;ve disabled it when pip
                                    installs packages. I also have had it
                                    disabled on my own system for years now, by

                                    in it. Sadly App Engine is forcing me to use
                                    zip files again, because of its absurdly
                                    small file limits&#8230; but that&#8217;s a
                                    different topic. (There is an experimental
                                    <tt class="docutils literal"

                                    command mostly intended for App Engine.)

                                    Another pain point is version management
                                    with
                                    <tt class="docutils literal"

                                    and Setuptools. Indeed it is easy to get
                                    things messed up, and it is easy to piss
                                    people off by overspecifying, and sometimes
                                    things can get in a weird state for no good
                                    reason (often because of
                                    easy_install&#8217;s rather naive
                                    leap-before-you-look installation order).
                                    Pip fixes that last point, but it also tries
                                    to suggest more constructive and less
                                    painful ways to manage other pieces.
                                </p>

                                    Pip requirement files are an assertion of
                                    <strong>versions that work together</strong
                                    >. setup.py requirements (the Setuptools
                                    requirements) should contain two things:
                                    <strong>1</strong>: all the libraries used
                                    by the distribution (without which
                                    there&#8217;s no way it&#8217;ll work) and
                                    <strong>2</strong>: exclusions of the
                                    versions of those libraries that are
                                    <strong>known not to work</strong>. setup.py
                                    requirements should not be viewed as an
                                    assertion that by satisfying those
                                    requirements everything <em>will</em> work,
                                    just that it <em>might</em> work. Only the
                                    end developer, testing the system together,
                                    can figure out if it really works. Then pip
                                    gives you a way to record that working set
                                    (using

                                    library.

                                    There&#8217;s also a lot of conflicts
                                    between Setuptools and package maintainers.
                                    This is kind of a proxy war between
                                    developers and sysadmins, who have very
                                    different motivations. It deserves a post of
                                    its own, but the conflicts are about more
                                    than just how Setuptools is implemented.

                                    I&#8217;d love if there was a
                                    language-neutral library installation and
                                    management tool that really worked. Linux
                                    system package managers are absolutely not
                                    that tool; frankly it is absurd to even
                                    consider them as an alternative. So for now
                                    we do our best in our respective language
                                    communities. If we&#8217;re going to move
                                    forward, we&#8217;ll have to acknowledge
                                    what&#8217;s come before, and the reasoning
                                    for it.

                                    <p>
                                        I am new to pip, so I hope I don&#8217;t
                                        write silly things ;)
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        It&#8217;s a good idea to have the
                                        requirements outside the package,
                                        instead of what setuptools does. So you
                                        can share them amongst several packages.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        So basically, pip&#8217;s requirements
                                        files are what Zope calls the
                                        &#8220;Known Good Set&#8221; and what
                                        Turbogears 2 does by maintaining its own
                                        PyPI server to distribute TG2 packages :
                                        a list of versions that are known to
                                        interact well in the same environment,
                                        right ?
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        But it&#8217;s not really different from
                                        setuptools there, except that you change
                                        the requirements in a different place if
                                        something goes wrong.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        So to simplify the problem,
                                        couldn&#8217;t we have juste ONE
                                        requirement file in the whole Python ?
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        This could be the clue for os packagers
                                        : they would be able to tweak this file,
                                        while developers would be able to try
                                        out their package over different
                                        requirements files (&#8220;the debian
                                        etch python requirement file&#8221;
                                        &#8220;the debian unstable python
                                        requirement file&#8221;, etc). And for
                                        specific, isolated stuff, using
                                        virtualenv would allow developer to have
                                        their own custome requirement files.

                                            I’d love if there was a

                                            installation and management tool
                                            that really worked. Linux system
                                            package managers are absolutely not
                                            that tool; frankly it is absurd to
                                            even consider them as an
                                            alternative.

                                        Can you perhaps elaborate on that? It
                                        seems that apt, for instance is
                                        <em>exactly</em> that. Its language
                                        neutral. Its installs and manages
                                        libraries from various languages and
                                        according to the majority of the
                                        packages on my server, it works. The
                                        only two downsides to something like apt
                                        is A) its platform specific and B) they
                                        include new things on a timeline, not
                                        constantly.

                                        Another problem Linux system package
                                        managers might face is the concept of
                                        environments. I&#8217;m not sure how
                                        they deal with this other than maybe
                                        allowing an installation prefix, but
                                        even then, system-wide you can probably
                                        only install one version of the package
                                        at one prefix. I know with BSD ports you
                                        can at least have more than one version
                                        installed, but you have to
                                        activate/deactivate them individually.
                                        There needs to be a way to have
                                        completely independent environments, but
                                        I&#8217;m not experienced enough to know
                                        if this is currently possible or

                                        Justin, I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s
                                        possible to have multiple versions of
                                        the same library installed via apt,
                                        correct?
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        Ian (and others) definitely need that
                                        ability, as it&#8217;s one of the main
                                        purposes of virtualenv. ;)
                                    </p>

                                    <pre><code>/apps/foo/lib/python2.5/django (0.96)
/apps/bar/lib/python2.5/django (1.0.2)
</code></pre>

                                    <p>
                                        That&#8217;s a simple example with a
                                        single requirement, but imagine that
                                        each of those apps/projects/sites all
                                        had their own complicated stacks. I
                                        don&#8217;t know how you&#8217;d manage
                                        that with apt.
                                    </p>

                                        Another benefit is, like you said, the
                                        timeline. As Python developers
                                        it&#8217;s unlikely that most of us roll
                                        our kernel, or compile most of our own
                                        C-level-system-libraries or what have
                                        you, so whatever our distribution
                                        provides is good enough for 99.9% of the
                                        use cases. But when it comes to my
                                        Python app, I&#8217;m much more familiar
                                        and may know that the psycopg version
                                        that&#8217;s available fixes many
                                        problems over that of the one included
                                        in the latest Ubuntu, and so I&#8217;m
                                        more likely to want to manage that
                                        myself. It&#8217;s higher on the stack
                                        where small versions changes matter more
                                        to me.

                                        package managers are inappropriate
                                        because they don&#8217;t allow multiple
                                        versions of packages to be installed,
                                        local environments, and ad hoc packages.

                                        The Linux package managers do good
                                        things, but two are very important. One
                                        is that they record the existence of
                                        files so you can check the package is
                                        correctly installed, hasn&#8217;t been
                                        altered, and can uninstall. (Do a Google
                                        search for easy_install uninstall to see
                                        how people get frustrated at being
                                        unable to uninstall). Secondly they hook
                                        into update mechanisms so updates happen
                                        as appropriate for security and
                                        functionality reasons. If those
                                        important capabilities are ignored then
                                        we&#8217;ll end up with the Windows
                                        situation with detritus all over your
                                        system and numerous update daemons

                                        The exact same situation arose with CPAN
                                        vs package managers. It would be
                                        worthwhile surveying that to see what
                                        worked and what didn&#8217;t. The
                                        solutions mostly seemed to be some sort
                                        of wrapper that would turn CPAN packages
                                        into native platform packages, although
                                        that doesn&#8217;t solve the update
                                        issue.

                                        Perhaps PyPI should be doing something
                                        like Ubuntu/Launchpad PPAs where
                                        packages can be automatically built for
                                        multiple platforms and trivially
                                        integrated into Debian/Ubuntu/apt style
                                        package managers. The same approach
                                        would work for RPM and even Windows
                                        although one updater would need to be
                                        picked as the blessed updater mechanism
                                        since there isn&#8217;t a standard one.

                                        Ian, the Django case is one where, for
                                        <em>most</em> of the operations
                                        involved, we use standard
                                        <code>__import__</code> and
                                        <code>imp.find_module</code>, but for
                                        one specific case (having determined
                                        where custom commands are, get a list of
                                        all of them) we fall back to an
                                        old-fashioned <code>os.listdir</code>.
                                        And that&#8217;s where a zipped egg
                                        trips it up, and a place where
                                        setuptools can&#8217;t recognize
                                        there&#8217;s a problem (since
                                        there&#8217;s no reference to
                                        <code>__file__</code> in the relevant
                                        code). I&#8217;m not sure that (on the
                                        one hand) special-casing zip files and
                                        using the <code>zipfile</code> module to
                                        introspect them or (on the other) trying
                                        to use the associated APIs coming from
                                        the setuptools frameworks would be the
                                        right solution there.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        And as I&#8217;ve said, I much prefer
                                        pip&#8217;s requirements files to
                                        setuptools&#8217; attempt to graft
                                        dependencies into setup.py; pointing
                                        people at a file which lists everything
                                        they need, and which a tool can use as
                                        the basis for a repeatable install,
                                        seems to me a much more sane way to do
                                        things.

                                        In an attempt to rid myself of
                                        easy-install, I&#8217;m trying to
                                        understand some things. First, pip
                                        isn&#8217;t intended as a setuptools
                                        replacement, right? I mean, it actually
                                        uses setuptools components, if I&#8217;m
                                        not mistaken. The way I understand it is
                                        that it&#8217;s meant to be a
                                        replacement for the easy-install
                                        functionality of setuptools. So things
                                        like install-requires in the setup
                                        command is still ok to use? If not, what
                                        is the preferred alternative? I just
                                        want to understand what I should be
                                        staying away from.

                                    <p>Hey Ian,</p>

                                    <p>
                                        This is an excellent and unbiased
                                        summary. More or less the missing manual
                                        of the current state of packaging under
                                        Python.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        I need to add that I really like pip. It
                                        doesn&#8217;t change much to
                                        easy_install, but it is day an night to
                                        me. Thanks for making it available.
                                    </p>

                                        Jeremy: correct, pip uses Setuptools
                                        (quite a bit). I also recommend using
                                        install_requires, as mentioned in the
                                        article: use it to indicate the absolute
                                        minimum other things you need for the
                                        library to work. This will get a new
                                        developer on a new project up and
                                        running with something workable,
                                        avoiding unnecessary installation
                                        confusion or long recipes. As you share
                                        or deploy your project, building up a
                                        requirements file will let other people
                                        reproduce your work.

                                        For those wondering, the Debian tools do
                                        allow you to install packages into
                                        numerous different places: that&#8217;s
                                        how tools like pbuilder manage to
                                        function. And with fakeroot and
                                        fakechroot you can do so without
                                        actually being root.

                                        As for apt, yum and so on being the
                                        answer, the issue isn&#8217;t whether
                                        those tools provide a solution
                                        themselves, but whether they provide
                                        guidance on how solutions may be
                                        reached. It doesn&#8217;t surprise me
                                        that the Ruby community is experiencing
                                        the same kind of friction that the
                                        Python packaging community experienced
                                        with the Debian maintainers. After all,
                                        &#8220;opinionated&#8221; software
                                        development (ignoring the lessons of the
                                        past) was made popular by certain parts
                                        of the Ruby scene.

                                        can we make PYTHONPATH work the way its
                                        documented to work in Python ? This
                                        would make me very happy. I.e. any paths
                                        on PYTHONPATH are used first for
                                        locating packages, regardless of the
                                        difference between path/eggs on the
                                        systemwide path. It means it would work
                                        the same as CLASSPATH in java, PERL5LIB
                                        in perl, and PYTHONPATH
                                        in&#8230;.non-setuptools Python. I find
                                        setuptools&#8217; decision in this
                                        regard pretty arbitrary (PJE of course
                                        disagrees).

                                        As a Plone and Zope packager for RHEL
                                        myself, one that has worked hard to
                                        understand your distribution practices
                                        and built packages that work just fine
                                        despite Zopists and Plonists actually
                                        working to make that job
                                        <em>hard</em> for us, I am saddened to
                                        see that your ignorance of packaging
                                        systems for distributions make you say
                                        that.
                                    </p>

                                        Sentences like &#8220;Linux system
                                        package managers are absolutely not that
                                        tool; frankly it is absurd to even
                                        consider them as an alternative.&#8221;
                                        not only reveal the depth of your
                                        ignorance regarding (or your
                                        unwillingness to learn about) the
                                        capabilities of deployed package
                                        managers, they actually are an insult
                                        and a spitball to the face to the
                                        efforts of many people out there, an
                                        effort that has yielded systems like
                                        dpkg and RPM that are consistently
                                        superior and offer more functionality
                                        than these half-assed
                                        &#8220;solutions&#8221; in the vein of
                                        setuptools.

                                        opinion as &#8220;fact&#8221;, would you

                                        your latest releases for the operating
                                        systems out there?

                                    <p>
                                        There&#8217;s just no reason to package
                                        libraries for an OS. Applications should
                                        be packaged, that&#8217;s what people
                                        actually want to install. Why would any
                                        user want to install Paste, or Pylons,
                                        or WebOb, etc? I would entirely support
                                        the packaging of applications in
                                        sensible ways. That shouldn&#8217;t
                                        include packaging the libraries as
                                        separate entities. I know the reasons
                                        that are stated for packaging libraries
                                        &#8212; mostly security updates &#8212;
                                        but I find that to be a poor excuse for
                                        a lack of proper tools on the part of
                                        the packagers.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        For actual development, package managers
                                        just don&#8217;t make any sense at all.
                                        I just can&#8217;t fathom how the
                                        workflow would go. For a small number of
                                        libraries that are very stable and
                                        somewhat hard to install (e.g., PIL or
                                        MySQLdb) it can be useful.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        But OK, if you really think package
                                        managers make sense for developers,
                                        please show how you would reproduce this
                                        workflow:
                                    </p>

                                    <pre><code>$ virtualenv mysite
$ cd mysite
$ svn co http//mycompany.com/svn/configs/mysite etc/
$ pip -E . install -r etc/requirements.txt
$ ./bin/paster serve etc/development.ini
</code></pre>

                                    <p>
                                        <code>etc/requirements.txt</code>
                                        specifies a set of libraries to be
                                        installed, including libraries that will
                                        be checked out from source control and
                                        should be editable in-place.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        This does not use root. This does not
                                        affect anything else on the system,
                                        everything is encapsulated in
                                        <code>mysite/</code>. This installs
                                        libraries that are available on PyPI,
                                        source code directly available in
                                        repositories, or private repositories.
                                        It uses conventions already in place for
                                        Python code, I don&#8217;t have to
                                        convince anyone to change their packages
                                        to make this work (that wasn&#8217;t
                                        always the case, but it is now). I can
                                        easily repeat this process in another
                                        directory to do work on a branch.
                                        Library versions do not have to match up
                                        across directories.
                                    </p>

                                        I&#8217;ll give you a pass on one
                                        feature that my suggested workflow has:
                                        it works on rpm, deb, Gentoo, and Mac
                                        systems consistently, and it&#8217;s
                                        quite typical to have coworkers who use
                                        a diversity of those systems. Though if
                                        your workflow actually works like mine,
                                        you should be able to install rpm and
                                        repeat the workflow on any of those
                                        platforms (rpm after all installs on any
                                        of those, it just isn&#8217;t the
                                        primary packaging system).
                                    </p>

                                        Your argument that packaging libraries
                                        should not be done is absurd &#8212;
                                        tell that to the GTK+ or Qt guys then
                                        try to avoid the shitstorm that would
                                        ensue. There are many reasons to package
                                        libraries for an OS. One of them is
                                        that, if your users want to install an
                                        application that depends on your library
                                        (or even a particular version of it),
                                        then the users can use their package
                                        managers to install them in one shell
                                        line or a couple of clicks. Packaging
                                        libraries is

                                        is no excuse besides ignorance and
                                        laziness.

                                            For actual development, package
                                            managers just don’t make any sense
                                            at all. I just can’t fathom how the
                                            workflow would go. For a small
                                            number of libraries that are very
                                            stable and somewhat hard to install
                                            (e.g., PIL or MySQLdb) it can be
                                            useful.

                                        Developers are a minority. You can
                                        develop all you want using your
                                        &#8220;package managers&#8221;, but
                                        development is just one step, and
                                        distribution is another. No one is
                                        arguing that packaging here is good for
                                        the <em>developers</em> &#8212; it is
                                        good for <em>the users</em> who then can
                                        install your libraries and applications
                                        with zero effort. The users in this
                                        context are simply those who want to use
                                        the applications that require the
                                        libraries. And the workflow is, again,
                                        stupidly simple: python setup.py
                                        bdist_rpm, problem solved. Debian is
                                        kind of out of luck there, but that does
                                        not mean that you should also exclude
                                        RPM distros from the loop.

                                        specifying the dependencies on the
                                        setup.cfg file, instead of building this
                                        gigantic infrastructure that basically
                                        duplicates a Yum repository, your
                                        workflow would be braindead easy to
                                        install.

                                        Now, your workflow seems to have
                                        confused application code and data with
                                        an instance of your application. Shared
                                        code and shared data &#8212; to be run
                                        in a production setting &#8212; should
                                        be installed in the appropriate
                                        directories. Your workflow just
                                        mishmashes shared code, shared data, and
                                        instance data in a single directory.
                                        This is a crass violation of elementary
                                        system administration principles.
                                        I&#8217;m fine with you wanting to do
                                        that, but I (as an end user and a system
                                        administrator) retch when I see that,
                                        because it makes my job
                                        <em>so much harder</em>.

                                        Yes, it does not use root &#8212; but
                                        that is not a concern if you are the

                                        then well-written libraries should not

                                        no one has bothered to make a

                                        OS-managed /usr directories. Yes, you do

                                        their packages to make this work, but as

                                        setup.cfg&#8217;s now. Yes, you can
                                        easily repeat this process, but sadly
                                        this process just won&#8217;t integrate
                                        into the Install/Remove Software that
                                        every modern distribution has. Yes,
                                        library versions do not have to match up
                                        across directories, but this is not a

                                            diversity of those systems. Though
                                            if your workflow actually works like
                                            mine, you should be able to install
                                            rpm and repeat the workflow on any
                                            of those platforms (rpm after all

                                            your workflow makes it impossible to
                                            audit the installed base without
                                            additional effort
                                        </li>

                                            your workflow is only good for
                                            developers familiar with the
                                            console, not users who rightfully
                                            want to stay away from it
                                        </li>

                                        In short: get with the program already,
                                        what I&#8217;m asking is not a huge
                                        effort nor does it require you to
                                        abandon your preferred workflow either.

                                        Your workflow requires me to type five
                                        different commands after creating some
                                        files. To you, of course, this is
                                        probably something you know by rote now,
                                        but to me, understanding it is likely to
                                        take me several hours of reading and
                                        research &#8212; that I don&#8217;t even
                                        have to do in principle, because I just
                                        want to <em>use</em> the software, not
                                        develop it further.
                                    </p>

                                        This is why, for users, your workflow
                                        simply cannot &#8212; and will never
                                        &#8212; compete with:
                                    </p>

                                    <pre><code>yum install plone

                                    <p>
                                        or clicking Add/Remove Software on the
                                        menu, and checking the Plone checkmark,
                                        then Apply.

                                        I am admittedly biased to the workflow
                                        of web developers. Though I also
                                        explicitly said that real applications
                                        work just fine as packages, and
                                        that&#8217;s cool. I actually have lots
                                        of ideas that I think would be useful
                                        about assisting in the packaging of
                                        applications, though they don&#8217;t
                                        necessarily jive with Linux package
                                        management standards.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        For web developers the workflow I
                                        presented is a reasonable workflow, both
                                        for development and production, and the
                                        one you suggest is not reasonable. If
                                        you don&#8217;t understand this,
                                        I&#8217;m afraid you don&#8217;t
                                        understand web development. I&#8217;m
                                        not really sure how to bridge this
                                        divide.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        There&#8217;s no &#8220;user&#8221; for
                                        web applications. There are
                                        &#8220;sysadmins&#8221;,
                                        &#8220;developers&#8221; and somewhere
                                        in between &#8220;integrators&#8221;.
                                        There is also no
                                        &#8220;application&#8221; like you
                                        suggest. There are &#8220;sites&#8221;
                                        and &#8220;development
                                        environments&#8221; and
                                        &#8220;production environments&#8221;.
                                        None of these map to what Linux packages
                                        think of as an application. They also
                                        don&#8217;t map one-to-one to machines.

                                            Sentences like “Linux system package

                                        Here you imply that I just don&#8217;t
                                        know the tools. So I presented a real
                                        set of constraints in web development
                                        that apply to both development and
                                        production deployment, giving you an
                                        opportunity to educate me in how to use
                                        the tools; I figured there was a real
                                        possibility that the tools had features
                                        I wasn&#8217;t aware of. But instead of
                                        educating me on the tools, you told me
                                        my constraints were wrong. I&#8217;m
                                        afraid that was the answer I was
                                        expecting, because that&#8217;s the
                                        answer all the Linux package people seem
                                        to give. This is a big part of why
                                        there&#8217;s no progress: you
                                        won&#8217;t listen to us, instead you
                                        just reject our use cases.

                                        shot at educating me (and other readers)
                                        about how to use packaging tools like
                                        this, I&#8217;ll have to read this as a
                                        concession that in fact they
                                        aren&#8217;t capable of handling my
                                        (very typical!) use case.

                                        I think the biggest issue at hand here
                                        is that you both fail to see each
                                        others&#8217; argument. Both of you, I
                                        think, are exactly correct while
                                        managing to be more or less wrong. Or at
                                        least, not willing to accept the
                                        constraints offered.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        The weird thing is that both the
                                        developer and packager have exactly the
                                        same set of requirements:
                                        &#8220;Reproduce this environment for me
                                        so that applications Just Plain Work
                                        (TM)&#8221;.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        To address the packager, I&#8217;d think
                                        something like pip+virtualenv would be a
                                        godsend. Just make things as easy as
                                        &#8220;Correct version of Python? Check.

                                        What&#8217;s the trade off? You waste a
                                        bit of disk space and modules using C
                                        code aren&#8217;t handled yet. Solution?

                                    <p>
                                        To address the dev people, we need to
                                        handle both the active development of a
                                        project along with things like deploying
                                        to elastic compute clouds. Requirements
                                        change during a project and can&#8217;t
                                        be predicted. Allowing for scripted
                                        installation of entire environments is
                                        necessary in big production systems.
                                        Perhaps they appear to be goals at odds
                                        with each other, but I&#8217;d argue
                                        that putting a package into a package
                                        manager and into cloud production have
                                        the same requirements. Basically the
                                        ability to checkpoint the app and say
                                        &#8220;I knight thee, Version
                                        Pink&#8221;. After dealing with the
                                        ensuing argument about why that version
                                        has to be Pink and that it want&#8217;s
                                        to trade with Brown, the same rules
                                        apply. Make It Fucking Work. (TM).

                                        That&#8217;s pretty much my argument. So
                                        this is my conclusion.

                                    <p>
                                        I&#8217;ll throw another example out
                                        there, and a very big one. Say my
                                        application is build on TurboGears 1.0,
                                        which uses CherryPy 2.x, and is totally
                                        broken with Cherrpy 3.0 because CP3
                                        totally broke itself (for a good
                                        reason). So how will the package manager
                                        solve that case? As Ian pointed out the
                                        &#8220;latest&#8221; version isn&#8217;t
                                        the correct solution that is why we as
                                        developers had to build workarounds
                                        against it, the best example is
                                        virtualenv, yes it&#8217;s a nightmare
                                        for a sysadmin. But it will ensure me
                                        that MY application will work, instead
                                        of getting broken because someone though
                                        that upgrading to the latest version was
                                        a good idea. Following that line, if
                                        upgrading is such a good idea why
                                        aren&#8217;t all the package managers at
                                        python 3.0 right now? after all it is
                                        &#8220;library code&#8221; and if your
                                        application is coded right it should
                                        work. Also I really dislike the argument
                                        that developers are a minority, of
                                        course we are but why we the producers
                                        of the application suffer?

                                        As for the gnome/kde/any big system. I
                                        have to say that I have not contributed
                                        to several applications hosted on their
                                        environment specially because of the
                                        fact that I can&#8217;t run a
                                        development version and the stable at
                                        the same time. The closest example I
                                        have is Hamster which is a very nice
                                        time tracker for gtk. But since
                                        I&#8217;m a freelancer my income depends
                                        on running the stable version and not
                                        killing my database, but since it works
                                        with &#8220;linux package manager&#8221;
                                        there is simply no way for me to run
                                        both and I can&#8217;t afford to risk
                                        running from svn.

                                        I could go on, but the problem is
                                        imminent one version is only good for
                                        end users, this doesn&#8217;t applies to
                                        development and is horrible at web
                                        development. Just take a look at how
                                        most php libraries are installed in real
                                        production server.

                                        Rudd-O, yum install plone is easy, but
                                        usually completely useless. I
                                        haven&#8217;t seen anybody who actually
                                        runs a packaged Zope and Plone on a
                                        production system. One deal breaker is
                                        that it gets installed only once and
                                        only in one specific way. If you want to
                                        install it differently, for example with
                                        several clients in a ZEO setup, you
                                        can&#8217;t use it. If you want more
                                        than one server, you can&#8217;t use it.
                                        (Or well, you can, but you then have two
                                        different setups that are setup and
                                        configured in different ways, which is
                                        double the work).

                                    <p>
                                        Not to mention the many questions on
                                        Zope and Plone mailing lists we get when
                                        people have troubles with these setups.
                                        It would probably be a good idea not to
                                        package Zope or Plone in this way at
                                        all.

                                        This should be some examples of why
                                        Linux packaging isn&#8217;t always
                                        perfect, even for applications. It works
                                        for som cases and there it works great,
                                        but it does not work for everything. The
                                        other main example is developers, which
                                        you just brush off by claiming they are
                                        irrelevant. Maybe they are to Linux
                                        packagers. But in the Python community,
                                        they aren&#8217;t.

                                    <p>
                                        The last three posts (#20, #21, #22)
                                        nail it for me. I use Ubuntu, and
                                        &#8220;apt-get install plone&#8221; does
                                        not solve my problem. It seems that the
                                        people that do the packaging do a fine
                                        job at putting together a consistent
                                        ball of stuff that can be installed and
                                        works &#8211; in the sense that it shows
                                        up in your web browser &#8211; but
                                        it&#8217;s mostly unusable. In the end I
                                        prefer to install from source,
                                        that&#8217;s what I did recently for a
                                        lot of stuff (Twiki, Plone, etc.).
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        But it&#8217;s to easy to put the blame
                                        in the packagers. I think that the
                                        problem is much deeper and lies in the
                                        way the developers work. (and yes, I
                                        <em>am</em> a part-time developer
                                        myself, so I take some of the blame).
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        Most web applications (or web
                                        frameworks, as you wish) around are very
                                        far from being a &#8220;packaged
                                        product&#8221;. They tend to miss basic
                                        administrative functions that would be
                                        necessary to make them easily
                                        customizable. A programmer, or web
                                        developer, can work around it by using
                                        the few available line tools (if any),
                                        moving files by hand, changing
                                        permissions, and editing configuration
                                        files. BTW, having an
                                        <em>incomplete</em> command line
                                        interface (that does not expose all
                                        functionality and requires more direct
                                        fine tuning fiddling) is sometimes worse
                                        than having none. But I digress.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        That&#8217;s fine if you are a
                                        developer. But most users are not
                                        developers. That&#8217;s something that
                                        the packagers get right.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        Now there&#8217;s a question, does it
                                        make sense for the developer to think
                                        about end users? First of all, decide
                                        who are your real &#8220;users&#8221;.
                                        If you write code to be used by
                                        developers, then packaging may not make
                                        much sense. Just tell people how to grab
                                        your source tree, via tgz or Subversion.
                                        But notice that the barrier to entry is
                                        very high. And there&#8217;s lot of
                                        manual work to be done everytime someone
                                        starts a new project. Developers tend to
                                        brush it off, specially for their own
                                        frameworks, because they &#8220;just
                                        know&#8221; what they need to do, and
                                        assume that it&#8217;s too easy for
                                        everyone else. But again, I digress.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        At this point, when a developer takes
                                        one such application and
                                        &#8220;packages&#8221; it, he&#8217;s
                                        doing a nonservice &#8211; because the
                                        result is not usable by a end users and
                                        also not usable by a developer. Implicit
                                        in the packaging process there are
                                        dozens of decisions (where to put stuff,
                                        defaults, etc.). The decisions made by
                                        the packager get kind of &#8220;hard
                                        coded&#8221; in the package (how much
                                        depends on the way the packaging is
                                        done) and make the framework too rigid
                                        and difficult to customize for both
                                        groups.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        Now, if the developer <em>want</em> his
                                        application to be usable by end users,
                                        then thinking about the entire
                                        installation process makes sense. And
                                        also, it makes sense to provide a
                                        complete set of administration tools. It
                                        can be command line, but it would be
                                        better if it was web based. Think of it
                                        as a &#8220;bootstrapper&#8221; for the
                                        entire installation. The developer must
                                        write it in such a way that he can
                                        easily start a new project, just by
                                        installing a new package. He has to
                                        think as a packager, and also as a
                                        end-user. If done properly, the
                                        developer can make his own life much
                                        easier (by automating some of his own
                                        tasks). I believe this idea has very
                                        long legs and could lead to a very long
                                        and productive discussion.

                                        I think your separation between
                                        apckagers and developers are incorrect.
                                        I am a packager. I make loads of
                                        packages. Currently I am a co-manager of
                                        19 different packages on pypi. And most
                                        of these are dead easy to use in Plone,
                                        you just add a line or two to your
                                        buildout and rerun it. This is of course
                                        how packaging <em>should</em> be done.
                                        The release manager makes the release by
                                        running the script that builds tha
                                        packages.
                                    </p>

                                        The thing is that the Linux packaging
                                        tools doesn&#8217;t provide many of the
                                        functionalities that web frameworks and
                                        developers need. Ian has listed them
                                        above. That, together with the fact that
                                        the Linux packaging tools aren&#8217;t
                                        cross-platform, is why Python has
                                        developed it&#8217;s own system. Or
                                        well, a bunch of them in fact. :)

                                        Ian: your example in comment #16 (or the
                                        equivalent with zc.buildout)
                                        doesn&#8217;t &#8220;just work&#8221;
                                        when one (or more) of the libraries in
                                        your environment has C extension
                                        modules. Then you need to go back to
                                        your OS packaging tool and install the C
                                        compiler, and the header files for all
                                        the needed C libraries, manually.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        Other than that, yes, it is very
                                        convenient for the developer to install
                                        an isolated environment with all the
                                        needed libraries is very useful, and
                                        being a developer myself I appreciate
                                        it. It&#8217;s also seductively
                                        convenient for deployment, although it
                                        places a rather large burden on the
                                        sysadmin to manually keep watch for
                                        security issues in hundreds of little
                                        libraries scattered in several isolated
                                        environments, and to backport the fix to
                                        all the different versions that are
                                        being used.

                                        Jorge: the solution for the distribution
                                        packager is to
                                        <em
                                            >correctly specify the

                                        so that incompatible packages are not
                                        installed. Of course, PyPI already
                                        provides for that, so there is no reason
                                        why those dependencies can&#8217;t map
                                        1:1 to distribution dependencies, so I
                                        don&#8217;t know what your argument is.

                                        And the argument that &#8220;no one does
                                        that, so I couldn&#8217;t possibly

                                        an argument at all. Just because people
                                        don&#8217;t do it, does not mean it is a
                                        bad idea.

                                        Carlos: just because apt-get install
                                        plone does not cover
                                        <em>your</em> scenario, does not follow
                                        that it is not a desirable one. Plone is
                                        a set of libraries and a series of
                                        management commands. There is no reason
                                        why packagers can&#8217;t package them
                                        in a reusable, effective manner, just as
                                        I have done for RHEL. Keep in mind that
                                        my Plone packages have full support for
                                        eggs, so if you want to use them in your
                                        instance, my packages certainly do not
                                        impede you.

                                        Lennart: the Python packaging system is
                                        very convenient, but it creates system
                                        management nightmares.

                                        demonstrated your one-track mind
                                        regarding the packaging issue, and you
                                        simply don&#8217;t <em>want</em> to
                                        think about anybody else who might
                                        actually have valid concerns &#8212;
                                        despite the fact that you all could have
                                        solved these concerns for distributors
                                        merely by providing a setup.cfg manifest
                                        with the correct dependencies for your
                                        eggs.

                                        For those of you who would rather
                                        collaborate in making your packages
                                        widely available in distributions,
                                        contact me at rudd-o dot com and I will
                                        personally help you get your packages
                                        prepared for RPM distribution and even
                                        collect them on my own RPM repository.

                                        Well, I guess I get the last word since
                                        Rudd-O is giving up on the argument.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        For the record, I and many of the people
                                        who have responded to Rudd-O have
                                        regularly done system administration. I
                                        happily use package managers for many
                                        tasks. But I don&#8217;t use package
                                        managers for web development, and I
                                        wouldn&#8217;t advocate anyone else use
                                        them either.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        Web development, or integration of web
                                        tools, should be done in an environment
                                        where there is no barrier to the
                                        deployment of multiple versions of
                                        software. When you do your first
                                        deployment a single version will work
                                        fine, but this falls apart later when
                                        you want to support working
                                        installations that don&#8217;t need to
                                        be updated, alongside new software that
                                        is built with different library
                                        versions. Because the problems with
                                        using a Linux package don&#8217;t appear
                                        immediately, I think it is good to
                                        actually discourage their use so as to
                                        avoid future frustration for users.
                                        I&#8217;m not saying that current
                                        (language-specific) tools are great, but
                                        they have a reasonable workflow for
                                        deploying web applications, while a
                                        packaging system that requires
                                        system-wide consistency is not
                                        reasonable. All this is motivated by
                                        sysadmin concerns, not even developer
                                        concerns.
                                    </p>

                                        Though I will also add: if you are a
                                        professional, and unless you work with
                                        absolutely zero programmers (even anyone
                                        who might occasionally touch some code),
                                        you must also have a development process
                                        that matches up with your deployment
                                        process. Developers need to be able to
                                        create local working installations, and
                                        they must be able to edit those
                                        installations and share that work with
                                        others. Installed Linux packages
                                        don&#8217;t work that way. This
                                        isn&#8217;t just a problem for web

                                        it is a bad idea. If it works for you,
                                        great. For most Plone users, it
                                        doesn&#8217;t, for reasons mentioned

                                        ian: I&#8217;m very happy to see
                                        you&#8217;ve hit the nail on the head
                                        with this:
                                    </p>

                                    <pre><code>There’s also a lot of conflicts between Setuptools and package
maintainers. This is kind of a proxy war between developers and sysadmins,
who have very different motivations.[1]_
</code></pre>

                                    <p>
                                        If everyone would keep in mind that
                                        there&#8217;s more than one audience for
                                        different stages in an app&#8217;s
                                        lifetime, then I think even Rudd-O and
                                        you could at least see how your views
                                        interlock.

                                        .. _[1]: Note that instead of seeing
                                        this as a war by proxy, I look at it as
                                        a contract negotiation with a mediator.
                                        The two parties involved are system
                                        administrators and developers. The poor
                                        packagers are the mediator that has to
                                        carry requirements and messages from one
                                        side to the other.

                                    <h2>The Developer</h2>

                                    <pre><code>$ virtualenv mysite
$ cd mysite
$ svn co http//mycompany.com/svn/configs/mysite etc/
$ pip -E . install -r etc/requirements.txt

                                    <p>
                                        There&#8217;s many many ways to make
                                        this work using packaging tools.
                                        However, the appropriate methods for the
                                        different audiences are not the same. If
                                        the audience is the developer who has
                                        just installed a new workstation and
                                        needs to start working on the next
                                        generation of the website using
                                        virtualenv is the correct thing to do.
                                        However, what it&#8217;s doing is
                                        creating a customized environment for
                                        running a particular environment. This
                                        is anathema to making a system
                                        administrators job easy.
                                    </p>

                                        After the developer has gotten the
                                        application to a certain level of
                                        functionality some engineer has to start
                                        making sure it runs the platforms the
                                        company cares to support (either
                                        internally or externally). They can
                                        create a local install in a directory
                                        using the platform&#8217;s package
                                        repositories and checkin changes to the
                                        application code to support that
                                        platform. In open source, the Developer
                                        and Packager often share the Deployment
                                        Engineer role.

                                        The packager may be part of mycompany or
                                        a Linux distribution but they are
                                        building the software specifically for a
                                        distribution and therefore care about
                                        the conventions that a distribution uses
                                        to make their users&#8217; (system
                                        administrators) lives easier.

                                    <h2>The System Administrator</h2>

                                    <pre><code># yum install mysite

                                        The ideal for the system administrator
                                        is to run a single command that
                                        downloads and installs the application
                                        and all its dependencies. By having the
                                        application inside a distro package they
                                        also have the ability to do these
                                        things:
                                    </p>

                                    <pre><code>Check what hotfixes were applied:
# rpm -V mysite mydependency
Check the version:
# rpm -q mysite mydependency

# yum update

# yum install mysite

                                    <h2>Notes</h2>

                                    <p>
                                        Not all applications have all audiences
                                        explicitly. There&#8217;s many web
                                        applications that are not meant to be
                                        distributed, for instance. However, even
                                        in a one-company-only application,
                                        it&#8217;s important to remember that
                                        the system administrator audience exists
                                        even if it is the same person as the
                                        developer. If your web site becomes
                                        popular, you may need to start load
                                        balancing it. Your current server may go
                                        belly up. The operating system
                                        you&#8217;re using may reach its end of
                                        life and you have to port to a new
                                        version. You may leave the company or
                                        your company may grow and hire a system
                                        admin.

                                        explicit Conflict so that CherryPy3 and

                                        In Fedora we&#8217;ve made use of the
                                        multiple version functionality of
                                        setuptools (and run up against
                                        limitations in its design) so that you
                                        can have both versions of CherryPy
                                        installed at the same time.

                                        Note that for a distribution POV,
                                        we&#8217;d love to have a versioning
                                        scheme that works flawlessly. Debian,
                                        where the idea of doing compatible
                                        python modules was rejected, versions
                                        each of their C library packages so you
                                        can have separate versions. Fedora,
                                        which doesn&#8217;t like to do them for
                                        maintainability reasons (what do we do
                                        when a security issue arises in
                                        CherryPy2 and the devs say, &#8220;CP2
                                        is no longer supported, we&#8217;re only
                                        releasing a security fix for
                                        CherryPy3&#8243;?), will do compat
                                        packages like the CherryPy2 package when
                                        the value for keeping the apps outweighs
                                        the maintainance costs. ATM, only
                                        strategies like psycopg use (changing
                                        the module name from psycopg to psycopg2
                                        on a major, API changing update) work
                                        100%. The setuptools method has promise,
                                        though&#8230; if only it would mature a

should be it's developer. Not several people over several OS's monkeypatching it to work on their OS, because it's important yet the original author is
gone. Now this particular problem is not related to packager it's related to developers, if TG1 refuses to die. Even after CP people say no more fixes for
CP2, then it's their responsibility to maintain CP2.

                                    <p>
                                        I should say that I think packaging Trac
                                        (ideally with a package that includes
                                        nearly all its dependencies) seems quite
                                        reasonable. That is an
                                        &#8220;application&#8221; in a way that
                                        makes sense. Though even then it is
                                        difficult, as shown by Plone &#8212; but
                                        because Plone involves lots of
                                        plugins/products (and while Plone moves
                                        along at a reasonably slow place, the
                                        plugins do not), packaging just
                                        doesn&#8217;t keep up, and people end up
                                        reverting to methods better supported by
                                        upstream developers. It
                                        <em>could</em> work, but I think it
                                        doesn&#8217;t work because there&#8217;s
                                        intermediaries. Only if Plone itself had
                                        the infrastructure set up to create and
                                        distribute its own RPM or deb packages
                                        (and packages for any plugin anyone
                                        wants to make available) would it be a
                                        working system. And though Trac is more
                                        interesting in its base state than
                                        Plone, it will suffer the same problems.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        There&#8217;s no reason Trac or any
                                        other application needs to depend on
                                        separately packaged Python libraries,
                                        and I do think that&#8217;s specifically
                                        problematic. But if
                                        <code>yum install mysite</code>
                                        doesn&#8217;t involve any dependencies
                                        (except for very conservative packages)
                                        then that could work pretty well.
                                        I&#8217;d still be pretty worried about
                                        migrations, though&#8230; but arguably
                                        developers should work harder at making
                                        data migration work with less
                                        interaction. Having specific support for
                                        data migration (mostly meaning clear
                                        policies for how backup and migration
                                        and reverts should work) would also be
                                        an improvement for people creating
                                        packages.

                                        Of course it&#8217;s also common for web
                                        developers to have two versions of the
                                        exact same application simultaneously
                                        deployed on a single box. I find the way
                                        Linux package managers deal with
                                        versions to simply be&#8230; dumb. As in
                                        not-technically-advanced-in-a-way-that-actively-hurts.
                                        There&#8217;s also problems about the
                                        development build process being very
                                        different from the deployment process,
                                        which leads to bugs in one or the other.
                                        These bugs cause a lot of social
                                        problems, as they aggravate the already
                                        difficult relationship between sysadmin
                                        and developer (a relationship that can
                                        be difficult even when they are the same
                                        person ;).

                                        What we need is a great language
                                        <em>and</em> platform independent
                                        package manager that can work throughout
                                        the development and deployment
                                        lifecycle. I know of no such thing at
                                        the moment. (I thought [rpath](<a
                                            href="http://www.rpath.com/corp/"

                                        >) might be like that, but from what I
                                        can tell it is not.)

                                                for security issues in hundreds
                                                of little libraries scattered in
                                                several isolated environments,
                                                and to backport the fix to all
                                                the different versions that are
                                                being used.&#8221;

                                        This as an admission that the packaging
                                        tools are NOT adequate for developer
                                        needs. Why does having isolated
                                        environments preclude simple
                                        administration? If the package
                                        management tools were in charge of
                                        managing environments, then they would
                                        know where to check for installed
                                        package versions, even if I had hundreds
                                        scattered about my home directory.

                                    <p>
                                        The worldviews are very different
                                        indeed. It&#8217;s a complex problem
                                        that has many roots.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        1) Distributions are an attempt to
                                        freeze the world in a one entirely self
                                        consistent image. Packager&#8217;s
                                        priorities are completeness (no broken
                                        dependencies), self consistency, and
                                        stability. That&#8217;s why they prefer
                                        to package the latest stable version.
                                        But many times, the stable version of
                                        one particular program depends on the
                                        unstable version of a library
                                        (that&#8217;s only the first problem).
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        2) Packagers are also concerned about
                                        space, due to disk and bandwidth
                                        concerns. That means eliminating
                                        redundancy. Most packagers hate the idea
                                        of having multiple versions of a single
                                        library &#8220;just because&#8221; one
                                        app needs it.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        3) Last but not least, packagers are
                                        concerned about security. Again, having
                                        multiple versions of a library tends to
                                        make their work harder due to the
                                        potential combinations and security
                                        threats.

                                        That&#8217;s not a problem for
                                        conventional applications, because most
                                        applications evolve slowly, and even
                                        when that&#8217;s not the case, most
                                        users do not need the latest upgrades
                                        &#8211; unless there&#8217;s a security
                                        issue, which are addressed by minimal
                                        patches that only fix the problem and do
                                        not add any functionality (so
                                        dependencies keep relatively unchanged).

                                                stable (and that leads to
                                                problem #1 mentioned above).

                                                than the one recommended to run
                                                the final application.

                                        To make things more confusing, the world
                                        is not black and white. There&#8217;s a
                                        middle ground between the two. Trac, for
                                        instance &#8211; most of the times I can
                                        work with a older version, so I
                                        don&#8217;t mind installing the packaged
                                        one. And it will work out of the box for
                                        most users. But for other packages,
                                        it&#8217;s much harder to come up with a
                                        sensible installation out of a generic
                                        package.

                                        One of my particular gripes is with
                                        documentation. Take some package (for
                                        example, Twiki or Plone). Install it and
                                        try to customize it, following the
                                        instructions on the original website.
                                        Most of the times*, there are no
                                        instructions on how to install the
                                        &#8220;packaged version&#8221;, and some
                                        of the instructions that apply to the
                                        &#8220;tgz version&#8221; do not make
                                        sense or are not applicable to the
                                        packaged one. Locations differ, some of
                                        the parameters are already customized,
                                        and that just makes life more difficult
                                        for the users.

                                        This is why Gentoo portage comes with a
                                        deployment tool called webapp-config.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        Let&#8217;s say you install trac using
                                        portage with
                                        <code>emerge =trac-0.11.2</code>, the
                                        files will just be placed into
                                        <code
                                            >/usr/share/webapps/trac/0.11.2/</code
                                        >. You will then use webapp-config to
                                        deploy it to the desired web server(s)
                                        or vhost(s).
                                    </p>

                                        It is far from perfect (e.g.
                                        doesn&#8217;t support virtualenv,
                                        doesn&#8217;t support nginx), but at
                                        least it partially solves the problem
                                        where more than one copy and/or more
                                        than one version of a webapp are
                                        required to be running on the same
                                        machine.
                                    </p>

                                        Btw, it is also
                                        &#8220;backward-compatible&#8221; with
                                        other less capable packaging tools, such
                                        that you can configure it to auto-deploy
                                        to your localhost whenever you emerge a
                                        webapp package, if you only need just
                                        one copy and one version of that webapp.

                                        Anyway, to get anything done at work, we
                                        just use a combination of virtualenv,
                                        custom distcmds, and a local eggbasket.

                                        consumers. The consumers do not do any
                                        administration, that&#8217;s only the
                                        users who are often/mostly also the
                                        administrators of that
                                        server/host/machine. There one can much
                                        more easily get away with pulling up an
                                        alternative management system in
                                        parallel to the distribution&#8217;s own
                                        system without doing any major harm.

                                    <p>
                                        But with most other applications of
                                        Python it&#8217;s a bit different.
                                        Whenever you use Python for system
                                        administrative tools (Ubuntu has got
                                        quite a few already), for
                                        libraries/bindings to libraries, or for
                                        application level (excluding web
                                        applications) it&#8217;s all a different
                                        ball game. In all these cases the
                                        system&#8217;s package management
                                        becomes <em>much</em> more important
                                        than Python&#8217;s own attempts to
                                        cater for the developer and/or web admin
                                        needs.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        Boiling down to this: I can fully
                                        understand both sides. Unfortunately
                                        there&#8217;s quite some clash between
                                        them as described. The challenges ahead
                                        would be now to find a Good Solution
                                        (TM) that is well suitable to bridge the
                                        gap and cater for the non-web needs.
                                        Maybe even some sort of a PyPI mirror
                                        that offers eggs as pre-rolled .deb/.rpm
                                        packages for different distributions.

                                                Debian Python packaging
                                                toolchains reuse Distutils. As a
                                                Python developper, I want to
                                                write a setup.py; Debian wants a
                                                makefile. Well, the debian/rules
                                                makefile uses the setup.py
                                                script with appropriate
                                                command-line options.
                                                (Dependencies in the Python
                                                system would be a must though,
                                                for now they are in a
                                                Debian-specific file.) See, no
                                                conflict between the two
                                                systems.

                                                Integrating PyPI and APT isn’t
                                                just a technical issue: Debian
                                                packages are DFSG-free. (Of
                                                course, Debian means
                                                “main”-only.) I am totally in
                                                favor of decentralisation for
                                                VCS for instance, but I like the
                                                centralized control of the
                                                freeness of software allowed by
                                                using Debian archives.

                                                APT can work with local
                                                repositories (i.e. lines
                                                starting with “deb file:///” in
                                                the sources.list file). A local
                                                repository (or an HTTP one, for
                                                that matter) is really a bunch
                                                of deb packages and a few
                                                meta-files. Automation can be
                                                done with the help of
                                                mini-dinstall, pbuilder,
                                                dnotify, *-buildpackage. (After
                                                all, pip is “just” automation of
                                                such things ;)

                                        Well, I know my points only work if
                                        you’re already happily using a deb-based
                                        system. I don’t know whether and how
                                        Python developpers should compensate
                                        Windows flaws. And if you like setup.py
                                        develop, I don’t know how much coding
                                        would be required to automate these
                                        steps using a local APT repository, but
                                        that would be worth trying.

                                    <p>
                                        This is all very interesting. Last post
                                        was from february 2009. I would like to
                                        know if any progress was made in light
                                        of python 3. If i&#8217;m not mistaken,
                                        still only distutils is in the standard
                                        library. Another interesting idea would
                                        be to look at this in the era of
                                        virtualization. Web applications running
                                        in different versions on the same
                                        machine, is that still viable?
                                        Shouldn&#8217;t they at least be running
                                        on a different virtual host?
                                    </p>

                                        Standard library, yes. But much of the
                                        modules above is available for Python 3
                                        as well.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        It&#8217;s perfectly viable to run
                                        different versions of both Python and
                                        web applications on one machine. No
                                        problems at all, in fact, if you know
                                        what you are doing. I like virtual
                                        machines, but use them more to separate
                                        customers than web servers. :-)
