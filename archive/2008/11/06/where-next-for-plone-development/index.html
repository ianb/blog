                                    One of the ongoing concerns in the Plone
                                    community has been the difficulty of
                                    attracting and maintaining developer
                                    interest in the community, and generally
                                    making Plone easier to work with as a
                                    developer. It&#8217;s been a very successful
                                    community for consulting and integration
                                    work, but it has not been as rewarding for
                                    developers. There&#8217;s the idea of a
                                    &quot;Plone Tax&quot;, which means different
                                    things to different people but just
                                    generally speaks to the sense that Plone
                                    takes a little off the top &#8212; time to
                                    restart, time to run the tests, time to dig
                                    into code that just goes too deep. There are
                                    some distinct <em>problems</em> with Plone,
                                    but probably the biggest problem is the
                                    quantity of small challenges and the general
                                    size and complexity of the system.

                                    At the moment there is no clear path forward
                                    to resolve this. A previous effort to fix

                                    Zope 3 into Zope 2. Plone is intimately tied
                                    to Zope 2, and Five let them use new code
                                    without having to do abandon the old
                                    environment. But the result wasn&#8217;t
                                    terribly satisfying: Five didn&#8217;t
                                    <em>remove</em> any complexity, it only
                                    added to it. Even if the new components were
                                    superior that doesn&#8217;t make them
                                    <em>simple</em>. Plone is aching for more
                                    <em>simplicity</em>, not more power.

                                    reform itself as a codebase. Zope 2 is a
                                    behemoth, and its metaphors are deeply
                                    intertwined with existing code.

                                    I saw a general interest in two directions:
                                    one was to encourage non-content-management
                                    tasks to be implemented in a complementary
                                    (but separate) technology, another direction
                                    is continuing to refactor the existing
                                    codebase while somehow trying to maintain
                                    backward compatibility.

                                    It&#8217;s unclear how to refactor the
                                    existing codebase in such a way that it is
                                    any simpler, but I suppose these two
                                    directions are not exclusive. I want to
                                    focus on the idea of a complementary
                                    environment. There&#8217;s two products in
                                    particular that have been attracting
                                    interest:

                                    These two products usually go under the
                                    umbrella of &quot;exciting new ways to
                                    improve the developer experience in
                                    Plone&quot; which is a kind of generic
                                    positive sentiment. But to my mind they
                                    represent two significantly different paths
                                    forward, and the differences deserve some
                                    more critical thought.

                                    most ZCML (ZCML is Zope 3&#8242;s XML-based
                                    language for declaring the relation of
                                    various components in a system). Grok uses
                                    conventions and introspection to make Zope 3
                                    look more like a traditional web framework,
                                    with simple views and models and templates,
                                    and less of the wiring you have to set up in
                                    typical Zope 3 architectures. At the same
                                    time, you can add all the Zope 3
                                    declarations to break out of the automatic
                                    conventions. Grok is a more pleasant layer
                                    on top of Zope 3, but it&#8217;s entirely
                                    focused on Zope 3, and it is led by

                                    they&#8217;ve started work on a framework
                                    intended to be familiar to the Zope

                                    >. This framework uses some Zope 3 concepts,
                                    but it&#8217;s more built from scratch than
                                    it is built from Zope 3, and it is attached
                                    to Zope 2 only insofar as it uses the pieces
                                    they&#8217;ve extracted and the ideas
                                    they&#8217;ve become comfortable with.
                                    They&#8217;ve described it as the framework
                                    they want to use when someone asks them to
                                    build something in Zope 2.

                                    Grok and Repoze have a significantly
                                    different development methodology. One is a
                                    layer on Zope 3, the other is an extraction
                                    of ideas from Zope 2 (and a few from Zope
                                    3). In part I think the distinction
                                    hasn&#8217;t been presented very clearly
                                    because the Repoze and Grok communities
                                    overlap a great deal, and everyone is quite
                                    congenial with each other, and they are
                                    reluctant to enter debates about the
                                    designs. While I <em>also</em> consider them
                                    all colleagues, I also feel pretty strongly
                                    about the design differences and I feel a
                                    discussion contrasting them is important.

                                    advantages Grok has over plain Zope 3, which
                                    Grok can offer to Plone to manage its
                                    existing use of Zope 3 technologies.

                                    I think Plone shouldn&#8217;t be so focused
                                    on managing the complexity of its stack, but
                                    focus on reducing that complexity. And it
                                    should reduce that complexity by focusing on
                                    content management and moving all the other
                                    pieces people have built on Plone out of
                                    Plone. It can&#8217;t just leave people
                                    hanging, which is why developing a clear
                                    story for how those other pieces should be
                                    developed is essential. Plone
                                    <em>the community</em> doesn&#8217;t have to
                                    map one-to-one to Plone
                                    <em>the software</em>. Plone the software
                                    should become smaller and more focused.
                                    Plone the community doesn&#8217;t have to
                                    become more focused &#8212; the community
                                    does what it needs to do, what customers ask
                                    for, what is necessary to make a site
                                    compelling. To be clear on what I&#8217;m
                                    proposing here: Plone should have a
                                    community-recommended way to build non-Plone
                                    applications. This doesn&#8217;t mean you
                                    <em>have</em> to use those techniques, but
                                    it should be much more concrete than just
                                    &quot;there&#8217;s a bunch of cool things
                                    out there, and maybe you should look around
                                    and use one of those.&quot; By having a
                                    community-recommended pattern of development
                                    you can maintain and build on the Plone
                                    community, which is at least as important an
                                    asset as the Plone software.

                                    With this in mind I believe an extraction of
                                    Zope 2 and Plone ideas is the right path
                                    forward. Extraction is the process of
                                    <em>isolating</em> code and ideas, and
                                    <em>localizing</em> the effect of that code.
                                    These are some of the most important ways to
                                    actually increase the simplicity of a
                                    codebase. In the Zope 2 (and even 3)
                                    codebase the thing that brings the most
                                    complexity is the non-locality of code, that
                                    parts of the system can effect each other in
                                    complex and unexpected ways. Zope 3
                                    formalizes these patterns of non-locality:

                                    is largely about introducing non-localized
                                    relationships between code.

                                    Arguably this non-locality of effect is
                                    exactly what people want, it&#8217;s what
                                    enables pervasive customizations. When a
                                    client asks you to change some little piece
                                    deep in the system, you don&#8217;t really
                                    want to modify the system&#8217;s code
                                    &#8212; you want to add a little code to the
                                    outside of the system that effects the
                                    change you desire. The Component
                                    Architecture is a formalized way of making
                                    these kinds of changes, where Acquisition
                                    was a lower-level mechanism to do the same
                                    sort of thing. I remain a

                                    overused. Still I think clearly Plone needs
                                    flexibility that a purely bespoke
                                    application would not require. But
                                    there&#8217;s no way out of it: that
                                    flexibility has a high cost. In this there
                                    is no clear solution. In addition to
                                    Acquisition, the complexity of Zope 2
                                    security, the many layers of skinning&#8230;
                                    is the Component Architecture what Plone
                                    needs? From where I stand it seems like a
                                    step further in the wrong direction&#8230;
                                    and yes, it is a better placed step than any
                                    of the ones before, but if it&#8217;s still
                                    a step in the wrong direction does that
                                    matter?
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    I think Plone (at least the community) needs
                                    to be conservative in its enabling of these
                                    customizations. Sure, the customizability is
                                    &quot;powerful,&quot; but I don&#8217;t hear
                                    people clamoring for power. They want
                                    simple, predictable, fast, maintainable.
                                    That&#8217;s not necessarily the same as
                                    &quot;easy&quot; &#8212; I think sometimes
                                    it&#8217;s worth making things a little
                                    longer and less automatic to make a system
                                    more explicit and make code more localized.
                                    I think Repoze is a step in
                                    <em>this</em> direction, a big (maybe even
                                    an intimidatingly giant) step towards
                                    simplicity. That&#8217;s the step I think
                                    Plone should make.
                                </p>

                                    So, I offer this as my suggestion to Plone.
                                    I think Plone-the-community has the
                                    opportunity to be more than
                                    Plone-the-software; I think it
                                    <em>must</em> do this to remain viable in
                                    the long term. But to get there the
                                    community make some choices &#8212; you
                                    can&#8217;t add simplicity.

                                        Concerning Repoze &#8220;versus&#8221;
                                        Grok. Yes, there are differences: Repoze
                                        does a lot of rewriting in the interests
                                        of implementation simplicity. Grok
                                        hasn&#8217;t rewritten the
                                        implementation and focused on usage
                                        simplicity. The two systems are learning
                                        from each other: Repoze can use bits of
                                        Grok&#8217;s auto-configuration system.
                                        Meanwhile inspired by some of
                                        Repoze&#8217;s work (as well as
                                        frustrations with some of Zope 3&#8242;s
                                        non-locality), I&#8217;ve started
                                        looking at simplifying parts of the
                                        underlying Zope 3 system (and in general
                                        the sometimes complex structure of
                                        dependencies in the Zope 3 codebase is a
                                        thing Zope 3 developers are concerned
                                        about).
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        Grok&#8217;s busy
                                        <em>extracting</em> useful bits of code
                                        from itself and both Martian as well as
                                        grokcore.component are reusable in
                                        random Python projects. The rest of the
                                        grokcore.* stuff is reusable in Zope 2
                                        and in fact reuse in Zope 2 is driving
                                        this process.

                                    <p>
                                        You say the use of the component
                                        architecture is a step in the wrong
                                        direction, but could you be more
                                        explicit about why this would be so?
                                        What if you use it in moderation? Some
                                        form of customization machinery is
                                        needed and sticking to the
                                        (well-engineered, much used,
                                        battle-tested) devil we know seems like
                                        the right idea to me.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        It&#8217;s important for any scenario to
                                        move forward is to have a way to evolve
                                        from A to B. You can take risks in this
                                        evolution, and perhaps larger risks
                                        should be taken, but it still will have
                                        to be an evolutionary step.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        The word &#8220;simple&#8221; means
                                        different things to people. Simple in
                                        implementation? Simple in use? Simple to
                                        change? Assembly language is simple in
                                        implementation and Python adds huge
                                        amounts of abstraction and automation
                                        over a machine. Yet, Python&#8217;s a
                                        lot simpler in use than assembly
                                        language, even though assembly is so
                                        much simpler in implementation. So, of
                                        course automation and abstraction can be
                                        added to a system to make things
                                        simpler! That said, implementation
                                        simplicity can increase usage simplicity
                                        as a system can become easier to
                                        understand and predict, but it&#8217;s
                                        hardly clear-cut. Simplicity in
                                        implementation is valuable when it
                                        increases simplicity of development, and
                                        simplicity of use.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        So, I&#8217;ll grant there is value in
                                        simplicity in implementation. I also
                                        believe Plone&#8217;s implementation can
                                        be significantly simpler. It&#8217;ll
                                        still be complex no matter what, though,
                                        just <em>less</em> complex than it is
                                        now. Any move to simplify Plone will run
                                        the risk of trading off one form of
                                        complexity for another. There is also
                                        value in sticking to the complexity the
                                        community knows about.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        I believe Plone&#8217;s best road to
                                        simplification takes two paths:
                                    </p>

                                    <ul>
                                        <li>
                                            <p>
                                                Towards simplicity of
                                                implementation: removing some of
                                                the old ways of doing things
                                                permanently. Hopefully a point
                                                in evolution has been reached
                                                that old things can be removed.
                                                The removal of acquisition from
                                                the system would be a good,
                                                though big example. Allow
                                                content types that are truly
                                                simple and don&#8217;t rely on
                                                SimpleItem and a whole bunch of
                                                other things would be another
                                                good step.

                                                Towards simplicity of use:
                                                adding easier ways to do things
                                                that are too hard right now.
                                                Using Grok technology to help
                                                with the wiring of the
                                                inevitable configuration
                                                machinery is a good example.

                                        The alternative would be writing a new
                                        CMS taking into account the lessons
                                        learned from Plone. That&#8217;s an
                                        interesting project. Is it the Plone
                                        project?

                                        One other road to take if simplification
                                        of Plone is not that easy, is to
                                        simplify the use of Plone the software
                                        for other Python developers not willing
                                        to pay the Plone tax. Using
                                        ContentMirror, for example, it is
                                        possible to serialize Plone content into
                                        a relational database and create simple
                                        applications on top of that using any
                                        other framework.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        Granted, this is not an approach that
                                        can be used for all kinds of projects,
                                        but there are many use cases where
                                        separating the content production from
                                        its delivery would be a very good idea.
                                        Plone is a very good CMS, so I think it
                                        would be great if people not willing to
                                        use it as a framework can still benefit
                                        from it as a piece of software. That
                                        would make Plone, the community, even
                                        bigger.

                                        In part, this comes down to the old
                                        &#8220;application vs. platform&#8221;
                                        argument. I think that technologies like
                                        WSGI and Repoze are enabling Plone to be
                                        more of an application again, because,
                                        as you say, non-CMS functionality can be
                                        built elsewhere.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        I personally believe that Repoze and
                                        Grok are both key to Plone&#8217;s
                                        future. Roughly, I think the roadmap
                                        should look something like this:
                                    </p>

                                                Rip out things we no longer need
                                                (already happening on trunk).

                                                something, choose one way and
                                                remove all other ways (starting
                                                to happen on trunk).

                                                and focus on making these as
                                                easy and friendly for
                                                integrators as possible (this is
                                                where I think Grok conventions
                                                and patterns will be
                                                beneficial). This includes
                                                things like:

                                        I whole-heartedly agree with
                                        Martijn&#8217;s point about evolution.
                                        Developers have a strong tendency to
                                        favour a rewrite or a clean break, but
                                        that&#8217;s a sure way to lose those
                                        who&#8217;ve already invested in the
                                        platform. We&#8217;re only just now
                                        coming to the point where the feature
                                        set and the available tools and
                                        frameworks cover what I&#8217;d consider
                                        the basic CMS needs (with a few
                                        exceptions), and there&#8217;s a real
                                        drive in the community now to focus on
                                        simplification and the integrator
                                        experience.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        At the same time, we need to be very
                                        careful about throwing the baby out with
                                        the bathwater. The Zope 3 CA has an
                                        important part to play in making Plone a
                                        productive, usable and flexible system.
                                        People may not be clamoring for more
                                        power, because they <em>have</em> power
                                        now. We&#8217;d like to unify the way in
                                        which that power is provided (e.g. by
                                        removing some things that still rely on
                                        acquisition when it should rely on
                                        components), not take it away.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        We also need to be better at indicating
                                        what extension points and APIs are aimed
                                        at integrators/developers and what
                                        things are really just the concern of
                                        Plone&#8217;s core developers. Right
                                        now, &#8220;the API&#8221; is kind of
                                        the whole application, in that you can
                                        customise and change anywhere. We need
                                        to ring-fence that with something a bit
                                        more obvious that gets people started
                                        quickly, and only require them to get
                                        into that level of detail if they really
                                        need to.

                                        I think Plone should take a carrot
                                        approach to simplification, not the
                                        stick of removing or deprecating
                                        techniques. Right now every Plone site
                                        of any substantial size has non-CMS
                                        aspects to it. Removing things from
                                        Plone is politically difficult as a
                                        result. Getting people to implement
                                        those non-CMS things outside of Plone
                                        seems like the easier approach at the
                                        moment, the approach that is on most
                                        people&#8217;s timelines (even if the
                                        dates are different), and it
                                        doesn&#8217;t have to effect backward
                                        compatibility right now. But actually
                                        doing this isn&#8217;t easy, and
                                        probably requires some extra help from
                                        Plone as well. So I think it makes sense
                                        to figure out that story, to focus on
                                        that work for now, because it&#8217;s
                                        not a small amount of work and it
                                        won&#8217;t happen with out direct
                                        effort. If that&#8217;s successful then
                                        I think it&#8217;ll be much less
                                        disruptive if Plone itself is
                                        simplified.

                                        As Carlos suggests, I think
                                        ContentMirror could be part of that
                                        story. The more formally
                                        &#8220;correct&#8221; solution might be
                                        web services of some sort, but I think a
                                        relational database mirror is probably
                                        better understood and less likely to
                                        cause performance problems due to its
                                        implicitly async design.

                                    <p>
                                        In my experience with the use of
                                        components and component adaptation in
                                        Plone, there are two major problems.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        The first is, that adaptation is
                                        overused. A portlet is a five-way
                                        adapter and there&#8217;s no way to
                                        change the adaptation order. This rules
                                        out a swift solution for most of the
                                        more advanced use-cases, simply because
                                        you&#8217;d have to work very hard with
                                        the system to get the adaptation pattern
                                        you really want. Adaptation as we know
                                        it is simply not a very good
                                        multiplexer.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        The second issue is that we can&#8217;t
                                        really ever strike the right balance
                                        between explosion and coherence in
                                        defining the scope of a component. The
                                        best example I know of this is the
                                        navigation machinery. This is
                                        implemented as a collection of
                                        components that each have some scope and
                                        function and they&#8217;re glued
                                        together using the component registry.
                                        However, in most cases, I&#8217;ve
                                        wanted to simply provide a replacement
                                        wholesale, and in this case, the
                                        exploded code chain is counterproductive
                                        and needlessly complex.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        To recap, I believe the correct usage of
                                        components is to adapt on small
                                        specifications, with one-way or two-way
                                        being standard, avoid adaptation for
                                        multiplexing where possible and finally
                                        to avoid exploding our software into too
                                        many components. We still have
                                        object-oriented programming and Python
                                        is still a dynamic language.

                                        It&#8217;s pretty hard to do the matrix
                                        calculus that makes most of the various
                                        Plone constituencies happy while still
                                        doing something useful along any
                                        meaningful simplification axis. So
                                        finding some middle ground where Plone
                                        stakes out its ground as-is
                                        (&#8220;CMS&#8221;), and other tasks are
                                        delegated to other systems as necessary
                                        is probably a good idea.

                                        But at the same time, I&#8217;d probably
                                        avoid taking this route for new customer
                                        projects. Content management features
                                        aren&#8217;t too hard to create in any
                                        of the new crops of Python web
                                        frameworks. Writing a form, even
                                        auto-generating that form using some
                                        framework, accepting input from users,
                                        showing errors, managing users, etc: for
                                        any given project, satisfying these
                                        types of requirements tends to be pretty
                                        easy <em>without</em> Plone. It&#8217;s
                                        often much harder to remove unnecessary
                                        features from Plone than it is to create
                                        the necessary ones from scratch. It
                                        would take a heck of a lot of
                                        intersection between a random
                                        customer&#8217;s requirements and the
                                        feature set that Plone provides out of
                                        the box for me to use Plone as the
                                        &#8220;CMS&#8221;, and delegate other
                                        tasks to a simpler system. I&#8217;d
                                        tend to just use the simpler system for
                                        everything, left to my own devices. That
                                        said, for legacy systems that already
                                        use Plone, I&#8217;d likely go with
                                        Content Mirror.

                                        IMO, the killer feature of Plone that no
                                        other &#8220;framework&#8221; has is
                                        that it does <em>something</em> out of
                                        the box. Folks who install and use it
                                        can quickly get a frame of reference
                                        quickly, and they can describe (to
                                        themselves or others) requirements in
                                        terms of modifications to that out of
                                        the box experience. And for better or
                                        worse, people tend to do those
                                        modifications to Plone to satisfy the
                                        requirements. So it drives a good deal
                                        of consulting business.

                                        So how do we square the circle?
                                        I&#8217;m not sure. But I don&#8217;t
                                        think too many tears would be shed if
                                        something else were created that was
                                        materially simpler and offered some
                                        similar set of features out of the box.
                                        I suspect that a phoenix-from-the-flames
                                        project that aimed to recreate a
                                        Plone-ish out-of-the-box experience, but
                                        which ditched backwards compatibility
                                        would probably be most successful in the
                                        long run. There are of course Plone
                                        add-ons and such, and these are
                                        important, but even without those, an
                                        alternative could probably support a
                                        healthy community. It shouldn&#8217;t be
                                        called Plone, obviously. This of course
                                        mirrors what we&#8217;re doing with bfg
                                        vs. Zope, so I suppose my saying any of
                                        that is not very surprising.

                                        Obviously one of the biggest issues is a
                                        political one. Sure, other people can
                                        write a CMS. Someone could even pay a
                                        lot of attention to migration, and maybe
                                        pick out a handful of the most popular
                                        add-ons to also translate, and so make
                                        the intention as a successor clear. But
                                        that itself doesn&#8217;t make a New
                                        Plone.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        At some future date I think the
                                        community <em>could</em> choose to make
                                        a radical change like that &#8212; and
                                        even call the result &#8220;Plone&#8221;
                                        &#8212; but it will be easy only if
                                        Plone is a CMS and not a platform for
                                        building entire web sites. Which is why
                                        I suggest this path to making Plone into
                                        more of a CMS and less of a platform.
                                        And ultimately that question of how to
                                        make a complete website <em>must</em> be
                                        answered &#8212; another part of
                                        Plone&#8217;s success is that it answers
                                        that question. So right now recreating
                                        just the CMS of Plone wouldn&#8217;t be
                                        sufficient to really recreate Plone.
