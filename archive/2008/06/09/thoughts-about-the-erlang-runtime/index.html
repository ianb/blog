                                    using Python threads, a model for which I
                                    have no great affection (or hate). But I was

                                    by Patrick Logan on Erlang and it got me
                                    thinking again.

                                <p>
                                    From my reading and what I&#8217;ve heard
                                    from other people, Erlang the
                                    language-and-syntax seems quite crufty.
                                    Erlang is not the Complete Package, the
                                    language that will make you leave your wife,
                                    the language that will have you walking into
                                    telephone polls because it&#8217;s just so
                                    <em>hot</em> that you can&#8217;t take your
                                    eyes off it. Erlang is not that language.
                                    People seem to get excited about two things
                                    in Erlang: the concurrency model and pattern
                                    matching. I&#8217;m not quite sure why
                                    people are excited about pattern matching.

                                    understand. I remain skeptical that
                                    it&#8217;s anything special.

                                    Then there is the concurrency model (and its
                                    associated message passing), and this
                                    <em>does</em> strike me as special. You can

                                    implement that model in Python, but with
                                    none of the concrete benefits.

                                    These are the useful features I see in the
                                    concurrency model:

                                        The processes are light weight. You can
                                        start lots of processes, and they start
                                        quickly and can die off quickly without
                                        any great overhead. They aren&#8217;t
                                        OS-level processes. These are sometimes
                                        called green processes or
                                        microprocesses. There are many
                                        implementations of micro<em>threads</em>
                                        in Python, but you lose the benefits of
                                        share-nothing.

                                        The runtime makes light weight processes
                                        feasible as well. The OS overhead of a
                                        Python process is actually just a small
                                        part of the total overhead when spawning
                                        a process. Loading and initializing the
                                        runtime libraries of a Python program of
                                        even modest complexity is problematic.
                                        I&#8217;m not sure exactly how Erlang
                                        does this, but I suspect it&#8217;s
                                        because libraries can be safely shared
                                        because Erlang is a functional language.

                                    1 and 2 can be handled with the right VM.
                                    This isn&#8217;t a particularly
                                    <em>common</em> VM design, but it&#8217;s
                                    certainly doable. 3 is tricky, and effects
                                    the language design.

                                    I don&#8217;t think it effects the language
                                    design as greatly as to require a functional
                                    language. It requires that sharable code
                                    itself be a functional (i.e., immutable)
                                    subset of the language. What the code
                                    <em>does</em> doesn&#8217;t have to be
                                    functional, only what the code <em>is</em>.

                                    To explain this, functions in most languages
                                    are immutable. Python functions aren&#8217;t
                                    actually immutable, but they are close
                                    enough that hardly anyone would notice if
                                    you made them immutable (right now you can
                                    overwrite their name, compiled code, and
                                    some other stuff &#8212; but almost no one
                                    actually does this). The function may have
                                    side effects, but as long as the function
                                    <em>object</em> is immutable then it can be
                                    shared safely among processes.

                                    You can extend this to the module as a
                                    whole. This means you couldn&#8217;t

                                    objects in the module, and module-level
                                    assignments would effectively be constants.
                                    Any module-level objects would have to be
                                    immutable. Things like classes, which are
                                    also a kind of module-level object, would
                                    also have to be immutable &#8212; meaning
                                    things like class variables would be
                                    immutable. It could still be possible to do
                                    module-level code if there was a way of
                                    freezing the module after its instantiation
                                    (this would be important for Python, as even
                                    decorators are a kind of code run at import
                                    time). Adding a general concept of
                                    &quot;freezing&quot; to the language might
                                    be the most general and expedient way to
                                    make modules sharable.

                                    The other half of the concurrency model in
                                    Erlang is message passing. Erlang processes
                                    send messages around like other systems send
                                    methods. It would be possible to use exactly
                                    Erlang&#8217;s system, as it&#8217;s not
                                    Erlang-specific and has been ported to many
                                    languages. Though I&#8217;d be somewhat more
                                    inclined to use

                                    as it has some cleverness in its design. Or
                                    perhaps JSON, just because. Regardless of
                                    the format you are always passing around
                                    <em>data</em>, which I think is important.
                                    Systems that pass around &quot;objects&quot;
                                    become complex, mostly because you just
                                    <strong>cannot</strong> pass objects around
                                    and so those systems are just complex
                                    facades built around data exchange.

                                    Lately I&#8217;ve become fond of thinking of
                                    objects as views over a more fundamental
                                    data structure (<a

                                    is strictly based on this pattern). Methods
                                    are details of the implementation, but only
                                    the data can mean something to someone else.
                                    At least this is the worldview you start to
                                    internalize when you think about REST a lot.

                                    anti-pattern. That anti-pattern is one where
                                    you get all the disadvantages of dynamic
                                    typing, and all the disadvantages of static
                                    typing, all in one ugly bundle.
                                    Erlang&#8217;s records remind me of this
                                    anti-pattern. Instead of dictionaries
                                    everything is a tuple, and getting a record
                                    is just syntactic sugar mapping record names
                                    to indexes &#8212; all in the context of a
                                    dynamically typed language where you could
                                    mistype a value and get strange output as a
                                    result.
                                </p>

                                    The strong-static typing solution to the
                                    type problem involves complicated contracts,
                                    aka &quot;service descriptions&quot;, the
                                    stuff of WS-*, CORBA IDL, etc. The
                                    strong-dynamic typing solution is that every
                                    object have an explicit type. This is fine
                                    for things we all agree on: lists,
                                    dictionaries, bytes, numbers. Sadly even a
                                    basic thing like unicode strings cause
                                    problems, as do dates, but at least those
                                    have straight-forward solutions (you add
                                    more basic types to the message format).
                                    More complex types, like a domain object
                                    (e.g., a user record) are difficult. Are
                                    they all just dictionaries? Dictionaries
                                    plus special metadata? XML namespaces
                                    address this problem in some ways, but are
                                    also the point at which XML starts to just
                                    piss people off and make them want to use
                                    JSON. And for good reason, because XML
                                    namespaces force you to define entities and
                                    responsible parties very early on, possibly
                                    long before you know what you are actually
                                    trying to do. Besides XML, are there other
                                    systems that aren&#8217;t just
                                    naive/unextendable (bencode, JSON) and are
                                    still basically dynamically typed?

                                        missing is hot code reloading. Hot code
                                        reloading is hard in Python for a lot of
                                        complicated reasons, but it&#8217;s easy
                                        in Erlang for three key reasons:

                                                since it&#8217;s a functional
                                                language everything is on the
                                                stack AND the way to write a
                                                loop is to do a tail call so you
                                                have lots of opportunities to
                                                upgrade running code (the next
                                                time you call the function you
                                                simply use the new version of
                                                the function &#8212; of course
                                                this is opt-in depending on
                                                whether you&#8217;re using a
                                                local or absolute call).

                                        </li>
                                    </ol>

                                    <p>
                                        Records aren&#8217;t really used for
                                        interop, they&#8217;re typically used
                                        within a single module as an internal
                                        data structure (opaque to anything else)
                                        or at worst within an application.
                                        Sometimes this bleeds through and
                                        becomes an API (e.g. Yaws or the file
                                        module) but that&#8217;s the exception
                                        and not the rule. In any case, they suck
                                        to use because they&#8217;re not
                                        extensible and the syntax is annoying,
                                        but they do have some nice performance
                                        properties.
                                    </p>

                                        It&#8217;s worth noting that since
                                        Erlang started supporting SMP, its
                                        processes are M:N microprocesses per
                                        core. Any and all Python microprocess
                                        implementations are going to be M:1
                                        microprocesses per core due to the GIL
                                        if nothing else.

                                        The other big, very difficult to copy
                                        thing is the error handling. Erlang
                                        handles remote and local failures in an
                                        impressively smooth and integrated way.
                                        The model of &#8220;failure is caught by
                                        some other monitoring process&#8221; is
                                        not at all easy to replicate without
                                        fairly deep support from the VM.

                                        I would add, Erland is also designed for
                                        application uptimes measured in years.
                                        Erlang assumes you want the application
                                        to run on two or more machines, you can
                                        add more machines, and bring down
                                        machines at will
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        (obviously you have to program in a
                                        particular style to get the benefit,
                                        where anything and everything is assumed
                                        to fail at one time or another, and some
                                        other process is called to pick up the
                                        dropped ball. You can write in Erlang,
                                        in poor style or with poor engineering,
                                        applications that cannot do this.)

                                        It seems like hot reloading would be
                                        feasible simply by way of having cheap
                                        processes&#8230;? With cheap processes
                                        you can kill processes with old code and
                                        start new ones. Of course
                                        messages-as-data is also essential. Is
                                        code reloading on a smaller granularity
                                        also important?
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        Maybe another feature is support for
                                        asynchronous calls. Or at least support
                                        for that pattern. At least, that seems
                                        helpful for message passing, and seems
                                        similar for error handling, though I
                                        don&#8217;t really know any of the
                                        details of Erlang on that level. Is
                                        Erlang good at async? I&#8217;m thinking
                                        about things like all the awkwardness of
                                        Twisted, which is a parallel awkwardness
                                        of both function calls and exceptions,
                                        so it feels like both problems could be
                                        solved at once, and work over the
                                        process barrier as a result.

                                        Hot code reloading is not feasible
                                        simply by having cheap processes. You
                                        don&#8217;t want to kill old processes
                                        that run old code and start new ones.
                                        That&#8217;s the same as shutting down
                                        and starting back up, you want a
                                        seamless upgrade.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        Erlang ONLY does async. Synchronous
                                        message passing in Erlang is a pair of
                                        async message send and blocking
                                        selective receive.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        You really just need to learn Erlang,
                                        much more useful than talking about how
                                        you think Erlang might work. It&#8217;s
                                        not a big language.

                                        I guess I need something that is worth
                                        using Erlang for. Learning a language
                                        without a purpose (even a kind of silly
                                        purpose) feels fake.

                                        Is <em>everything</em> async? Like, ever
                                        function call, every anything? I guess
                                        on some level you couldn&#8217;t tell if
                                        you are in a system with no side
                                        effects&#8230; it&#8217;s just an

                                        Ian, with regard to async everything,
                                        there are two parts to erlang. The pure
                                        functional sub section is known as
                                        &#8216;sequential&#8217; erlang and has
                                        pretty much the same semantics you would
                                        expect from any language where you can
                                        do FP (python, lisp, JS etc). The send
                                        operator (<code>!</code>) and
                                        <code>receive</code> syntax let you
                                        write processes that communicate and it
                                        is anything built on these that are
                                        async.
                                    </p>

                                        funny that we were talking about this on
                                        the #pypy channel today (and I just read
                                        your post now). Stackless do have
                                        corotines that are interesting as you
                                        don&#8217;t have any problem with the
                                        gil (as it is running just one thread)
                                        and if you have the scalability of
                                        erlang (various process on the same or
                                        other machines passing messages to each
                                        other) you end up with a similar system
                                        of concurrency. The remaining problems
                                        are the shared memory for corotines.

                                        Pypy people are usually interested in
                                        this kind of stuff, but they all seem to
                                        be doing other projects right now (like
                                        working on the JIT and on making ctypes
                                        fast). I think they would welcome you
                                        there if you want to stop by on
                                        freenode.net for a chat (I certanly
                                        would).

                                        About the twisted thing, they have now a
                                        corotwine package that mixes twisted and
                                        corotines, which might be interesting to
                                        you.

                                        might be the most general and expedient

                                        languages as I was idly chatting with
                                        Peter Norvig a short while ago &#8212;
                                        that&#8217;s what they did at Harlequin
                                        for Dylan, and it worked wonders
                                        (apparently gets great synergy with type
                                        inferencing and jit/specializing a la
                                        psyco). Which is in weird contrast with
                                        what I heard from Ruby experts years ago
                                        as I lauded their language&#8217;s
                                        having that &#8220;freezing&#8221;
                                        concept &#8212; apparently it
                                        isn&#8217;t (wasn&#8217;t?) really used
                                        much and/or didn&#8217;t work well (I
                                        wonder if it&#8217;s just the fact that,
                                        particularly a few years ago,
                                        optimization and good threading were
                                        pretty bad in Ruby&#8217;s
                                        implementation, and at the same time
                                        monekeypatching appears to be a strong
                                        cultural meme in Ruby, much more than in
                                        Python&#8230;).

                                        I think you are missing the interaction
                                        of many features:
                                    </p>

                                    <ul>
                                        <li>
                                            <p>
                                                Pattern matching. Yes it is
                                                possible to <em>add</em> pattern
                                                matching to many languages, but
                                                in Erlang (as in many
                                                functional/logic languages) it
                                                is an integral part of the
                                                language and used everywhere.
                                            </p>
                                        </li>

                                                Error handling. This is possible
                                                only because of share-nothing
                                                processes. The error handling is
                                                an integral part of the language
                                                as well and definitely affects
                                                how you build applications.

                                                Immutable data. This actually
                                                makes the world much easier to
                                                comprehend once you get around
                                                the mental block. It also means
                                                that there are no back doors to
                                                process communication, there is
                                                only message passing. Which
                                                means that you can make
                                                distribution transparent,
                                                &#8230;
                                            </p>
                                        </li>
                                    </ul>

                                    <p>Etc.</p>

                                    <p>
                                        The problem is not that you can&#8217;t
                                        implement these features on other
                                        languages, in many cases you can, or
                                        that the concepts are new, they&#8217;re
                                        not (actors are older than erlang). No,
                                        the problem is to get all the benefits
                                        of these features as you do in Erlang
                                        you need them built in and integrated
                                        with each other from the beginning. Just
                                        looking at each one separately does not
                                        show you the power of them working
                                        together. This also means that adding
                                        this feature or that to another language
                                        will not get you all the either. It will
                                        just not cut it.

                                        Its true that pattern matching can be
                                        added to any language but it is
                                        ingrained in erlang and is used
                                        consistently throughout.

                                        For me, the syntax of Erlang is
                                        beautiful, in the same way that LISP is,
                                        it is simple and elegant and does not
                                        require an encyclopedic knowledge of
                                        sytax.

                                        Add that to the powerful libraries,
                                        particularly OTP and mnesia and you have
                                        the makings of a distributed toolset
                                        rather than language.

                                        Re: crufty syntax. Think of how wrong
                                        all the people who complain about
                                        Python&#8217;s significant whitespace as
                                        being crufty syntax are. Maybe you are
                                        like me and was one of those people
                                        until you started using it and now you
                                        really hate languages that have needless
                                        punctuation like {} END.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        After learning / lightly using Erlang
                                        for a month I hardly notice the syntax
                                        anymore. And I&#8217;m starting to get
                                        annoyed that in Python I have to
                                        surround the atom equivalent with
                                        quotes, but only in some places!
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        Also, It seems I write less Erlang than
                                        Python expressing the same code (Pattern
                                        matching is big reason for that). So,
                                        even if it is crufty there&#8217;s less
                                        of it to deal with.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        Finally, there are macro packages that
                                        let you write Erlang in Lisp like syntax
                                        and one that is Python indentation like.
                                    </p>

                                        Several good comments on the many
                                        benefits of Erlang and especially the
                                        combination of those into the sum
                                        greater than the parts kind of thing.
                                        One more to point out&#8230;
                                    </p>

                                        Messaging and pattern matching in Erlang
                                        are deeply intertwined, i.e.
                                        &#8220;selective pattern-based
                                        receive&#8221;. If you just accept
                                        messages over various pipes and you just
                                        pattern match on various language data
                                        structures, you still don&#8217;t obtain
                                        the benefits of an intertwined mechanism
                                        for pattern matching within the
                                        &#8220;per thread&#8221; (shared nothing
                                        thread in Erlang) mailbox.
                                    </p>

                                        Erlang is subtly, specially simple in
                                        its own way, just as Python&#8217;s
                                        various object, meta, syntactical foo
                                        makes it expressive in its own way. What
                                        we really need are simple, efficient
                                        ways to interact between Erlang, Python,
                                        and other systems, not necessarily, if
                                        ever, running in the same OS process. We
                                        need to easily spin each of these things
                                        up to do their own work and use each
                                        other.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        Such a mechanism exists for Python and
                                        Java and C to interact with Erlang, but
                                        we need more general foo.

                                    <p>
                                        The problem with &#8220;all these pieces
                                        work together perfectly&#8221; is that
                                        &#8212; according to hearsay &#8212;
                                        they work together perfectly to write
                                        protocol stacks and distributed
                                        databases and stuff like that. You know
                                        what? I don&#8217;t care about that kind
                                        of stuff. I would like to write stupid
                                        crap like web applications. And &#8212;
                                        according to hearsay &#8212; Erlang
                                        isn&#8217;t good at that. Relevant
                                        aspects of the language (and/or
                                        libraries) sound quite painful. So
                                        <em>something</em> is off. Is it just
                                        too immature an environment (at least
                                        for that domain)? Or is there something
                                        wrong with it? I can write some
                                        functional code when I&#8217;m dealing
                                        with a Very Hard Problem. But you know,
                                        most problems aren&#8217;t Very Hard,
                                        and I&#8217;d rather not twist my brain
                                        to solve those problems. Web programming
                                        is just Not Very Hard, even given the
                                        concurrency issues.

                                        I know enough [Twisted](<a

                                        >) to know that&#8217;s the wrong way to
                                        write web applications. Maybe it&#8217;s
                                        the right way to write servers that
                                        interact directly with sockets.
                                        <em>Maybe</em>. I don&#8217;t know much
                                        Twisted at all, yet I feel pretty
                                        confident about my opinion. Erlang takes
                                        a somewhat different approach, and
                                        obviously has the language support to
                                        back that approach where Twisted does
                                        not. But while I know less about Erlang
                                        than I do about Twisted &#8212; and I
                                        should rectify that &#8212; I
                                        can&#8217;t help but notice a lack of
                                        people claiming Erlang is the Complete
                                        Package, or even anywhere close to it.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        So&#8230; what should I expect to find
                                        out, ultimately? That Erlang is
                                        super-awesome and I&#8217;m going to
                                        stop using anything else? That
                                        share-nothing is nice, but in order to
                                        get it I&#8217;ll need to use something
                                        more like CGI (ala App Engine)? That
                                        some hybrid approach is workable, using
                                        Erlang for things like a database (e.g.,
                                        [Couch](<a
                                            href="http://incubator.apache.org/couchdb/"
                                            rel="nofollow"
                                            >http://incubator.apache.org/couchdb/</a
                                        >)) but writing all <em>my</em> code
                                        using traditional concurrency
                                        techniques? If the last one is the case
                                        (I guess what Patrick is proposing)
                                        then&#8230; do I need to care about
                                        Erlang? If I deploy CouchDB and use it
                                        from Python, what should I care what
                                        CouchDB implemented in? I don&#8217;t
                                        worry a great deal about what MySQL is
                                        written in.

                                        Yeah. I don&#8217;t know that I was
                                        actually thinking about anything
                                        specific, but this is essentially it.

                                        The &#8220;application specific&#8221;
                                        parts of a web application seem easy in
                                        Python, Ruby, etc. The &#8220;system
                                        specific&#8221; parts seem fairly easy
                                        in Erlang. What would be great would be
                                        the ability to integrate these two
                                        easily.

                                        So rather than a Django application
                                        running in all Python (I assume &#8212;
                                        don&#8217;t know much about Django)
                                        instead the distributed, supervisory,
                                        scale-outing stuff in Erlang and the app
                                        per se in Python. But the Python
                                        developer does not have to know that the
                                        system stuff is in Erlang.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        And the system stuff in Erlang could
                                        just as well be running apps in Python
                                        as well as Ruby or who-knows-what.

                                        To work with MySQL you have an
                                        integration protocol. Same with Erlang
                                        and other languages. Although it could
                                        be easier.

                                        Another example I&#8217;ve dealt with in
                                        the past: the CLIPS rules engine, and
                                        Python has a nice integration: PyCLIPS.
                                        I&#8217;d like to have a farm of rules
                                        engines, talk to them through some
                                        scalable, distributed, supervisable
                                        mechanism just like what Erlang/OTP
                                        provides. But talk to them as
                                        Python/PyCLIPS &#8220;services&#8221;.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        It&#8217;s very &#8220;do-able&#8221;
                                        but fairly ad hoc. Especially if part of
                                        the system is in Ruby, part is in
                                        Erlang, and part is in Python (and part
                                        in CLIPS (lisp, if no using PyCLIPS)).

                                        Dealing with a very heterogeneous system
                                        can be quite challenging, but I think
                                        it&#8217;s doable. Using a protocol like
                                        HTTP (what CouchDB uses, for instance)
                                        is probably quite helpful, as it&#8217;s
                                        a protocol that all languages and
                                        environments are familiar with. JSON or
                                        XML or something along those lines has a
                                        similar advantage. Sure, you can make
                                        other systems understand Erlang&#8217;s
                                        messages, but you don&#8217;t get the
                                        tool support, existing libraries,
                                        developer knowledge, etc.

                                        Maintaining a heterogeneous system is
                                        also difficult, but a separate problem.
                                        Maintaining <em>anything</em> is a
                                        problem, it&#8217;s just one that
                                        happens to scale O(n) for n kinds of
                                        systems.

                                        Yes, I think that&#8217;s the current
                                        big challenge that is being ignored by
                                        the continuing excitement over
                                        &#8220;many languages in a single
                                        VM&#8221;. We need better ways to do
                                        &#8220;many languages in many VMs on
                                        many nodes&#8221;.

                                        Primarily that seems like a job for HTTP

                                        I think a lot of the cases where people
                                        want many languages in a single VM are
                                        heavily motivated by systems
                                        maintenance. Especially with the JVM,
                                        after people make claims about All The
                                        Great Libraries You&#8217;ll Be Able To
                                        Use, the advantage noted is the ability
                                        to run everything in one container, one
                                        build process, etc.
                                    </p>

                                        Oddly, when people think about this
                                        second problem they seem to ignore the
                                        possibility that instead of changing
                                        runtimes dramatically they could just
                                        fix their build process. (The
                                        challenging part is that fixing the
                                        build process in this way usually
                                        involves pushing complexity out of the
                                        build and up into the language,
                                        framework, and application &#8212; but
                                        it seems to be worth it.)

                                        I&#8217;m primarily a Python programmer
                                        getting my feet wet with projects
                                        combining Python and Erlang. Probably
                                        the best way to get the gist of Erlang
                                        is to read/skim Joe Armstrong&#8217;s
                                        thesis:

                                    <p>
                                        I&#8217;ve dabbled in Scheme, Common
                                        Lisp, Ada, and other languages, but
                                        Erlang is the only language I&#8217;ve
                                        decided to actually use for real work in
                                        the past 10 years other than Python. In
                                        my experience, languages like Python and
                                        Erlang <em>complement</em> each other.
                                        Neither language does everything.
                                        It&#8217;s important to remember that
                                        all languages have design trade-offs due
                                        to their emphasis.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        Erlang is most definitely worth
                                        learning, but not because it is
                                        &#8220;better&#8221; than favorite
                                        language X, or because it is designed to
                                        completely replace your favorite
                                        language, but because it made trade-offs
                                        that other languages didn&#8217;t, that
                                        solve the big difficult problems of
                                        software that are very difficult or
                                        impossible to fully solve in other
                                        languages without making the same
                                        extreme trade-offs. Let Erlang make the
                                        trade-offs so your other language
                                        doesn&#8217;t have to. :-) A realistic
                                        and common approach is to combine Erlang
                                        with other languages, like Python.

                                        Here is a comparison of some of the
                                        trade-offs and reasoning behind the
                                        different languages. (For more details
                                        on the Erlang side, please read the
                                        thesis PDF.)

                                        Python and concurrency: Python has the
                                        GIL to make it easier for C to interact
                                        with Python (from what I&#8217;ve
                                        heard). The GIL could be removed, but
                                        supposedly writing C towards Python
                                        would have been made more complicated.
                                        The <em>advantage</em> of the GIL is
                                        that Python is a great glue language as
                                        a result. The disadvantage is reduced
                                        ability to take advantage of threads.
                                        But I think Python got it right when
                                        deciding to go multi-process as a
                                        solution, and Erlang also agrees on this
                                        design philosophy of using processes.

                                        Erlang and concurrency: People should
                                        keep in mind the context in which Erlang
                                        was created. It was for telecoms, where
                                        the system <em>must</em> be reliable and
                                        never go down, while also supporting a
                                        high amount of
                                        <em>reliable</em> concurrency. Deferring
                                        concurrency to OS-level threads or
                                        OS-level processes wouldn&#8217;t work,
                                        either because they&#8217;re too slow,
                                        or because shared-state is unreliable.
                                        Deferring to the OS also can make
                                        concurrency inconvenient or sacrifice
                                        portability, or at least consistency in
                                        performance across platforms. The
                                        conclusion was to create lightweight,
                                        runtime-level processes. These are not
                                        the same as many tasklet, coroutine,
                                        pseudo-thread, etc. implementations. The
                                        processes must be truly concurrent, not
                                        cooperative, and they cannot share
                                        state. This separation adds to the
                                        additional goal of fault isolation.
                                        Processes aren&#8217;t just a feature,
                                        they are the unit-of-work much like how
                                        objects are for pure object-oriented
                                        languages. Processes communicate through
                                        messages. Supposedly, message-passing
                                        was a key concept of object-orientation
                                        in Smalltalk that was lost in C++, Java,
                                        etc. So, processes are analogous to
                                        objects (or you can consider them
                                        objects from a certain point of view),
                                        except they are naturally concurrent and
                                        provide more physical separation than
                                        multiple objects within the same process
                                        in other languages.

                                        Python and libraries: Python readily
                                        binds to C/C++ libraries, and this is
                                        convenient. But what happens if that
                                        library itself has a serious bug?
                                        I&#8217;ve personally experienced times
                                        when (especially a C++ library, such as
                                        earlier versions of wxPython or
                                        beta-quality 3D engines) would crash
                                        Python, even though Python itself is
                                        stable. The trade-off is that Python
                                        readily talks to all sorts of libraries
                                        easily, but risks being at the mercy of
                                        failures from those libraries. As
                                        another example, try using ctypes where
                                        the C library is coded badly. For many
                                        people, the convenience is worth the
                                        risk. For others where the system
                                        <em>must not</em> go down (e.g.
                                        telecoms, mission-critical servers,
                                        control apps), the convenience
                                        isn&#8217;t worth the risk. It&#8217;s a
                                        different emphasis/trade-off.

                                        languages, you use a &#8220;port&#8221;
                                        in Erlang, where the external language
                                        is a separate process that acts as an
                                        Erlang process from Erlang&#8217;s point
                                        of view. The trade-off is that you get
                                        fault isolation (which is an
                                        <em>explicit</em> goal of Erlang, but
                                        not an <em>explicit</em> goal of Python,
                                        although desirable) at the expense of
                                        some extra work. External code
                                        won&#8217;t crash Erlang if
                                        they&#8217;re utilized as ports.

                                        Python error handling: Python uses
                                        error-trapping with try/except, like
                                        other languages that have try/catch,
                                        etc. Because a process is not the de
                                        facto unit-of-work for Python,
                                        it&#8217;s natural that error handling
                                        is performed within the same process (by
                                        default). Although, you could probably
                                        act on the exception with a distributed
                                        call, the error-trapping is always
                                        essentially performed in the same
                                        process.

                                        Erlang error handling: Fault-tolerance
                                        is an explicit Erlang goal. That means
                                        guarding against
                                        <em>hardware</em> failure, and not just
                                        software exceptions. The only way to
                                        guard against hardware failure is
                                        through distributed programming, i.e.
                                        redundancy and fail-over. This is more
                                        than just watching a heart-beat, it can
                                        involve any sort of error or exception.
                                        The requirement that the error-trapping
                                        occurs in the same process as the error
                                        makes distributed programming more
                                        difficult or less robust. Often the
                                        process can&#8217;t continue and
                                        shouldn&#8217;t even try, and so the
                                        sensible thing to do is to detect that
                                        is the case, crash the process, and
                                        restart the process or
                                        <em>groups</em> of related processes,
                                        where this might even be done from a
                                        non-local supervisory process. The exact
                                        semantics of how this is done is subtly
                                        different than other languages. Maybe
                                        you could do it, but not without a lot
                                        of work. Technically you can do anything
                                        in C that you could do in Python, but
                                        the point is to use the best tool for
                                        the job. For fault-tolerant sorts of
                                        things, Erlang is most likely the best
                                        tool for the job.

                                    <p>
                                        There is much more than this (behaviors,
                                        supervision hierarchies, etc.) but by
                                        now it should be apparent that Python
                                        and Erlang do their jobs well, but they
                                        were meant for different jobs. But there
                                        is no reason that such jobs aren&#8217;t
                                        complementary. For example, I&#8217;d
                                        looked at Twisted too, and it is so
                                        foreign from most normal Python code
                                        that you might as well learn another
                                        language. Especially because it
                                        doesn&#8217;t have the built-in
                                        facilities for distributed message
                                        passing at the language level,
                                        distributed error handling,
                                        share-nothing semantics, etc.

                                        If you want one reason to learn Erlang,
                                        it is this: no other language has seemed
                                        to solve the problem of
                                        <em>reliable</em> concurrency anywhere
                                        near as well. And that is kind of
                                        important. Erlang seems to be the only
                                        language that comes close to readily
                                        scaling linearly in performance with
                                        multi-core and distributed. Little
                                        things like pattern matching and
                                        single-assignment are part of the goal
                                        for reliability, but in themselves
                                        aren&#8217;t the whole point.

                                        &gt; Besides XML, are there other
                                        systems that aren’t just
                                        naive/unextendable (bencode, JSON) and
                                        are still basically dynamically typed?
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        Thrift, while not dynamic in the classic
                                        sense, seems to do a good job at
                                        creating extensible interfaces with a
                                        defined but flexible contract (IDL) that
                                        are usable in both dynamic and static
                                        languages. All in all, from what
                                        I&#8217;ve seen so far, it&#8217;s a
                                        pragmatic compromise weighting the
                                        different forces in the right way (IMHO,
                                        anyway).
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        Unlike Hessian, it also doesn&#8217;t
                                        favour one language. Hessian does so for
                                        Java, all the clients for other
                                        languages are fig leafs.
