                                                the stupidity of the driver.
                                                Throw in a disgusted sneer and
                                                snort if you like. It&#8217;s
                                                not necessarily the driver that
                                                you&#8217;re targeting, the
                                                people around you are probably
                                                more likely to affect purchasing
                                                decisions.

                                            hate as environmental discussions
                                            go.

                                            I hate SUVs too. There&#8217;s a
                                            very small number of people who have
                                            good reason to own an SUV. Everyone
                                            else should own a normal car or a
                                            minivan (more practical in all the
                                            ways that matter, it just
                                            doesn&#8217;t look as cool). OK, the
                                            irony is that the minivan
                                            isn&#8217;t going to be much more
                                            efficient, it&#8217;s just that
                                            I&#8217;ll trust you have
                                            <em>good reason</em> to own a big
                                            vehicle, because you&#8217;ll have
                                            weighed the utility against the
                                            supreme uncoolness of a minivan. And
                                            anyway, four people barreling down
                                            the highway in a minivan is more
                                            efficient than one person in a
                                            Prius. With an SUV I&#8217;ll always
                                            suspect vanity. And what&#8217;s
                                            worse, I won&#8217;t think less of
                                            you just because of the resources
                                            you take up (not just carbon, but
                                            street space, visual, impact,
                                            etc)&#8230; I&#8217;ll also think
                                            less of you because I&#8217;ll have
                                            you pegged as a dumb consumer. And
                                            don&#8217;t give me any bullshit
                                            about getting around in the snow
                                            &#8212; then I&#8217;ll just peg you
                                            as a lousy driver, because
                                            I&#8217;ve been driving out of snow
                                            drifts in crappy low-clearance
                                            underpowered cars all my life
                                            without much trouble.

                                            But I digress. Yeah, SUVs are shit.
                                            So what does it matter if I think
                                            so? I can only not buy an SUV so
                                            many times. If I don&#8217;t buy a
                                            <em>million</em> SUVs will I have
                                            saved the world? No. So, like Mike I
                                            wish I could get
                                            <em>other</em> people not to buy
                                            SUVs. I&#8217;ve considered tagging
                                            SUVs with

                                            more than piss some people off? If I
                                            make some soccer-mom type feel
                                            guilty, will I have actually
                                            accomplished anything? I think
                                            she&#8217;s a stupid consumer, and
                                            probably self-centered in her
                                            choice, but do I actually want that
                                            person to feel bad, or mad, or
                                            unjustly accused? The only outcome I
                                            can think of is some negative
                                            reaction, and <em>maybe</em> that
                                            reaction could be productive. But
                                            probably not.

                                            The idea really fell apart as I
                                            reflected on all the Hispanic people
                                            in their SUVs going to the Catholic
                                            church next door, and realized that
                                            if I tagged one of their SUVs it
                                            would probably be even more
                                            pointless. This was their symbol of
                                            success, and you certainly
                                            can&#8217;t fault them for getting a
                                            big vehicle if they are filling it
                                            up, even if their particular choice
                                            of SUV was just a reflection of
                                            cowboy dreams &#8212; but when they
                                            bought the SUV instead of the
                                            minivan they only wasted some money,
                                            they didn&#8217;t really do any
                                            worse for the world.

                                            of SUVs, I feel environmentalism has
                                            a real problem. It is built on

                                            doesn&#8217;t do anything, it
                                            can&#8217;t do anything. All we have
                                            is guilt, a sense of collective
                                            responsibility, fear over some
                                            collective doom.

                                            Guilt is a crappy foundation for a
                                            movement. One thing our commercial
                                            and consumerist world has going for
                                            it: there&#8217;s no guilt. The
                                            salesman won&#8217;t question why
                                            you are buying something. It&#8217;s
                                            always &quot;thank you sir, have a
                                            nice day!&quot; And even though
                                            sophisticated people will mock the
                                            insincerity of the expression,
                                            we&#8217;re still human and a kind
                                            word and a smile still makes us feel
                                            better, no matter how our rational
                                            mind rejects it.

                                            common reactions to guilt are
                                            avoidance, procrastination,
                                            resentment. Guilt is a
                                            <em>horrible</em> way to achieve
                                            action. <em>Judgment</em> can be a
                                            way to build group identity, and
                                            environmentalism has achieved this.
                                            It means something to be an
                                            &quot;environmentalist&quot;. But
                                            that&#8217;s hardly the goal, is it?
                                        </p>

                                            People <em>want</em> to do the right
                                            thing for the world. They want to
                                            stop global warming, they want to
                                            reduce pollution, save wildlife, all
                                            that stuff. All the surveys show
                                            this. We&#8217;re not going to get
                                            any closer to consensus (on
                                            <em>goals</em>) than we are already.
                                            If we, collectively and
                                            individually, are still not doing
                                            what we need to, then it is not for
                                            lack of a collective desire, or even
                                            a lack of education.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            So how do we turn desire into
                                            action? I don&#8217;t think guilt is
                                            a good way to do it. I&#8217;m not
                                            sure I like that path anyway. Is it
                                            an irrational reaction to guilt that
                                            we try to avoid judgment? Is it
                                            irrational that people are drawn to
                                            an environment where they are told
                                            they are good, where they are
                                            accepted, where they can act to
                                            achieve clear goals (even if that is
                                            just a purchase), where they can
                                            succeed? Consumerism may only draw
                                            people to an unimpressive local
                                            maximum of happiness, but it always
                                            makes the pursuit clear, consumerism
                                            draws you forward, consumerism
                                            offers a clear path.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            And even if you choose to accept and
                                            respond to the guilt of
                                            environmentalism, it won&#8217;t
                                            stop. First you turn the water off
                                            while you are brushing your teeth.
                                            Then you get rid of the SUV. You
                                            replace your bulbs with CFLs. Are
                                            you ready to get rid of your drier?
                                            Put your thermostat at 60F? Eat
                                            organic? Stop eating meat? Join or
                                            start a co-op? Get a composting
                                            toilet? Go off the grid?
                                            There&#8217;s always more to be
                                            done, there&#8217;s always another
                                            thing to feel guilty about not
                                            doing. It&#8217;s disheartening.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            Is there a way environmentalism can
                                            be less depressing? Less
                                            guilt-driven? Less accusing and
                                            judgmental? Can environmentalism be
                                            less dismal, more happy?
                                            Environmentalism is trying to drive
                                            a wedge between what people
                                            <em>want</em> and what they
                                            <em>do</em>. Putting aside moral
                                            arguments, is this an effective way
                                            to make change?
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            Considering my carbon footprint has
                                            only made this worse. Every action
                                            is negative. Everything I do has a
                                            cost. Pursuing carbon neutrality
                                            feels like a pursuit of
                                            non-existence. People are
                                            questioning the growth imperative,
                                            but at least growth has a certain
                                            excitement to it. Do we step into
                                            the future with confidence or fear?
                                            Do we take each step with
                                            trepidation and dread? What a
                                            horrible way to come into contact
                                            with our future selves! I want to
                                            meet all of our future selves with
                                            arms open. Buying shit is a poor
                                            substitute for that optimism. But
                                            dammit, I want to be optimistic. I
                                            don&#8217;t want to just be guilty.

                                            I thought I&#8217;d do a performance
                                            comparison of several parsers and
                                            document models.

                                            I expected lxml to perform well, as
                                            it is based on the C library
                                            <a
                                                class="reference external"

                                            >. But it performed better than I
                                            realized, far better than any other
                                            library. As a result, if it
                                            wasn&#8217;t for some persistent
                                            installation problems (especially on
                                            Macs) I would recommend lxml for
                                            just about any HTML task.

                                            Things to note: lxml is 6x faster
                                            than even HTMLParser, even though
                                            HTMLParser isn&#8217;t
                                            <em>doing</em> anything (lxml is
                                            building a tree in memory). I
                                            didn&#8217;t include all the things
                                            html5lib can parse to, because they
                                            all take about the same amount of
                                            time. xml.dom.minidom is only
                                            included because it is so noticeably
                                            slow. Genshi is fairly fast, but
                                            it&#8217;s the most fragile of the
                                            parsers. html5lib, lxml, and
                                            BeautifulSoup are all fairly
                                            similarly robust. html5lib has the
                                            benefit of (at least in theory)
                                            being <em>the</em> correct parsing
                                            of HTML.

                                            it matters often, lxml releases the
                                            GIL during parsing.

                                            Serialization is pretty fast across
                                            all the libraries, though again lxml
                                            leads the pack by a long distance.
                                            ElementTree and minidom are only
                                            doing XML serialization, but
                                            there&#8217;s no reason that the
                                            HTML equivalent would be any faster.
                                            That Genshi is slower than minidom
                                            is surprising. That
                                            <em>anything</em> is worse than
                                            minidom is generally surprising.

                                            in the way I made this test, but
                                            I&#8217;m sure it means
                                            <em>something</em>. This was done by
                                            parsing all the documents and
                                            holding the documents in memory, and

                                            grown. All the libraries should be
                                            imported when calculating the
                                            baseline, so only the documents and
                                            parsing should cause the memory
                                            increase.

                                            HTMLParser is a baseline, as it just
                                            keeps the documents in memory as a
                                            string, and creates some
                                            intermediate strings. The
                                            intermediate strings don&#8217;t end
                                            up accounting for anything, since
                                            the memory used is almost exactly
                                            the combined size of all the files.

                                            A tricky part of this measurement is
                                            that the Python allocator
                                            doesn&#8217;t let go of memory that
                                            it requests, so if a
                                            <em>parser</em> creates lots of
                                            intermediate strings and then
                                            releases them the process will still
                                            hang onto all that memory. To detect
                                            this I tried allocating new strings
                                            until the process size grew (trying
                                            to detect allocated but unused
                                            memory), but this didn&#8217;t
                                            reveal much &#8212; only the
                                            BeautifulSoup parser, serialized to
                                            an lxml tree, showed much extra
                                            memory.

                                            surprising, I guess, since I

                                            faster for cElementTree if you are

                                            its native XML parser would do).
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            lxml is probably memory efficient
                                            because it uses native libxml2 data
                                            structures, and only creates Python
                                            objects on demand.
                                        </p>
                                        <p><strong>In Conclusion</strong></p>
                                        <p>
                                            I knew lxml was fast before I
                                            started these benchmarks, but I
                                            didn&#8217;t expect it to be quite
                                            <em>this</em> fast.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            So in conclusion: lxml kicks ass.
                                            You can use it in ways you
                                            couldn&#8217;t use other systems.
                                            You can parse, serialize, parse,
                                            serialize, and repeat the process a
                                            couple times with your HTML before
                                            the performance will hurt you. With
                                            high-level constructs many
                                            constructs can happen in very fast C
                                            code without calling out to Python.
                                            As an example, if you do an XPath
                                            query, the query string is compiled
                                            into something native and traverses
                                            the native libxml2 objects, only
                                            creating Python objects to wrap the
                                            query results. In addition, things
                                            like the modest memory use make me
                                            more confident that lxml will act
                                            reliably even under unexpected load.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            I also am more confident about using
                                            a document model instead of stream
                                            parsing. It is sometimes felt that
                                            streamed parsing is better: you
                                            don&#8217;t keep the entire document
                                            in memory, and your work generally
                                            scales linearly with your document
                                            size. HTMLParser is a stream-based
                                            parser, emitting events for each
                                            kind of token (open tag, close tag,
                                            data, etc). Genshi also uses this
                                            model, with higher-level stuff like
                                            <a
                                                class="reference external"
                                                href="http://genshi.edgewall.org/wiki/Documentation/0.4.x/filters.html"
                                                >filters</a
                                            >
                                            to make it feel a bit more natural.
                                            But the stream model is
                                            <em>not</em> the natural way to
                                            process a document, it&#8217;s
                                            actually a really awkward way to
                                            handle a document that is better
                                            seen as a single thing. If you are
                                            processing gigabyte files of XML it
                                            can make sense (and both the
                                            normally document-oriented lxml and
                                            ElementTree offer options when this
                                            happens). This doesn&#8217;t make
                                            any sense for HTML. And these tests
                                            make me believe that even
                                            <em>really big</em> HTML documents
                                            can be handled quite well by lxml,
                                            so a huge outlying document
                                            won&#8217;t break a system that is
                                            appropriately optimized for handling
                                            normal sized documents.

                                            So I gave a presentation at PyCon
                                            about HTML, which I ended up turning
                                            into an XML-sucks HTML-rocks talk.
                                            Well that&#8217;s a trivialization,
                                            but <em>I</em> have the privilege of
                                            trivializing my arguments all I
                                            want.
                                        </p>

                                            Somewhat to my surprise this got me
                                            a heckler (of sorts). I think it
                                            came up when I was making my

                                            argument. That is, presentation and
                                            intention are the same. There are
                                            those people who feel they can
                                            separate the two, creating semantic
                                            markup that represents their intent,
                                            but they are so few that the
                                            <em>reader</em> can never trust that
                                            the distinction is intentional, and
                                            so

                                            that screen readers would like to
                                            distinguish between the two, as not
                                            all things we render as italic would

                                            It&#8217;s not surprising to me that
                                            the first time I&#8217;ve gotten an
                                            actively negative reaction to a talk
                                            it was about accessibility. When
                                            having technical discussions
                                            it&#8217;s hard to get that heated
                                            up. Is Python or Ruby better? We can
                                            talk shit on the web, where all
                                            emotions get mixed up and weirded,
                                            but in person these discussions tend
                                            to be quite calm and reasonable.

                                            Discussions about accessibility,
                                            however, have strong moral
                                            undertones. This isn&#8217;t just
                                            What Tool Is Right For The Job.
                                            There is a kind of moral certainty
                                            to the argument that we should be
                                            making a world that is accessible to
                                            all people.

                                            I fear this moral certainty has led
                                            people self-righteously down unwise
                                            paths. They believe &#8212; with of
                                            course some justification &#8212;
                                            that the world must be
                                            <em>made</em> right. And so many
                                            boil-the-ocean proposals are made,
                                            and even become codified by
                                            standards, but
                                            <em>markup standards</em> are
                                            useless unless embodied in
                                            <em>actual content</em>, and this is
                                            where accessibility falls down.

                                            feel like I am left adrift,
                                            unwilling to jump through the hoops

                                            want to help improve accessibility,
                                            blind people need a screen reader
                                            that isn&#8217;t crap.

                                            Months later we started talking a
                                            bit about the accessibility of
                                            <a
                                                class="reference external"
                                                href="http://openplans.org"
                                                >openplans.org</a
                                            >. Everyone wants to do the right
                                            thing, no? With my trust eroded, I
                                            argued strongly that we should only
                                            implement accessibility empirically,
                                            not based on &quot;best
                                            practices&quot;. Well, barring some
                                            patterns that seem very logical to
                                            me, like putting navigation
                                            textually at the bottom of the page,
                                            and other stuff that any
                                            self-respecting web developer does
                                            these days. But except for that, if
                                            we want to really consider
                                            accessibility we should get a tool
                                            and use it. But I don&#8217;t really
                                            know what that tool should be; JAWS
                                            is around $1000, all for what sounds
                                            like a piece of crap product. We
                                            could buy that, even though of
                                            course most web developers
                                            couldn&#8217;t possibly justify the
                                            purchase. But is that
                                            <em>really</em> the right choice? I
                                            don&#8217;t know. If we could detect
                                            something in the User-Agent string
                                            we could see what our users actually
                                            use. But I don&#8217;t think
                                            there&#8217;s information there. And
                                            I don&#8217;t know what people are
                                            using. Optimizing for screen
                                            magnifiers is much different that
                                            optimizing for screen readers.

                                            Another shortcut for accessibility
                                            &#8212; a shortcut I also distrust
                                            &#8212; is that to make a site
                                            accessible you make sure it works
                                            without Javascript. But don&#8217;t
                                            many screen readers work directly
                                            off browsers? Browsers implement
                                            Javascript. Do blind users turn
                                            Javascript off? I don&#8217;t know.
                                            If you use no-Javascript as a hint
                                            to make the site more accessible,
                                            you might just be wasting your
                                            effort.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            There&#8217;s also some weird
                                            perspective problems with
                                            accessibility. Blind users will
                                            always be a small portion of the
                                            population. It&#8217;s just
                                            unreasonable to expect sighted users
                                            to write to this small population.
                                            Relying on hidden hints in content
                                            to provide accessibility just
                                            <em>can&#8217;t work</em>. Hidden
                                            content will be broken, only visible
                                            content can be trusted. Admitting
                                            this does not mean giving up. As a
                                            sighted reader I do not expect the
                                            written and spoken word to be
                                            equivalent. I don&#8217;t think
                                            blind listeners lose anything by
                                            hearing something that is more a
                                            dialect specific to the computer
                                            translation of written text to
                                            spoken text. (Maybe treating
                                            text-to-speech as a translation
                                            effort would be more successful
                                            anyway?)
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            A freely available screen reader
                                            probably would help a lot as well. I
                                            write my markup to render in
                                            browsers, not to render to a spec.
                                            Anything else is just bad practice.
                                            I can&#8217;t seriously write my
                                            markup for readers based on a spec.

                                                Python folks are encountering
                                                with &quot;monkeypatching&quot;.
                                                However this capability is
                                                nothing new for dynamic
                                                languages. And it is a frequent

                                                C-like languages. If you become

                                            Sharp tools are good. I would not
                                            want monkeypatching removed from
                                            Python. Still, it&#8217;s best not
                                            to leave sharp tools lying around.
                                            It&#8217;s best not to mix your

                                            knives. I don&#8217;t resent the

                                            experiences are not so novel
                                            anymore. The Python community
                                            isn&#8217;t new to this dynamic
                                            typing thing. We&#8217;ve taken some
                                            hits and we&#8217;ve learned from
                                            them. And frankly the problems with
                                            runtime patching of methods
                                            can&#8217;t be specific to Python or
                                            Ruby. It only took the Ruby
                                            community a couple years to start

                                            One of the things that I think
                                            distinguishes Python among the
                                            popular dynamically typed languages
                                            of the day, is that it&#8217;s built
                                            &#8212; languages and libraries
                                            &#8212; on a great deal of concrete
                                            experience. Experience
                                            <em>about developing with Python</em
                                            >. There was a time when people
                                            tended to define Python as a delta
                                            from Java or Perl or C. We
                                            don&#8217;t need to do that anymore.
                                            Sure, closed classes in Java suck.
                                            Python isn&#8217;t a reaction to
                                            Java&#8217;s suckiness. That we can
                                            do something Java can&#8217;t
                                            doesn&#8217;t get me excited. This
                                            feature of monkeypatching has to
                                            stand up on its own, and while
                                            sometimes its use is justified those
                                            cases are few and far between.
                                            That&#8217;s what we&#8217;ve
                                            learned: monkeypatching was not
                                            dismissed out of hand, it was not
                                            dismissed because of anything in
                                            Java, it was dismissed because
                                            people <em>used</em> it without
                                            acknowledging it as a hack, and it
                                            <em>sucked</em>.

                                            Of course the use cases are still

                                            very long dead end in this maze of
                                            ideas we are traversing. Since I
                                            doubt the maze has any exit
                                            (nirvana?) it&#8217;s a valid debate
                                            about where we are trying to get at
                                            all. That said, I suspect
                                            we&#8217;ve out-explored Lisp. Lisp
                                            has been a worthy mentor, an
                                            intrepid explorer in his time, but
                                            he&#8217;s old and doesn&#8217;t get
                                            out much and only tells stories of
                                            where he&#8217;s been in the past.
                                            There are still things to be learned

                                            this year on HTML processing in
                                            Python. It seemed to be well
                                            received, but I did see some
                                            comments on the web from people who
                                            wanted more technical content. The
                                            presentation I ended up giving was
                                            really more about HTML and its place
                                            and advantages compared with XML and
                                            XHTML. Basically I decided to talk
                                            about <em>why</em> you want to
                                            process HTML, instead of getting too
                                            much into <em>how</em>. I talked a
                                            <em>little bit</em> about how, but
                                            if you had hoped to hear much
                                            technical substance then certainly
                                            it would have been disappointing.
                                            (As to the slide question, I will
                                            get them up, but I want to assemble
                                            at least a little of the material
                                            that motivated it, since slides
                                            alone aren&#8217;t that useful.)
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            I&#8217;m not sure what to do for
                                            talks like these. In 30 minutes it
                                            is hard to go into much depth about
                                            a subject. And I&#8217;m not sure
                                            what the purpose would be. If you
                                            want to learn to use a tool you
                                            should read the documentation, sit
                                            down with a computer, and give it a
                                            try. You certainly shouldn&#8217;t
                                            come to a talk. So I&#8217;ve tried
                                            to avoid the technical details, and
                                            instead try to make people
                                            <em>want</em> to learn the
                                            &quot;how&quot; on their own. This
                                            was the goal of my
                                            <a

                                            That said, the whole talk format was
                                            unsatisfying to me at PyCon.
                                            Lightning Talks are great (or at
                                            least, <em>can</em> be great &#8212;
                                            and I thought on Sunday when all the
                                            sponsors were gone, they
                                            <em>were</em> great). But 30 minute
                                            is too much time for just presenting
                                            an idea, and too little time (and a
                                            poor format) for presenting advanced
                                            content. And that slides are built
                                            into the format just makes it worse.

                                            had been more functional at PyCon. I
                                            couldn&#8217;t find the ones I
                                            wanted and felt conflicted between
                                            them and talks (in retrospect of
                                            course there shouldn&#8217;t have
                                            been conflict). I didn&#8217;t have
                                            a single successful Open Space
                                            experience this year, despite trying
                                            a couple times.

                                            While the organization of Open
                                            Spaces could be improved, I
                                            don&#8217;t think Just In Time
                                            Planning is going to work at PyCon.
                                            And I don&#8217;t think Open Spaces
                                            <em>have</em> to be JIT. What makes
                                            them most interesting isn&#8217;t
                                            that they are totally ad hoc, but
                                            that they aren&#8217;t just one
                                            person talking to a bunch of other
                                            people. I&#8217;d have been very
                                            happy to lead some more extensive
                                            &quot;talk&quot; about HTML and XML
                                            processing in Python, probably
                                            starting out with 10-15 minutes of
                                            introduction and survey and then
                                            going completely to discussion, Q/A,
                                            or wherever the attendees wanted to
                                            take it. I would expect a smaller
                                            group of people (I guess), as it
                                            would be a larger time commitment
                                            and attendance would feel less
                                            casual than just showing up at a
                                            normal talk. Maybe it could be
                                            clearly setup so that it was
                                            something like 10-15 minutes of
                                            introduction, 30-35 minutes of
                                            talking, and then a clearly planned
                                            structure for people to stop talking
                                            (moving on to another topic) or
                                            stick around to talk more in a
                                            smaller and more intimate space and
                                            group. Figuring out
                                            <em>where</em> to continue the
                                            discussion should not be left until
                                            the moment everyone has to choose
                                            whether to stay or leave.
                                            You&#8217;d have to be careful not
                                            to let it degenerate into people
                                            just asking questions of only
                                            personal interest. I&#8217;m pretty
                                            comfortable generalizing
                                            people&#8217;s overly specific
                                            questions. People who are less
                                            comfortable doing that might benefit
                                            from a moderator to help them guide
                                            the discussion.

                                            This format seems like
                                            <em>much</em> less work for me as a
                                            speaker (and the stress of speaking
                                            greatly infringes on my enjoyment of
                                            the conference), it seems more
                                            likely to fit the interests of the
                                            attendees, and I think it can
                                            provide benefit for a much wider
                                            range of interests and experience
                                            levels.
                                        </p>

                                            Anyway, an idea. I&#8217;m not sure
                                            how things <em>should</em> be
                                            structured at PyCon next year, but
                                            I&#8217;m pretty sure the current
                                            talk format isn&#8217;t it. A few
                                            talks, sure: The State Of X talks
                                            can work well, as do talks about
                                            ideas and experience instead of
                                            talks about tools and libraries. But
                                            I think one track could be
                                            sufficient.
