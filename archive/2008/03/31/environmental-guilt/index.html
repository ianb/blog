                                        your head in disappointment and disgust
                                        at the stupidity of the driver. Throw in
                                        a disgusted sneer and snort if you like.
                                        It&#8217;s not necessarily the driver
                                        that you&#8217;re targeting, the people
                                        around you are probably more likely to
                                        affect purchasing decisions.

                                    Well, a rather pedestrian level of hate as
                                    environmental discussions go.

                                    I hate SUVs too. There&#8217;s a very small
                                    number of people who have good reason to own
                                    an SUV. Everyone else should own a normal
                                    car or a minivan (more practical in all the
                                    ways that matter, it just doesn&#8217;t look
                                    as cool). OK, the irony is that the minivan
                                    isn&#8217;t going to be much more efficient,
                                    it&#8217;s just that I&#8217;ll trust you
                                    have <em>good reason</em> to own a big
                                    vehicle, because you&#8217;ll have weighed
                                    the utility against the supreme uncoolness
                                    of a minivan. And anyway, four people
                                    barreling down the highway in a minivan is
                                    more efficient than one person in a Prius.
                                    With an SUV I&#8217;ll always suspect
                                    vanity. And what&#8217;s worse, I
                                    won&#8217;t think less of you just because
                                    of the resources you take up (not just
                                    carbon, but street space, visual, impact,
                                    etc)&#8230; I&#8217;ll also think less of
                                    you because I&#8217;ll have you pegged as a
                                    dumb consumer. And don&#8217;t give me any
                                    bullshit about getting around in the snow
                                    &#8212; then I&#8217;ll just peg you as a
                                    lousy driver, because I&#8217;ve been
                                    driving out of snow drifts in crappy
                                    low-clearance underpowered cars all my life
                                    without much trouble.

                                    But I digress. Yeah, SUVs are shit. So what
                                    does it matter if I think so? I can only not
                                    buy an SUV so many times. If I don&#8217;t
                                    buy a <em>million</em> SUVs will I have
                                    saved the world? No. So, like Mike I wish I
                                    could get <em>other</em> people not to buy
                                    SUVs. I&#8217;ve considered tagging SUVs
                                    with

                                    piss some people off? If I make some
                                    soccer-mom type feel guilty, will I have
                                    actually accomplished anything? I think
                                    she&#8217;s a stupid consumer, and probably
                                    self-centered in her choice, but do I
                                    actually want that person to feel bad, or
                                    mad, or unjustly accused? The only outcome I
                                    can think of is some negative reaction, and
                                    <em>maybe</em> that reaction could be
                                    productive. But probably not.

                                    The idea really fell apart as I reflected on
                                    all the Hispanic people in their SUVs going
                                    to the Catholic church next door, and
                                    realized that if I tagged one of their SUVs
                                    it would probably be even more pointless.
                                    This was their symbol of success, and you
                                    certainly can&#8217;t fault them for getting
                                    a big vehicle if they are filling it up,
                                    even if their particular choice of SUV was
                                    just a reflection of cowboy dreams &#8212;
                                    but when they bought the SUV instead of the
                                    minivan they only wasted some money, they
                                    didn&#8217;t really do any worse for the
                                    world.

                                    But getting beyond the particulars of SUVs,
                                    I feel environmentalism has a real problem.

                                    direct action. Personal effort can result in
                                    the improvement of your personal space. But
                                    global warming? Personal action
                                    doesn&#8217;t do anything, it can&#8217;t do
                                    anything. All we have is guilt, a sense of
                                    collective responsibility, fear over some
                                    collective doom.

                                    Guilt is a crappy foundation for a movement.
                                    One thing our commercial and consumerist
                                    world has going for it: there&#8217;s no
                                    guilt. The salesman won&#8217;t question why
                                    you are buying something. It&#8217;s always
                                    &quot;thank you sir, have a nice day!&quot;
                                    And even though sophisticated people will
                                    mock the insincerity of the expression,
                                    we&#8217;re still human and a kind word and
                                    a smile still makes us feel better, no
                                    matter how our rational mind rejects it.

                                    But environmentalism? The most common
                                    reactions to guilt are avoidance,
                                    procrastination, resentment. Guilt is a
                                    <em>horrible</em> way to achieve action.
                                    <em>Judgment</em> can be a way to build
                                    group identity, and environmentalism has
                                    achieved this. It means something to be an
                                    &quot;environmentalist&quot;. But
                                    that&#8217;s hardly the goal, is it?
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    People <em>want</em> to do the right thing
                                    for the world. They want to stop global
                                    warming, they want to reduce pollution, save
                                    wildlife, all that stuff. All the surveys
                                    show this. We&#8217;re not going to get any
                                    closer to consensus (on <em>goals</em>) than
                                    we are already. If we, collectively and
                                    individually, are still not doing what we
                                    need to, then it is not for lack of a
                                    collective desire, or even a lack of
                                    education.

                                    So how do we turn desire into action? I
                                    don&#8217;t think guilt is a good way to do
                                    it. I&#8217;m not sure I like that path
                                    anyway. Is it an irrational reaction to
                                    guilt that we try to avoid judgment? Is it
                                    irrational that people are drawn to an
                                    environment where they are told they are
                                    good, where they are accepted, where they
                                    can act to achieve clear goals (even if that
                                    is just a purchase), where they can succeed?
                                    Consumerism may only draw people to an
                                    unimpressive local maximum of happiness, but
                                    it always makes the pursuit clear,
                                    consumerism draws you forward, consumerism
                                    offers a clear path.

                                    And even if you choose to accept and respond
                                    to the guilt of environmentalism, it
                                    won&#8217;t stop. First you turn the water
                                    off while you are brushing your teeth. Then
                                    you get rid of the SUV. You replace your
                                    bulbs with CFLs. Are you ready to get rid of
                                    your drier? Put your thermostat at 60F? Eat
                                    organic? Stop eating meat? Join or start a
                                    co-op? Get a composting toilet? Go off the
                                    grid? There&#8217;s always more to be done,
                                    there&#8217;s always another thing to feel
                                    guilty about not doing. It&#8217;s
                                    disheartening.

                                    Is there a way environmentalism can be less
                                    depressing? Less guilt-driven? Less accusing
                                    and judgmental? Can environmentalism be less
                                    dismal, more happy? Environmentalism is
                                    trying to drive a wedge between what people
                                    <em>want</em> and what they <em>do</em>.
                                    Putting aside moral arguments, is this an
                                    effective way to make change?
                                </p>

                                    Considering my carbon footprint has only
                                    made this worse. Every action is negative.
                                    Everything I do has a cost. Pursuing carbon
                                    neutrality feels like a pursuit of
                                    non-existence. People are questioning the
                                    growth imperative, but at least growth has a
                                    certain excitement to it. Do we step into
                                    the future with confidence or fear? Do we
                                    take each step with trepidation and dread?
                                    What a horrible way to come into contact
                                    with our future selves! I want to meet all
                                    of our future selves with arms open. Buying
                                    shit is a poor substitute for that optimism.
                                    But dammit, I want to be optimistic. I
                                    don&#8217;t want to just be guilty.

                                    <p>
                                        I feel the same way. I often feel bad
                                        about taking bags from the store that I
                                        know will just go in the garbage when I
                                        get home or buying new things because I
                                        know I&#8217;ll have to throw them away
                                        sometime.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        But if you didn&#8217;t buy anything
                                        because you knew you would have to throw
                                        it away then you wouldn&#8217;t be able
                                        to buy anything.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        Perhaps you just need to find a balance.
                                        And cut out the things you don&#8217;t
                                        need or use. Just don&#8217;t buy
                                        something that you don&#8217;t really
                                        need for a specific purpose and if you
                                        do need it justify buying it with the
                                        fact that you simply need it for a
                                        specific purpose. This way you
                                        won&#8217;t feel guilty about buying the
                                        new thing because you either
                                        didn&#8217;t buy it or you had a reason
                                        to buy it.

                                        I never really understood the SUV-hate.
                                        First of all there are different SUVs.
                                        Some are basically trucks, some are
                                        basically regular cars with a fancy
                                        body. Are we hating the body shape here
                                        or what? Is it okay to own a truck just
                                        for its &#8220;tough&#8221; image then?
                                        :-) Is minivan really so much better at
                                        aerodynamics? :-)
                                    </p>

                                        To answer your question about putting
                                        the thermostat at 60F: just say no. If I
                                        put it at 60F here in Texas I&#8217;ll
                                        go bankrupt over my air conditioner and
                                        burn a lot of fossil fuel in the
                                        process. You have to be reasonable. ;-)

                                        Regarding the ecoguilt. Some of my
                                        friends telling me that the best cure
                                        for that is to ship yourself to some
                                        Third World country with a cheap simple
                                        living where the climate is forgiving so
                                        you don&#8217;t need to worry about
                                        thermostats and their settings.
                                        Apparently the other option is being
                                        guilty. ;-)

                                        I surely hope that the world can be
                                        saved without riding the guilt train. It
                                        just needs to be cheaper to do the right
                                        thing than wasting resources. A while
                                        ago, I&#8217;ve read some interesting
                                        book:

                                        (it&#8217;s a bit similar to
                                        Freaconomics). There&#8217;s a chapter
                                        on &#8216;crosstown traffic&#8217; which
                                        discusses traffic, pollution,
                                        environment, etc. The solution: pricing
                                        should reflect the damage. There&#8217;s
                                        certainly much more to say about this,
                                        but I believe that a swift behaviour
                                        change is easier done by economic means
                                        than by moral ones.

                                        &gt; There’s a very small number of
                                        people who have good reason to own an
                                        SUV. &gt; Everyone else should own a
                                        normal car or a minivan (more practical
                                        in all &gt; the ways that matter, it
                                        just doesn’t look as cool).

                                        /not/ to own a car at all. The ideal
                                        goal should be able to walk everywhere
                                        you need to go (live close to your
                                        workplace, your shopping district etc).
                                        Failing that, public transport should be
                                        you first thought before you even think
                                        about owning a car&#8230;

                                        This is the beginning of fascism where
                                        elitist thinkers know what is
                                        &#8220;best&#8221; for you and the state
                                        is their weapon to wield the power
                                        necessary to enact their designs. The
                                        height of arrogance is that we need to
                                        &#8220;save&#8221; the planet. There is
                                        a human impulse to impose the will of
                                        one individual over another and saving
                                        the planet is just the latest excuse and
                                        the anger people feel is that their
                                        supreme intelligence in their grand
                                        plans to orchestrate humanity are not
                                        accepted without question.

                                        Why does your argument fall apart over
                                        Hispanics driving to church in SUVs and
                                        that being a status symbol for them? Do
                                        you honestly think that they only drive
                                        those vehicles to church? My guess is
                                        that mom/dad use it to drive to work all
                                        by themselves just like everyone else.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        I would argue that instead your argument
                                        falls apart over the fact that outrage
                                        over defamation of property always beats
                                        guilt. I think that attaching those
                                        bumper stickers would, except for the
                                        odd exception do nothing but trigger a
                                        backlash in the target.
                                    </p>

                                        As for the environment and getting
                                        greener, we are seeing more positive
                                        trends. Being green has entered the
                                        mainstream and is becoming a style. My
                                        friends are ridding themselves of the
                                        giant SUVs I lambasted them for years
                                        and going with more reasonable vehicles.
                                        Not over guilt, but because its now
                                        stylish and marketing targets them now
                                        to be green.

                                        As for me, I do my part. I&#8217;m a
                                        cyclist or use mass transit. Fans and
                                        windows in the summer instead of air
                                        condition. Reuse bags from the grocery
                                        when I can.

                                        &#8220;environmentalism has a real
                                        problem. It is built on guilt.&#8221;
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        It is not. Mainstream environmentalism
                                        looked the other way for the first
                                        decade of the ecologically unambiguous
                                        SUV fad, as Sierra Club benefactors
                                        cycled through one or two green
                                        (painted) Ford Explorers. Guilt is
                                        easily the least popular emotion in our
                                        culture and the movement has been afraid
                                        to project itself as a scold. It
                                        cheerfully suggests alternatives without
                                        committing to opposition of popular bad
                                        choices. And environmentalism has been,
                                        in term of results, an utter failure.
                                    </p>

                                        But that is changing, partly because

                                        hijacking of conservatism is rightly
                                        losing its grip and the politics of
                                        responsibility (of which guilt is one
                                        cog in an ancient social machine) are in
                                        restoration. Together these ecologically
                                        conscious movements are beginning to
                                        recognize the wisdom of something that
                                        both left and right dislike for

                                        that matters, as pointed out, and

                                        our collective interest in keeping the

                                        Doc: you misinterpret what I&#8217;m
                                        saying. There is an intellectual basis
                                        to environmentalism (which is the
                                        argument you seem to be trying to make),
                                        and I agree with that intellectual
                                        argument. But there is also the
                                        emotional basis to environmentalism, and
                                        in my experience this is built on guilt.
                                        Your accusatory words only serve to
                                        emphasize that. The contempt you express
                                        &#8212; a contempt which is sorely
                                        misplaced in this forum &#8212; is
                                        exactly the problem. What did you
                                        accomplish with that statement? I doubt
                                        you accomplished much of anything.
                                        It&#8217;s hardly like this is a forum
                                        for expressing love towards SUVs. I
                                        think your words are negative, not from
                                        a moral perspective but from a practical
                                        perspective, as your words lack
                                        effectiveness.

                                        Daniel: I have a hard time making the
                                        same intellectual argument to a recent
                                        immigrant that I would to someone of
                                        greater (multi-generational) privilege.
                                        It doesn&#8217;t mean the facts are
                                        different (though realistically
                                        it&#8217;s likely that the environmental
                                        impact of that immigrant is far less, as
                                        vehicles are only a small part of our
                                        individual impact). These arguments are
                                        based on how we view ourselves in
                                        relation to the world, whether we view
                                        the larger world as a responsibility,
                                        whether we feel we can effect any real
                                        change, or if we think of the world
                                        simply as a context for our personal
                                        struggles and goals. For someone whose
                                        perceived circle of influence is just
                                        themselves and their family these
                                        arguments simply lack weight, regardless
                                        of whether the argument is correct.

                                        Robin: no car at all? There are many

                                        practical. For people with no children

                                        sufficient choice of jobs, or a
                                        centrally located job (as would be the
                                        likely situation for someone working
                                        with computers), sure. These creeping
                                        expectations &#8212; first no SUV, then
                                        no car, and on and on &#8212; are part
                                        of what makes environmentalism so

                                        suggestions, I agree ;) While some will
                                        make valid arguments that this is just a
                                        way to wait around for technology to fix
                                        the problem for us with no personal
                                        sacrifice, amid all the

                                        perspective is at least more pleasant.

                                        out some other segment of population and
                                        blame them, when in fact you yourself
                                        are no better &#8230; only what you do
                                        must of course make sense
                                    </p>

                                        Replace your bulbs with CFL, or buy a
                                        Prius &#8230; heh another idiocy
                                        propagated by people like you. Are you
                                        aware that making the batteries for
                                        Prius does far more damage to the
                                        environment than a regular car in its
                                        entire lifetime? Are you aware that
                                        fluorescent light bulbs contain
                                        sufficient amount a mercury to be a
                                        health hazard? Companies push it because
                                        they are better for profit.

                                        Toothy: who the hell are you calling
                                        bullshit on? Why so many useless rants?
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        I guess I set a bad precedence by
                                        starting with a rant, though I put it in
                                        so as to demonstrate the uselessness of
                                        these rants. But even then I have to
                                        admit an underlying desire to simply
                                        rant. Rants are emotionally satisfying,
                                        I guess. Stupid, but satisfying.

                                    <p>Nice blog.</p>

                                    <p>
                                        &#8220;If I make some soccer-mom type
                                        feel guilty, will I have actually
                                        accomplished anything? I think she’s a
                                        stupid consumer, and probably
                                        self-centered in her choice, but do I
                                        actually want that person to feel bad,
                                        or mad, or unjustly accused?&#8221;
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        Not to worry, soccer-mom&#8217;s
                                        don&#8217;t feel guilt for long.
                                        Besides, they&#8217;d only go to the
                                        mall and buy something to assuage their
                                        guilt. :-)
                                    </p>

                                        At least you&#8217;re beginning to
                                        recognize that we live in a
                                        self-centered society with little regard
                                        for others whether they be people or
                                        nations. We&#8217;re mostly about
                                        meaningless gestures.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        We&#8217;re friendly with an
                                        acquaintance that changed all their
                                        incans to CFLs, but they leave their
                                        lights on all the time even when
                                        they&#8217;re not home&#8230;
                                    </p>

                                    <p>The assumption you make is below.</p>

                                    <p>
                                        &#8220;People want to do the right thing
                                        for the world. They want to stop global
                                        warming, they want to reduce pollution,
                                        save wildlife, all that stuff. All the
                                        surveys show this.&#8221;
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        What none of the surveys ask is whether
                                        people are prepared to make the
                                        sacrifices (mostly they&#8217;re not).
                                        What people do are make the gestures
                                        that make them feel good. They&#8217;re
                                        not willing to change lifestyle or
                                        comfort (however trivial it may seem).
                                        Guilt won&#8217;t do it. Has to be
                                        something to make them feel good.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        I&#8217;ve rented SUVs and quite
                                        frankly, I just don&#8217;t see the
                                        fascination with them. The family car
                                        works just fine. But then again, we
                                        don&#8217;t lead the same lifestyle.
                                        Most with SUVs around here are hauling
                                        boats &#8211; we don&#8217;t own one and
                                        are not interested. We&#8217;re a family
                                        of 5, but still see no need for an SUV,
                                        though we have been thinking of a
                                        minivan now that we drive home some
                                        neighbor&#8217;s kids from school in
                                        addition to our own.

                                        I&#8217;ve got two daughters and a
                                        centrally located job, but I still bike
                                        to work (when I can, and take transit
                                        the rest of the time). Do I count?
                                    </p>

                                        I think that if more people were more
                                        interested in living without cars, it
                                        would be easier to live without cars. Of
                                        course, I also think it&#8217;s easier
                                        than people think already. A while ago,
                                        I read a book about someone who sold his
                                        car, and made due without one (taking
                                        cabs sometimes, transit sometimes,
                                        biking or walking sometimes, etc). His
                                        main point seemed to be that when you
                                        have a car you drive a lot of places by
                                        default, without thinking about it, but
                                        when you don&#8217;t have a car you
                                        think about how you will get where you
                                        need to go, and sometimes the answer
                                        ends up being &#8220;by car&#8221;, but
                                        it&#8217;s the thought that goes into it
                                        that&#8217;s the important thing.

                                        Personal action doesn’t do anything, it

                                        I&#8217;ve always thought that personal
                                        action was the cornerstone of getting
                                        anything done. I don&#8217;t think that
                                        I&#8217;m going to single-handedly save
                                        the planet by using CFLs and biking to
                                        work, but I think that people might see
                                        me doing it, and that it&#8217;s
                                        important to me, and maybe consider
                                        doing it themselves, and perhaps people
                                        will see them, and maybe it could
                                        snowball until enough people are doing
                                        enough to have an effect (affect?
                                        effect?). Or maybe not. Maybe I&#8217;m
                                        not making any difference, and the world
                                        will go to hell. In that case, I guess I
                                        consider my lifestyle training for
                                        living in a world with $2000/barrel oil.

                                        The motivation for environmentalism is
                                        not subjective, the planet is so
                                        contaminated that our children are going
                                        to have a rough future and our
                                        grandchildren may not even have a
                                        future, and everything we do contributes
                                        to it.

                                        How we feel about it is subjective but
                                        the only sane responses to this fact are
                                        guilt, anger, fear and worry (or
                                        denial). There is no way around it. No
                                        we can&#8217;t turn this into a net

                                        machines that induce little orgasms
                                        every time you recycle or take public

                                        This is not the only movement that
                                        suffers from this, loosing weight,
                                        reading books, helping the starving in
                                        the third world, people often do nothing
                                        towards these goals because they get
                                        discouraged, there is always more to do
                                        but we all agree that that is no reason
                                        to do nothing.

                                        Actually I think <em>all</em> movements
                                        are based on negative feelings, if they
                                        weren&#8217;t, they would be hobbies, or
                                        sports. You don&#8217;t see a skydiving
                                        movement, you don&#8217;t see a home
                                        gardening movement.

                                        No sugar coating on the issue will stick
                                        long enough, in the end everything boils
                                        down to the fact that we need to do make
                                        unpleasing sacrifices for long time
                                        rewards that aren&#8217;t actually
                                        rewards but keeping what we already
                                        have, which is lame, I know.

                                        The key is of course in taking small
                                        steps forward, never backwards, and
                                        always pushing for more, what other way
                                        is there?

                                    <p>Ian, good to see you at PyCon.</p>

                                    <p>
                                        I read a book review that sounded
                                        similar to your sentiments (&#8220;how
                                        can we make this work?&#8221;); the
                                        authors were trying to put forward a
                                        &#8220;New Environmentalism&#8221; (my
                                        google-fu is weak, as those words are
                                        popular). The idea was that the
                                        &#8220;old&#8221; environmentalism had
                                        peaked with the public by hyping every
                                        new crisis as terminal for the last
                                        fifty years. The new movement was to be
                                        based on sober tradeoffs in risk and
                                        utility. For instance I have never, ever
                                        heard a person who hates SUVs extol the
                                        virtues of driving a manual
                                        transmission. Manual cars are cheaper to
                                        buy which reflects fewer resources in
                                        their production and are also more fuel
                                        efficient which reflects fewer resources
                                        in operation. No one has or will demand
                                        fleet standards for manual transmissions
                                        because it inconveniences the wrong
                                        people (the old and frail can&#8217;t
                                        drive manuals) or because sticks
                                        aren&#8217;t radical enough.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        The problem with existing
                                        environmentalists is that they come in
                                        two flavors: neither very helpful. First
                                        is the poseurs who drive Priuses and
                                        tsk-tsk their neighbors for not
                                        separating their recycling. I know
                                        several people of this type. One is a
                                        gal of modest means who spends endless
                                        time and water scrubbing her plastics
                                        and cans clean for recycling (if this
                                        can&#8217;t be inexpensive industrially
                                        than it is just expensive). I
                                        don&#8217;t know a Prius owner who is
                                        worth less than $10 Million. These folks
                                        consume fewer resources than Al Gore but
                                        not by much.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        Second are the hard core
                                        environmentalists, the ones always in
                                        high dudgeon in the media. They
                                        don&#8217;t try to make converts as much
                                        as they try to make heretics and
                                        apostates of everyone else. They
                                        don&#8217;t want anything less than to
                                        rule. Combine the hectoring and the
                                        abide-or-die and you have a very poor
                                        strategy for getting greens elected.
                                        Both hard greens and hard socialists
                                        demand absolute control in order to make
                                        their policies effective but the
                                        difference is that the socialists
                                        promise to benefit people. Green
                                        policies are about punishing and
                                        controlling said heretics and apostates;
                                        no one ever asks if we could build
                                        nuclear power plants to capture and
                                        sequester CO2. And nowhere do they
                                        mention the enormous American tradition
                                        of private conservation of lands.

                                        My lifestyle is quite tame but it
                                        doesn&#8217;t appeal to either the
                                        poseurs or the fascists. I drive a 10
                                        year old big Saab sedan that gets 30MPG.
                                        Three years ago when I bought it I could
                                        have spent $13k more to buy a Prius but
                                        there is no way I could put enough gas
                                        through the Prius before it died to
                                        justify the extra resources (adults
                                        measure resources in dollars). I buy
                                        local beer. I buy local veggies when
                                        they are in season &#8211; not because
                                        I&#8217;m green but because I&#8217;m a
                                        veggie snob (I unloaded veggie trucks as
                                        a teenager. Plus you local greens are
                                        both cheaper and tastier).
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        In closing there is nothing from any
                                        face of the environmentalist movement
                                        for me to like. Some people care about
                                        appearances and not results. The other
                                        set care about control and not results.

                                        About personnal action vs global action,
                                        I think that global actions won&#8217;t
                                        come without personnal action. There
                                        have to be pionneers, people who proves
                                        it can works, help determine good
                                        objectives before on can take more
                                        global move, and those pionners may
                                        continue even after as yeast in bread.
                                        Refactoring society is better than
                                        restarting from scratch. Of course that
                                        means that local change have to support
                                        the &#8220;be tolerant in what you
                                        receive, precise in what you give&#8221;
                                        :-)

                                        About guilt, I think we&#8217;d better
                                        try to bring people to consciense. This
                                        conscience may bring up some guilt, but
                                        this is more the consequence of previous
                                        behaviour.

                                        About &#8220;there&#8217;s alaways more
                                        to do&#8221;, you can have this problem
                                        with quite everythink in life, but as
                                        goes a french saying &#8220;the best is

                                        Why on earth does everyone accept this
                                        global warming nonsense without a single
                                        shred of ya know actual proof beyond
                                        computer models and 60 years of
                                        temperatures? There is no falsifiable
                                        evidence whatsoever that we are causing
                                        any change in temperatures. There are
                                        plenty of computer models, intersecting
                                        data(which isn&#8217;t causation) and
                                        hand-waving but no science behind any of
                                        it.

                                        Its fairly amazing hubris to believe
                                        that driving a car down the street will
                                        <em>destroy the planet</em>. I think
                                        Americans are watching too many movies.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        There is far more data to suggest that
                                        C02 increases due to heating up, not the
                                        other way around. That might explain why
                                        its getting warmer on Mars and there are
                                        no SUVs there.

                                        30 years ago it was global cooling, now
                                        the doom is global warming. Its all
                                        about control and nothing more.

                                        One picture I like is this. The earth is
                                        like a truck rapidly approaching a
                                        chasm. Environmentalists come in two
                                        flavours &#8211; those who attempt to
                                        hit the breaks as hard as possible, and
                                        those who try another approach, namely
                                        to &#8220;jam your foot on the pedal and
                                        see if you can just jump across&#8221;.
                                        I wholehartedly recommend [the
                                        article](<a

                                        Great point. Guilty does not lead anyone
                                        anywhere. I have my own way to take it,
                                        which works for me, but (unfortunately)
                                        is also very difficult for other people
                                        to follow. It&#8217;s based on three
                                        principles: efficiency, balance and
                                        pace.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        For me, the main reason to go the
                                        environmental way is the search for
                                        efficiency. Nature, despite all its
                                        redundancy and idiosyncrasies is
                                        surprisingly efficient. The universe is
                                        one big optimization machine. If I eat
                                        meat, and meat takes way more energy to
                                        be produced than it gives me, then
                                        it&#8217;s clearly inefficient. Can I do
                                        better eating veggies instead of meat?
                                        Probably. But I also need some meat, our
                                        bodies were built to use it too.
                                        That&#8217;s when balance comes into
                                        play.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        If you strive to live more efficiently,
                                        there&#8217;s always more to be done,
                                        but there&#8217;s no guilt about it.
                                        There&#8217;s always a challenge, and
                                        that&#8217;s motivating. But that
                                        challenge can be disheartening, if it
                                        seems to be impossible. To balance this
                                        continuous challenge, another principle
                                        is needed, and that&#8217;s how to pace
                                        your time. The universe is eternal.
                                        You&#8217;re not. You&#8217;ve got a
                                        finite time to live, and in this time,
                                        you&#8217;ve got to take one challenge
                                        at a time. So I may stop eating meat
                                        today, and stop driving a car for short
                                        distances tomorrow. The actual order and
                                        dates do not matter, what matter is the
                                        commitment for continuous improvement.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        That&#8217;s what I doing for the past
                                        few years. I still eat meat, and
                                        eventually I go to a barbecue party, but
                                        I reduced my daily consumption a lot. I
                                        own a small. I keep things such as
                                        aluminum, glass and paper separate from
                                        the organic trash, and give them to
                                        recycling folks from time to time (note:
                                        in Brazil some people make a living out
                                        of recycling). That&#8217;s working for
                                        me. It&#8217;s not about guilty,
                                        it&#8217;s about modesty, about being
                                        part of a world bigger than me, and
                                        trying to do my part as efficiently as
                                        possible&#8230; while still being me.
                                    </p>

                                        A huge factor in your experience is
                                        going to be the people in your life, and
                                        the choices they make. When you&#8217;re
                                        the only person you know who&#8217;s
                                        composting or biking everywhere, it
                                        would be weird not to be questioning
                                        your choices. But if your family,
                                        friends, and coworkers are more or less
                                        on the same wavelength, it&#8217;s just
                                        not as much of an issue.

                                    <p>
                                        Ian I had no trouble interpreting your
                                        post and I hate to sorely misplace
                                        contempt in anyone&#8217;s forum, but in
                                        this case I thought my contempt for
                                        environmentalism as a movement that is
                                        petrified by its fear of being a scold
                                        was a ready contrast to your view of it
                                        as being built upon guilt. (Maybe
                                        it&#8217;s built on guilt, but
                                        it&#8217;s &#8220;in denial&#8221;?) I
                                        suppose I hoped to accomplish the same
                                        thing anyone hopes to accomplish in
                                        posting words to the internet, to have
                                        one&#8217;s point heard, and I&#8217;m
                                        sorry that you have such a dim view of
                                        their effectiveness.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        You suggested my attitude proved your
                                        point, but to do that my opinions would
                                        have to be characteristic of mainstream
                                        environmentalism in the 70s, 80s, and
                                        90s. (Am I reading &#8220;built
                                        on&#8221; too literally?) I don&#8217;t
                                        even represent environmentalism of this
                                        decade, or call myself an
                                        environmentalist in the first place.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        The environmentalism that I have seen in
                                        inaction is built on empty promises,
                                        hopeful imagery of pandas and celebrity
                                        causes. It has steadfastly avoided
                                        criticism of individual
                                        decisions—guilt—and peddled a soft
                                        politics of awareness and fundraising.
                                        As this amounted to nothing, frustrated
                                        environmentalists formed their own
                                        harsher views outside the mainstream.
                                        The post you quoted suggests recruiting
                                        300 &#8220;environmentalists&#8221; to
                                        ceremonially dismantle an SUV. But I
                                        would counter that, if you selected 300
                                        Americans at random who called
                                        themselves environmentalists, very few
                                        of in this cross-section of the movement
                                        would be willing to participate in such
                                        barbary. (Thank goodness!)
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        Though environmentalism&#8217;s radical
                                        fringe has become more prominent, the
                                        message at the center of the movement
                                        has not budged. No changes is lifestyle
                                        will be required, just remember to turn
                                        off the lights when you leave and send
                                        in those Sierra Club dues. It&#8217;s
                                        not that I think advertising guilt would
                                        be effective: absolutely not. But there
                                        are ways to trasform &#8220;guilt&#8221;
                                        (recognition of the negative) into
                                        action. Unfortunately for
                                        environmentalism, the best tools for
                                        doing so are offensive to the socialism
                                        it finds itself intertwined with.
                                        Without those constraints you can
                                        promote conservation and make
                                        alternative energy competitive by
                                        pricing up negative impacts. You
                                        aren&#8217;t lamely asking people to
                                        feel guilty, you&#8217;re replacing
                                        guilt with a cost in dollars they will
                                        most definitely feel and act on.

                                        The Catholic Church (and lots of other
                                        churches coming from the Middle-East) is
                                        built on guilt. That worked quite well
                                        for 2000+ years. Every movement has to
                                        specify a set of rules, a way of
                                        discriminating between &#8220;us&#8221;
                                        and &#8220;them&#8221;, and if you break
                                        those rules you will feel guilty;
                                        open-source, for example, can make you
                                        feel guilty whenever you use Windows.
                                        That&#8217;s fine, that&#8217;s part of
                                        the game.

                                        The problem for environmentalism is
                                        another: whatever you choose to believe,
                                        the hard truth is that domestic
                                        consumption is the smallest factor of
                                        the equation, completely irrelevant for
                                        the scale of the problem. Driving a
                                        hybrid to work, using different
                                        lightbulbs and recycling all your
                                        domestic waste will not change anything
                                        at all, even if it&#8217;s done by
                                        everyone in the world. The only factor
                                        that matters is economic activity: your
                                        fleet of trucks, the ships bringing your
                                        products back and forth from Asia, the
                                        robots assemblying them, the hundreds of
                                        computers you turn on at least 8 hours a
                                        day to design them, the lights of your
                                        thousands of offices&#8230; Until you
                                        radically change this infrastructure,
                                        &#8220;talking green&#8221; is just a
                                        waste of time.

                                        I come to PyCon to be around optimists.

                                        ends up depressing. I think I&#8217;m

                                        It&#8217;s dull. Let&#8217;s talk about

                                        news. The fact is that the future holds
                                        a lot of risks, and a believable model
                                        of how we&#8217;re going to conduct
                                        ourselves under the new circumstances
                                        hasn&#8217;t emerged.

                                        be better off if everybody changed
                                        everything about themselves just
                                        isn&#8217;t realistic. I&#8217;m old
                                        enough that I&#8217;ve been through that
                                        one before. We really believed
                                        we&#8217;d change the world, rearrange
                                        the world. What ended up happening is
                                        our legacy is Starbucks, Apple,
                                        Dreamworks. All great stuff, all better
                                        than went before, but only mind
                                        changing, not world changing, pretty
                                        much world leaving exactly the same way
                                        it was before-ing actually.

                                        Unfortunately, the hour is getting very
                                        late and what we need might not be what
                                        we get. It might not even be possible.

                                        If we&#8217;re going to get out of this
                                        century intact the only way is through a
                                        huge shift in politics. Maybe that could
                                        be fun, but it&#8217;s hard to see it
                                        right now.

                                        I know this might put me in a minority,
                                        but I am skeptical that an SUV is the
                                        best target to enact environmental
                                        change. On one hand it is one of the
                                        easiest targets to attack though. I
                                        guess I more more worried about the same
                                        questions that Donald Knuth is worried
                                        about:

                                        I&#8217;ve found that MANY lefty or
                                        left-leaning orgs use guilt as their
                                        primary means of social engineering.
                                        It&#8217;s amazingly dumb. It just
                                        alienates people, or makes those who
                                        accept the dogma feel holier-than-thou
                                        towards everyone else, which guess-what?
                                        Alienates people even more.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        This is one of the big reasons that I
                                        adopted the Slow Food movement as worthy
                                        of my volunteer time: It&#8217;s not
                                        guilt based.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        They&#8217;re only nominally
                                        environmental (it&#8217;s a side effect
                                        of their core proposition) and
                                        aren&#8217;t transparently lefty (though
                                        the founder is a literal communist,
                                        politics are also not their core
                                        proposition). It&#8217;s a conservative
                                        manifesto with liberal secondary side
                                        effects. How cool is that?

                                        The basic gist of the movement is that
                                        EVERYONE deserves good food. Rich, poor,
                                        even you. And when you dig in and work
                                        out what &#8220;good&#8221; means, you
                                        find that all kinds of secondary effects
                                        that are really good for us, the planet,
                                        local economies, the future, our
                                        culture&#8230; all of these things
                                        happen by accident.

                                        And it&#8217;s not about &#8220;oh, I
                                        shouldn&#8217;t eat tuna &#8212; the
                                        dolphins&#8221; it&#8217;s about what I
                                        deserve. It&#8217;s about dignity and
                                        maybe entitlement&#8230; much better
                                        sales tools than guilt, IMO.

                                        It&#8217;s worse than that. Guilt driven
                                        enviornmentalism simply doesn&#8217;t
                                        work.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        For starters we are really really bad at
                                        judging the carbon cost of a product.
                                        Think of all this crap about buying
                                        locally grown. It makes sense that
                                        locally grown would use less carbon but
                                        it all depends. Actually shipping on
                                        giant ships or moving by train is so
                                        carbon efficient that they are easily
                                        outweighed by the short distances and
                                        other choices when less efficient means
                                        is used. Worse, we have no real
                                        intuitive handle on how much carbon is
                                        used to make a computer or to create a
                                        piece of wood furniture and corporations
                                        who want to sell us things have an
                                        incentive to mislead us into thinking
                                        their product is more enviornmentally
                                        friendly than it truly is.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        If this wasn&#8217;t bad enough consider
                                        the fact that by personally conserving
                                        you encourage someone else to pollute.
                                        Certainly in the short term (and perhaps
                                        now in the long term) gasoline has a
                                        fixed supply. Thus every gallon of gas I
                                        conserve lowers the price enough to
                                        convince someone else to use a gallon of
                                        gas. Even in the long term where in
                                        theory your conservation might encourage
                                        less future investment in refining and
                                        drilling you have to keep in mind that
                                        decreasing the demand for gas will still
                                        decrease the price and the other person
                                        who buys gas as a result will partially
                                        offset any conservation on your part.
                                        Worse, conservation as guilt encourages
                                        people to compare themselves to their
                                        neighbors and even useless acts that
                                        <em>feel</em> like they are saving CO2
                                        work against support for real solutions
                                        (I do my part why should I pay more
                                        too).

                                        Really though this shouldn&#8217;t
                                        bother us to much because the idea of
                                        environmentalism as personal
                                        conservation was a dumb one to begin
                                        with. It&#8217;s like responding to the
                                        fact that we would all like to own a
                                        porsche by deciding to have everyone
                                        conserve the time they spend driving a
                                        porsche so we can loan them out.
                                        Obviously driving a porsche or buying
                                        CO2 using products will be worth more to
                                        some than others and a better solution
                                        is to let those who get more benefit
                                        from it pay more for it and compensate
                                        the rest of us.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        The only thing that we can do to really
                                        combat global warming is actual taxes on
                                        CO2 use. I don&#8217;t get why some
                                        people seem to think it needs to involve
                                        personal sacrifice when really what it
                                        needs to involve is societal sacrifice
                                        in the form of taxes (which can be made
                                        revenue neutral to offset any potential
                                        shifts in the tax burden). It&#8217;s
                                        really not that hard but with two
                                        nominees for president proposing a gas
                                        tax holiday that every economist agrees
                                        will be useless I don&#8217;t have much
                                        hope.

                                        making a change is to have opinion
                                        leaders of each area set the precedent.
                                        Then promote this and back them up as
                                        much as possible.

                                    <p>
                                        The problem with your theory is that
                                        your actions affect me, my family, and
                                        my friends, and so I&#8217;m forced to
                                        care about the choices you make. :(
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        If we were all living in our own
                                        solitary environments, with no exchange
                                        beyond what we explicitly agreed to,
                                        then I would fully support your point of
                                        view, though.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        And, just to argue your side of things:
                                        Unless you live near me, it probably
                                        doesn&#8217;t affect me that much. And
                                        last I heard global warming will
                                        increase the amount of farmable land in
                                        Canada by 25% or so, so I guess I should
                                        really be asking you to drive your SUV
                                        more, since it will benefit me.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        (And yeah, as a Canadian, outlawing guns
                                        doesn&#8217;t seem that heinous to me.
                                        Feel free to dismiss the rest of my
                                        opinions based on that, if you want. ;)
                                    </p>

                                    <p>Later, Blake.</p>
