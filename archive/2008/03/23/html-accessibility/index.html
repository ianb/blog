                                    intention are the same. There are those
                                    people who feel they can separate the two,
                                    creating semantic markup that represents
                                    their intent, but they are so few that the
                                    <em>reader</em> can never trust that the
                                    distinction is intentional, and so

                                    Someone then yelled out something like

                                    argument being that screen readers would
                                    like to distinguish between the two, as not
                                    all things we render as italic would be read

                                    It&#8217;s not surprising to me that the
                                    first time I&#8217;ve gotten an actively
                                    negative reaction to a talk it was about
                                    accessibility. When having technical
                                    discussions it&#8217;s hard to get that
                                    heated up. Is Python or Ruby better? We can
                                    talk shit on the web, where all emotions get
                                    mixed up and weirded, but in person these
                                    discussions tend to be quite calm and
                                    reasonable.

                                    Discussions about accessibility, however,
                                    have strong moral undertones. This
                                    isn&#8217;t just What Tool Is Right For The
                                    Job. There is a kind of moral certainty to
                                    the argument that we should be making a
                                    world that is accessible to all people.

                                    I fear this moral certainty has led people
                                    self-righteously down unwise paths. They
                                    believe &#8212; with of course some
                                    justification &#8212; that the world must be
                                    <em>made</em> right. And so many
                                    boil-the-ocean proposals are made, and even
                                    become codified by standards, but
                                    <em>markup standards</em> are useless unless
                                    embodied in <em>actual content</em>, and
                                    this is where accessibility falls down.

                                    There are two posts that together have
                                    greatly eroded my trust in accessibility
                                    advocates, so that I feel like I am left
                                    adrift, unwilling to jump through the hoops
                                    accessibility advocates put up as I strongly
                                    suspect they are pointless.

                                    point, I would have deducted points for

                                    seemed to reinforce the belief that because
                                    it <em>should</em> work, that it

                                    article some, as it&#8217;s embedded in
                                    other wandering thoughts. In summary, JAWS
                                    is a horrible experience, and as an example
                                    it didn&#8217;t even understand paragraph
                                    breaks (where the reader would be expected
                                    to pause). What&#8217;s the point of
                                    semantic markup for accessibility when the
                                    most basic markup that is both presentation

                                        ><span class="pre">&lt;p&gt;</span></tt
                                    >) is ignored? Ian&#8217;s brief summary is
                                    that if you want to make your page readable
                                    in JAWS you&#8217;d do better by paying
                                    attention to punctuation (which does get
                                    read) than to markup. And if you want to
                                    help improve accessibility, blind people
                                    need a screen reader that isn&#8217;t crap.

                                    Months later we started talking a bit about
                                    the accessibility of
                                    <a
                                        class="reference external"

                                    >. Everyone wants to do the right thing, no?
                                    With my trust eroded, I argued strongly that
                                    we should only implement accessibility
                                    empirically, not based on &quot;best
                                    practices&quot;. Well, barring some patterns
                                    that seem very logical to me, like putting
                                    navigation textually at the bottom of the
                                    page, and other stuff that any
                                    self-respecting web developer does these
                                    days. But except for that, if we want to
                                    really consider accessibility we should get
                                    a tool and use it. But I don&#8217;t really
                                    know what that tool should be; JAWS is
                                    around $1000, all for what sounds like a
                                    piece of crap product. We could buy that,
                                    even though of course most web developers
                                    couldn&#8217;t possibly justify the
                                    purchase. But is that <em>really</em> the
                                    right choice? I don&#8217;t know. If we
                                    could detect something in the User-Agent
                                    string we could see what our users actually
                                    use. But I don&#8217;t think there&#8217;s
                                    information there. And I don&#8217;t know
                                    what people are using. Optimizing for screen
                                    magnifiers is much different that optimizing
                                    for screen readers.

                                    Another shortcut for accessibility &#8212; a
                                    shortcut I also distrust &#8212; is that to
                                    make a site accessible you make sure it
                                    works without Javascript. But don&#8217;t
                                    many screen readers work directly off
                                    browsers? Browsers implement Javascript. Do
                                    blind users turn Javascript off? I
                                    don&#8217;t know. If you use no-Javascript
                                    as a hint to make the site more accessible,
                                    you might just be wasting your effort.
                                </p>

                                    There&#8217;s also some weird perspective
                                    problems with accessibility. Blind users
                                    will always be a small portion of the
                                    population. It&#8217;s just unreasonable to
                                    expect sighted users to write to this small
                                    population. Relying on hidden hints in
                                    content to provide accessibility just
                                    <em>can&#8217;t work</em>. Hidden content
                                    will be broken, only visible content can be
                                    trusted. Admitting this does not mean giving
                                    up. As a sighted reader I do not expect the
                                    written and spoken word to be equivalent. I
                                    don&#8217;t think blind listeners lose
                                    anything by hearing something that is more a
                                    dialect specific to the computer translation
                                    of written text to spoken text. (Maybe
                                    treating text-to-speech as a translation
                                    effort would be more successful anyway?)
                                </p>

                                    A freely available screen reader probably
                                    would help a lot as well. I write my markup
                                    to render in browsers, not to render to a
                                    spec. Anything else is just bad practice. I
                                    can&#8217;t seriously write my markup for
                                    readers based on a spec.

                                        I don&#8217;t have the answers to your
                                        many questions about accessibility and
                                        the often poor support on different
                                        platforms, but I attended a presentation
                                        last year that I found enlightening:

                                        I&#8217;m a blind screen reader user,
                                        and try to keep my own web site as
                                        accessible as I can, whatever
                                        &#8216;accessible&#8217; means to any
                                        particular person.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        I don&#8217;t understand all the
                                        technicalities being discussed here, but
                                        maybe a few comments would be helpful.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        To me, a good web page is just a
                                        well-structured page, with content that
                                        I actually want to read. Get the
                                        structure right and most other things
                                        will follow.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        I visited a friend&#8217;s site because
                                        he wanted accessibility comments. It was
                                        great &#8211; the screen reader told me
                                        everything I needed to know, and it did
                                        it without any glitches.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        But when I ran the code through an HTML
                                        validator, the validator moaned about
                                        various supposed accessibility problems.
                                        These amounted to stylistic niceties.
                                        The id attribute for some of the
                                        paragraphs wasn&#8217;t explicit enough.
                                        Well, big deal, who cares? It
                                        didn&#8217;t stop the page reading fine.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        It&#8217;s hard to imagine anyone
                                        getting heated over the longdesc tag.
                                        Don&#8217;t use it, is all I&#8217;d
                                        say. Use succinct alt tags instead and
                                        nobody needs to break their brains
                                        trying to make graphics accessible. Alt
                                        tages being absent altogether can be a
                                        major problem, however, if you&#8217;re
                                        expected to hit buttons that just look
                                        like a series of blobs &#8211; something
                                        you often come across on the Web, and in
                                        desktop programs, for that matter.

                                        There are freely available screen
                                        readers, and some are getting very good.

                                        is possibly the best of these. It is
                                        fairly JAWS-like in some ways, but costs

                                        these screen readers, but whatever
                                        floats your boat&#8230; It does seem to
                                        go down well with less expert computer
                                        users.

                                        What do blind people actually use? Well,
                                        moot point. Most don&#8217;t use
                                        anything, and don&#8217;t go near
                                        computers, which are too alien to deal
                                        with. At the other end of the market,
                                        the elite of screen reader users are
                                        relatively well catered for, not least
                                        because many get access tech paid for so
                                        they can do a job, and get subsidies
                                        from Governement agencies. That&#8217;s
                                        the only reason that things like JAWS
                                        can exist. The point, though, is that
                                        accessibility has been pretty much
                                        formulated for screen reader users, and
                                        other people with disabilities
                                        don&#8217;t get anything like so much of
                                        the action. I have an axe to grind as a
                                        once partially sighted computer user.
                                        Then there are dyslexics, colourblind
                                        people, those with minimal dexterity,
                                        deaf people and on and on, who also
                                        deserve a slice of the cake. But in the
                                        end, so long as web designers
                                        don&#8217;t put up unnecessary barriers,
                                        they won&#8217;t cause any of those
                                        people too much grief.

                                        Less well known, and cheaper, screen
                                        readers are Window Eyes, Hal, and
                                        Serotek System Access (paid version).
                                        Although JAWS is the well-known one, it
                                        doesn&#8217;t seem to rule the place
                                        like it used to. Every screen reader has
                                        its advocates, but then, once
                                        you&#8217;d paid up and mastered all
                                        those dastardly 4-finger keystrokes,
                                        you&#8217;d better believe you&#8217;re
                                        using something really good! At the
                                        moment, it seems that the jury&#8217;s
                                        out on which screen reader will prevail
                                        longer term.

                                    <p>
                                        I can&#8217;t believe JAWS cam&#8217;t
                                        recognise paragraph markup! NVDA does it
                                        fine, but you need to spend a minute
                                        setting up the config so that it does
                                        it. JAWS, I understand, has a jungle of
                                        verbosity settings, and with enough
                                        fiddling about, I&#8217;m sure it can be
                                        made to treat the markup of pages in
                                        many different ways.

                                        Worth mentioning that JAWS and the
                                        others I mention are confined to the
                                        Windows platform. Voiceover on the Mac
                                        is now a serious contender, not least
                                        because it&#8217;s included in the price
                                        of the computer. Then there&#8217;s
                                        Linux&#8230;&#8230;..

                                        Quick mention of CSS &#8211; a great way
                                        for sighted people to have their eye
                                        candy and for blind people to eat it
                                        too.

                                        I don&#8217;t like the sound of a
                                        separate layer for blind people. I
                                        don&#8217;t know what it means
                                        technically anyway, but let&#8217;s stay
                                        mainstream, please.

                                        To your point about freely available
                                        screen readers, I can testify that the
                                        screen reader built into Mac OS X is
                                        very usable, and I&#8217;m told
                                        there&#8217;s screen reader
                                        infrastructure built into Windows XP.

                                    <p>
                                        I&#8217;m all for empirical testing of
                                        the accessibility of web pages, but I
                                        suspect you&#8217;ll find that after you
                                        play with the screen reader on a
                                        representative sample of code,
                                        you&#8217;ll gain an intuition on what
                                        works and what doesn&#8217;t very
                                        quickly, and will use the software less
                                        over time.

                                        Screen readers do indeed execute
                                        JavaScript (or rather run on top of
                                        browser DOM trees that have already
                                        executed it for them) &#8211; they have
                                        to, or a huge number of sites would be
                                        completely useless. That doesn&#8217;t
                                        mean that unobtrusive scripting
                                        can&#8217;t help with accessibility
                                        though. The principle accessibility
                                        problem facing heavy JavaScript sites
                                        today is that there&#8217;s no reliable
                                        hook for telling a screen reader
                                        &#8220;that part of the page was just
                                        dynamically updated&#8221;. If you
                                        submit a form by Ajax and then refresh
                                        the contents of a div with a thankyou, a
                                        screen reader user won&#8217;t hear
                                        anything &#8211; they&#8217;ll have to
                                        manually rescan the entire page to
                                        figure out what just happened.

                                        With unobtrusive scripting, you can
                                        provide an &#8220;accessible
                                        version&#8221; which is actually just
                                        the regular site but with all of the
                                        window.onload style handlers disabled. A
                                        simple checkbox (hidden off screen with
                                        CSS if you like) which sets a cookie and

                                        Hey Ian, I was a bit surprised by your
                                        heckler but you seemed to perk up, as if
                                        challenged. If it were me I doubt
                                        I&#8217;d be able to handle it so
                                        smoothly. Good job ;) PyCon isn&#8217;t
                                        well suited to having a
                                        &#8220;discussion&#8221; during a talk
                                        but, then again, that may or may not
                                        have been useful.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        There was an important message I got
                                        from your talk that deserves mention:
                                        the web is filled with bad HTML and we
                                        are stuck with it, so let&#8217;s learn
                                        to deal with it instead of despise it.
                                        Accessibility purists have a hard to
                                        time coming to terms with this.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        On a personal note, I am highly grateful
                                        for your work on lxml.html because it
                                        has been the only reliable way for me to
                                        apply xpaths to ebay HTML descriptions
                                        (for a project where I want to analyze
                                        thousands of auctions). Anyone who is
                                        familiar with the site knows these
                                        descriptions are created by sellers and
                                        quality wise are on par with geocities
                                        markup. Yet for my purposes contain
                                        information I want to parse and there is
                                        nothing I can do about their abuse of
                                        HTML. So, thanks!
                                    </p>

                                        gave NVDA a try, though only with
                                        limited success. It seemed to have
                                        performance issues that caused it to
                                        delay for long periods of time with no
                                        feedback, or start reading something
                                        that had moved from the screen a while
                                        ago. It ended up swallowing keys from
                                        the right-hand side of the keyboard,
                                        even though its speech claimed to be
                                        typing those keys. Luckily I at least
                                        was able to see the page to realize this
                                        was happening. I tried a couple times to
                                        navigate with the screen turned off, but
                                        it was quite unsuccessful.
                                    </p>

                                        Another issue I had was with links,
                                        which sometimes NVDA would read out in
                                        full (the href &#8212; a long, tedious,
                                        and unhelpful link). I don&#8217;t know
                                        why it chose to do that sometimes and
                                        not other times. There seem to be a
                                        number of toggles which I imagine
                                        you&#8217;d turn on or off depending on
                                        the page. But you have to be familiar
                                        with the tool to know what to do when.

                                        In the end I got [a couple ideas](<a
                                            href="http://www.openplans.org/projects/opencore/blog/2008/03/24/accessibility-on-our-site/"

                                        >) of small things we could improve, but
                                        only small things. Actually getting into
                                        the site revealed problems with NVDA
                                        that I didn&#8217;t know how to get
                                        past. I&#8217;ll be giving some other
                                        tools a try as well.
