                                        I know next to nothing about the
                                        specific problems the Ruby and Python
                                        folks are encountering with
                                        &quot;monkeypatching&quot;. However this
                                        capability is nothing new for dynamic
                                        languages. And it is a frequent desire
                                        for me when I program in C-like
                                        languages. If you become frustrated
                                        using static &quot;utility&quot;
                                        methods, for example in Java, that work
                                        with &quot;closed&quot; classes (say,
                                        String or Object), then you have at
                                        least some desire for these
                                        &quot;monkeypatches&quot;.

                                        See the thing is this capability
                                        <em>is</em> a cool feature in many Lisp
                                        and most Smalltalk systems. Sorry, dear
                                        readers who hate my Smug Lisp Weeniness.
                                        But it is true. Not only is it
                                        &quot;cool,&quot; moreover it is
                                        <em>pragmatic</em>.

                                        The truly good implementations of
                                        dynamic languages recognize the
                                        advantages of these kinds of extensions,
                                        and they&#8217;ve supported them with
                                        good tools for decades. Learn from it,
                                        don&#8217;t run from it.

                                    Sharp tools are good. I would not want
                                    monkeypatching removed from Python. Still,
                                    it&#8217;s best not to leave sharp tools
                                    lying around. It&#8217;s best not to mix
                                    your butter knives with your steak knives. I
                                    don&#8217;t resent the safety guards on
                                    circular saws.

                                    And sorry Lisp Weenies: your experiences are
                                    not so novel anymore. The Python community
                                    isn&#8217;t new to this dynamic typing
                                    thing. We&#8217;ve taken some hits and
                                    we&#8217;ve learned from them. And frankly
                                    the problems with runtime patching of
                                    methods can&#8217;t be specific to Python or
                                    Ruby. It only took the Ruby community a
                                    couple years to start

                                    programmers still haven&#8217;t figured this
                                    out? Everything you value about modularity
                                    is at risk when you monkeypatch code. That
                                    risk can be worth it, of course! But do you
                                    really need me to explain the benefits of
                                    modularity? What&#8217;s next, a recap of
                                    the problems with GOTO?

                                    One of the things that I think distinguishes
                                    Python among the popular dynamically typed
                                    languages of the day, is that it&#8217;s
                                    built &#8212; languages and libraries
                                    &#8212; on a great deal of concrete
                                    experience. Experience
                                    <em>about developing with Python</em>. There
                                    was a time when people tended to define
                                    Python as a delta from Java or Perl or C. We
                                    don&#8217;t need to do that anymore. Sure,
                                    closed classes in Java suck. Python
                                    isn&#8217;t a reaction to Java&#8217;s
                                    suckiness. That we can do something Java
                                    can&#8217;t doesn&#8217;t get me excited.
                                    This feature of monkeypatching has to stand
                                    up on its own, and while sometimes its use
                                    is justified those cases are few and far
                                    between. That&#8217;s what we&#8217;ve
                                    learned: monkeypatching was not dismissed
                                    out of hand, it was not dismissed because of
                                    anything in Java, it was dismissed because
                                    people <em>used</em> it without
                                    acknowledging it as a hack, and it
                                    <em>sucked</em>.

                                    Of course the use cases are still there.
                                    Which is why people

                                    to address these problems. One benefit of
                                    experience is that you know some paths are
                                    dead ends. We still haven&#8217;t figured
                                    out The One Right Path (and

                                    the longest path in a very long dead end in
                                    this maze of ideas we are traversing. Since
                                    I doubt the maze has any exit (nirvana?)
                                    it&#8217;s a valid debate about where we are
                                    trying to get at all. That said, I suspect
                                    we&#8217;ve out-explored Lisp. Lisp has been
                                    a worthy mentor, an intrepid explorer in his
                                    time, but he&#8217;s old and doesn&#8217;t
                                    get out much and only tells stories of where
                                    he&#8217;s been in the past. There are still
                                    things to be learned there, wisdom to be dug
                                    out of that environment, but Lisp and Python
                                    are not peers.

                                        I do not know python, i probably should.
                                        (It does not have lisps powerful macros
                                        does it?) But this sentence is a
                                        non-argument: &#8220;Lisp [...] only
                                        tells stories of where he’s been in the
                                        past.&#8221;
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        Lisp is still here. Did all those
                                        features that were in the story
                                        disappear yesterday? Of course
                                        pro-lispers repeat the same arguments,
                                        its the same language..
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        Frankly common lisp needs more ease of
                                        use in producing (portable) binaries and
                                        such. Maybe it need to allow uppercase
                                        in (normal) symbols, and a function that
                                        includes directly from other languages.
                                        It would be awesome if (#include
                                        &#8216;SDL.h) would translate all the
                                        functions in the straightforward way.
                                        (But not at all straightforward to
                                        implement AFAIK.) Also more direct
                                        useage of pointers would be nice.(and
                                        dangerous) Also something about lisp is
                                        that i dont get set, setf, setq exactly,
                                        very annoyingly it sometimes does and
                                        sometimes doesnt work if i setf an
                                        argument of a function. (I do not want
                                        to be functional in every case.)

                                        Well, I find it amusing when the LISP
                                        evangelists come down from the
                                        functional-programming heavens to smack
                                        us down with smugness.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        You can say your programming language is
                                        the best in the world 10^89, and still
                                        don&#8217;t convince me, unless you show
                                        me why should I use it instead of
                                        Haskell, OCaml, or any of the other
                                        functional languages with saner (and
                                        more maintainable) syntax and broader
                                        library utility. Some let you program
                                        your own tools, and some let you have a
                                        functional web server in 10 lines or
                                        less. The former are OK while in the
                                        Academia, but when I work I want to use
                                        the latter.
                                    </p>

                                        Thing is, as Ian points out, LISP is
                                        stagnant. Smalltalk used to be, but with
                                        the new Squeak platform, you could argue
                                        it&#8217;s coming back to life. But
                                        LISP? Bless them&#8230;

                                        Ian, you&#8217;re missing the point with
                                        regard to monkey patching and Lisp.

                                        In CLOS, code does not belong to classes
                                        (only the data), so by defining new
                                        methods on generic functions, or
                                        extending them (:before/:after/:around),
                                        you don&#8217;t really hit that problem.

                                        Jasper, Why would you want to setf the
                                        argument to a function? Maybe what you
                                        /really/ want to do is something like
                                        this?
                                    </p>

                                    <pre><code>(defun foo (bar baz)
  (let ((quux (1+ bar)))
    (format t "Yay, new value for bar: ~A" quux)))
</code></pre>

                                    <p>
                                        On the other hand, if you really want to
                                        use setf then by all means, go ahead!
                                        Stupid example follows (key point being
                                        the LET form).
                                    </p>

                                    <pre><code>;; CL is a Lisp-2, so variables can have the same names
;; as functions without collision (!untested code!)
(defun length (list)
 (let ((length 0))
   (dolist (e list)
     (incf length)) ; (setf length (1+ length)) or (setf length (+ 1 length)) if you really feel like it.
   length))
</code></pre>

                                    <p>
                                        LET is useful for introducing local
                                        variables. Do you often change the value
                                        of arguments to functions in other
                                        languages, too?
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        You need to properly understand how
                                        functions are applied to arguments if
                                        you want to be able to SETF them. (All
                                        arguments are evaluated, unless quoted).
                                        So, what happens if you do this?
                                    </p>

                                    <pre><code>(defun add (a b)
  (setf a (+ a b)))

(setf foo 10)
(add foo 5)

(format t "New value of foo: ~A" foo)
</code></pre>

                                    <p>
                                        Exactly, you&#8217;ll get the same value
                                        as before the call to add. Symbols are
                                        just names for the location of an
                                        object, not the object itself.
                                    </p>

                                        Yes, that&#8217;s the definition of
                                        functional programming.
                                        <em>Pure</em> functional languages like
                                        Haskell respect that, and use monads for
                                        I/O. LISP, on the other hand, is kind of
                                        a mixed beast, more powerful if you
                                        will, but with shortcomings nonetheless.
                                        Actually, my main complaints about LISP
                                        are:
                                    </p>

                                    <ul>
                                        <li>
                                            <p>
                                                Horrible syntax: maybe not for
                                                the initiated, but pretty grim
                                                for everyone else. Why, oh why,
                                                do I need 5 pairs of brackets
                                                just to define a function?
                                                Haskell does the same without
                                                the bracket-tax.

                                                Dozens of implementations,
                                                roughly 50% of them commercial,
                                                most of them diverging little or
                                                nothing, and none of them a
                                                default &#8216;reference
                                                implementation&#8217; (or at
                                                least herd-driver). LISP is in
                                                the same state COBOL, Pascal and
                                                Basic were 20 years ago.
                                                It&#8217;s a chaotic situation,
                                                and every other LIPS hacker
                                                seems to think

                                                It&#8217;s a niche language.
                                                Yes, I know there are X or Y or

                                                still is a niche. In a way the
                                                LISP community is very similar
                                                to the Assembly community,
                                                gathering around particular
                                                implementations (read NASM,
                                                FASM, etc.) and trying to tackle
                                                the problem of creating full
                                                applications with the

                                                want?). Which drives me to the
                                                last point:

                                                LISP is powerful, but not
                                                empowering: LISP lets you jump
                                                through 1000 hoops, but how well
                                                does that translate to everyday
                                                programming? I&#8217;ve yet to
                                                see a single big

                                                done in LISP. That shows a
                                                tendency: people tend to use
                                                whatever makes them productive,
                                                not whatever makes their
                                                programs theoretically perfect.
                                                I

                                        my initial post was full of smugness
                                        itself. I&#8217;m sorry for that. But I
                                        hope this will help the hardcore LISP
                                        evangelists out there realise why we,
                                        the mere code-crunching mortals, stay
                                        away from LISP, Smalltalk, and any other
                                        such Academic languages.

                                        Ian, you seem to have misread
                                        Patrick&#8217;s quote above.
                                    </p>

                                        support a tool but a feature. The
                                        &#8216;tools&#8217; he is referring to
                                        is that your code editors show you where
                                        these patches are applied in no
                                        uncertain terms and that you can query
                                        the system as to which modules have been
                                        patched and which modules do the
                                        patching etc. etc.
                                    </p>

                                        In the case of VisualWorks Smalltalk
                                        this means that in the browsers patched
                                        methods are shown in red instead of
                                        black and that various queries and
                                        operations on the patches are provided.

                                        I&#8217;m not quite sure I follow you on
                                        the &#8220;mixed beast&#8221; part
                                        &#8212; you mean a language
                                        <em>has</em> to choose whether to
                                        support object-oriented, functional,
                                        logical, declarative or $paradigm
                                        programming?
                                    </p>

                                    <p>Adressing your issues:</p>

                                    <p><strong>Syntax.</strong></p>

                                        Cool, I&#8217;ll give you that.
                                        It&#8217;s the price you pay to treat
                                        code and data uniformly, and being able
                                        to have macros. Still, it&#8217;s very
                                        much like Python&#8217;s significant
                                        whitespaces: you&#8217;ll love it in the
                                        end. Macros is a powerful language
                                        feature that enables you to keep the
                                        boilerplate code down to a minimum by
                                        adapting the language to your problem
                                        domain. Moreover, because of the
                                        regularity of language-defined functions
                                        (e.g. &#8216;if&#8217;), adding your own
                                        flavor of &#8216;if&#8217; that
                                        additionally performs extra code will
                                        not stand out.

                                        My favourite example is the addition of
                                        the keyword WITH in Python-2.5,
                                        though&#8230; (Hint: how many PEPs has
                                        to be written, parsers modified and
                                        releases rolled out to support that in
                                        Lisp?)

                                        Yes, you are correct. There are many
                                        implementations of Common Lisp, instead
                                        of the one true reference design.
                                        Instead, the language is a proper ANSI
                                        standard, and defined by X3J11, or the
                                        HyperSpec. Just ask the PyPy and the
                                        Jython people how fun it is to correctly
                                        mimic bugs in CPython (i.e., the
                                        canonical Python) in order for code
                                        running in their implementations to work
                                        correctly.

                                        Common Lisp is a large language. You
                                        can, of course, do much in it without
                                        learning it all. But, you still need to
                                        swallow a piece that probably feels
                                        larger than the C-like languages. Much
                                        of that feeling comes from&#8211;at
                                        least, it did for me&#8211;the fact that
                                        you&#8217;re not quite sure that if you
                                        start using these constructs, are you
                                        perhaps missing out on something
                                        that&#8217;s even more efficient? In the
                                        end, all that matters is to actually
                                        start hacking. You&#8217;ll uncover more
                                        of the language by hand.

                                        Reinout: I noticed the tool aspect,
                                        though admittedly I didn&#8217;t really
                                        reply to it. Perhaps this is because I
                                        don&#8217;t rely on many tools for my
                                        development.

                                        I think there is a lot in Smalltalk
                                        particularly, but also in Common Lisp,
                                        that is not transferable to an open
                                        source environment. When you buy a
                                        system and libraries and then develop on
                                        top of it and keep what you develop
                                        internal, you can do development where
                                        you are hacking around the system. Then
                                        you can build tools to make it
                                        manageable. But when you are creating
                                        reusable libraries that are being made
                                        public, released, and combined by
                                        different people in different ways, I
                                        don&#8217;t think the process works.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        I also kind of talked about Lisp,
                                        because it&#8217;s clearer to me that
                                        there&#8217;s not a whole lot of ideas
                                        to mine from there. Some, just not a
                                        whole lot. Smalltalk probably has more
                                        stuff left in it. Though I do think
                                        Smalltalk has a core structure that is
                                        just incompatible with open source
                                        development. Making an IDE a core part
                                        of the environment is part of this
                                        &#8212; and part of what makes the
                                        tooling for this feature possible. But
                                        that&#8217;s another substantial topic
                                        of its own.

                                    <p>Ian,</p>

                                    <p>
                                        As the author of the (excellent!) ORM
                                        SqlObject, you should know what it means
                                        for productivity to work in a higher
                                        abstraction level: Python instead of raw
                                        SQL. Now, imagine being able to abstract
                                        the actual syntax of the language away,
                                        and move even closer to your problem
                                        domain.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        A good example of this is the
                                        (define-binary-class &#8230;) macro
                                        Peter Seibel (in the book Practical
                                        Common Lisp) creates for his ID3-parser.
                                        You essentially define a bunch of
                                        classes and functions, automatically, by
                                        just defining the layout of the binary
                                        file. Enter a bunch of clever macros
                                        which then fill the rest out for you.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        Even though you might not actually start
                                        using Lisp, I strongly suggest you read
                                        Practical Common Lisp, as I believe it
                                        will make you see a lot of things in a
                                        new light. (It did to me, and I&#8217;ve
                                        written my fair share of Python,
                                        including a commercial TurboGears-based
                                        deployment, attended EuroPython and been
                                        quite the Python advocate.)

                                        You seem to be saying
                                        &#8216;monkeypatching&#8217; is a
                                        problem in CL, and that we haven&#8217;t
                                        figured it out. You think we
                                        haven&#8217;t figured it out ? Look at
                                        emacs! (elisp is a lisp, just as CL is a
                                        lisp, scheme is a lisp, and python,
                                        believe it or not, is widely considered
                                        a lisp by the lisp community).
                                        It&#8217;s the oldest example, and
                                        it&#8217;s used as the example of the
                                        right way to do it in the
                                        &#8216;monkeypatching is ruining
                                        ruby&#8217; article you mention. (Lets
                                        forget, for a moment, that elisp is
                                        dynamically scoped :) ). No sane lisp
                                        programmer would
                                        &#8216;monkeypatch&#8217; something and
                                        expect other things not to break. A sane
                                        api for extending functionality of
                                        pre-existing libraries (like the hook
                                        approach in emacs) is the way to go.

                                        In your older article you linked, you
                                        wrote that you don’t consider Perl a
                                        high-level language, merely a dynamic
                                        one, and that all it’s really about is
                                        regular expressions. Do you still hold
                                        that view? If so, can you give me any
                                        example of an abstraction that Python
                                        can facilitate [but Perl cannot](<a

                                        Well, maybe I should soften some of my
                                        statements. I see 3 general reasons for
                                        monkeypatching:
                                    </p>

                                    <ol>
                                        <li>
                                            <p>
                                                Something is simply missing from
                                                an API. An example in Javascript
                                                is that
                                                <code>Array.push</code>
                                                isn&#8217;t defined in some
                                                versions of IE, and some
                                                libraries monkeypatch it in.
                                            </p>
                                        </li>
                                        <li>
                                            <p>
                                                You want to add new
                                                functionality, completely
                                                separate from other
                                                functionality. Monkeypatching
                                                might be most aesthetically
                                                pleasing (i.e., a method instead
                                                of a function).

                                                functionality.

                                    <p>
                                        In the case of 1, it&#8217;s usually
                                        fine: you are ideally simply improving
                                        the situation. Of course it depends on
                                        the correctness of your confidence: if
                                        it is not completely self-evident how
                                        the missing feature should be added,
                                        other people are likely to add it in
                                        slightly different ways and conflicts
                                        will happen. I think a naivety in among
                                        Rails developers has led them to write a
                                        lot of code believing they are in case
                                        1, when really they are in case 2.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        In the case of 2 &#8212; I suspect the
                                        most common case in Smalltalk &#8212; it
                                        is fine at first. But you have to worry
                                        about naming conflicts, and some
                                        behavior &#8212; like fallback behavior
                                        for classes you didn&#8217;t know about
                                        when you constructed the patch &#8212;
                                        is only implicit, based on the
                                        inheritance structure. This works fine
                                        when you are working with code that is
                                        centrally developed (except for your own
                                        code). When there is a community of
                                        developers sharing code I don&#8217;t
                                        think it works.
                                    </p>

                                        However, Generic functions in Common
                                        Lisp solve both problems with case 2
                                        well: fallback behavior is very clear,
                                        and each function is independent and in
                                        its own namespace, and located in a way
                                        that makes it clear who is responsible
                                        for the function.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        In the case of 3 it&#8217;s quite
                                        dangerous. I don&#8217;t see how generic
                                        functions make it any less dangerous.
                                    </p>

                                        So yes, I agree that CLOS is an
                                        important and interesting system worth
                                        looking into, and generic functions are
                                        a notable alternative to methods for
                                        object-oriented programming. OTOH, CLOS
                                        isn&#8217;t getting any
                                        <em>more</em> interesting over time.

                                        Now, as to something like Clojure:
                                        perhaps another parallel I could have
                                        made in the [article I linked to](<a

                                        just as substantial as intrinsic typing
                                        and source typing. Here I&#8217;m not
                                        sure what the procedural languages can
                                        do: either we&#8217;ve chosen the right
                                        path, or we haven&#8217;t. I don&#8217;t
                                        know if knowledge can cross over that
                                        easily, just as there&#8217;s whole
                                        practices of code for dynamic languages
                                        that don&#8217;t really cross over well
                                        to statically typed languages.

                                    <p>
                                        Aristotle: regular expressions were only
                                        an example, of course, not a summary of
                                        Perl. I think Perl sags badly under the
                                        weight of Very Bad Decisions, like
                                        references. A language without well
                                        behaved nested data structures is just
                                        silly. Of course you <em>can</em> write
                                        all kinds of high-level stuff with Perl.
                                        You can do so with C too. I don&#8217;t
                                        say that <em>just</em> sarcastically, as
                                        people <em>have</em> made complex
                                        dynamic systems with C. (Maybe
                                        it&#8217;s unfair to lump Perl with the
                                        much-less-expressive PHP.)

                                    <p>
                                        The &#8220;high level&#8221; in Python
                                        that I&#8217;m trying to refer to
                                        isn&#8217;t really that high. Not crazy
                                        programming techniques, just high enough
                                        that you can safely trust that all the
                                        basics of programs &#8212; functions,
                                        conditionals, loops &#8212; work safely
                                        and well, and you can focus on the stuff
                                        that is more challenging. So I would
                                        argue that low level abstraction
                                        problems in Perl are more concerning
                                        than the ability to do highly abstract
                                        code. Once you start using closures and
                                        metaclasses and other things you have to
                                        watch what you are doing, in either
                                        language. But I feel much safer doing
                                        these high level things when I know the
                                        low level stuff is robust. Perl
                                        hasn&#8217;t made it robust.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        There might be a point when even these
                                        high-level abstractions are robust. For
                                        instance, I&#8217;d feel more
                                        comfortable with closures if they could
                                        be introspected better. That the state
                                        in a closer is just inferred (at least
                                        in Python) makes it an awkward
                                        abstraction. We move up by small steps,
                                        and &#8220;high-level&#8221; and
                                        &#8220;low-level&#8221; is really just a
                                        way of placing language on a spectrum
                                        specific to
                                        <em>this current time</em> in
                                        development. I would certainly hope that
                                        the high level of today becomes the low
                                        level of tomorrow.

                                        I know the Python party line about
                                        anonymous functions is &#8220;Why would
                                        you ever want to do that?&#8221;, and I
                                        know the workaround for read-only
                                        closed-over variables is to use an
                                        aggregate, but I find the irony
                                        particularly delicious when a Python
                                        programmer complains that Perl
                                        doesn&#8217;t have robust &#8220;low
                                        level stuff&#8221; with regard to
                                        closures and metaclasses.

                                        Perl 5 seem to me to stem from
                                        autoflattening in list context, which is
                                        a deliberate design decision.
                                        They&#8217;re an improvement over nested
                                        structures in Perl 4, but they&#8217;re

                                        chromatic: by low level stuff, I meant
                                        stuff like decent function signatures
                                        and nested data structures. Perl&#8217;s
                                        data structures are indefensibly awful.
                                        I spend most of my programming time
                                        fiddling with data structures, not doing
                                        metaprogramming. Even if Perl&#8217;s
                                        metaprogramming facilities were better
                                        than Python&#8217;s (maybe they are, I
                                        don&#8217;t know), so long as its
                                        <em>basic</em> programming facilities
                                        are so flawed it hardly matters.

                                        been discussing so far are called
                                        primary methods. Primary methods, as
                                        their name suggests, are responsible for
                                        providing the primary implementation of
                                        a generic function. The standard method
                                        combination also supports three kinds of
                                        auxiliary methods: :before, :after, and
                                        :around methods. An auxiliary method
                                        definition is written with DEFMETHOD
                                        like a primary method but with a method
                                        qualifier, which names the type of
                                        method, between the name of the method
                                        and the parameter list.

                                        Auxiliary methods are just a convenient
                                        way to express certain common patterns
                                        more concisely and concretely. They
                                        don&#8217;t actually allow you to do
                                        anything you couldn&#8217;t do by
                                        combining primary methods with diligent
                                        adherence to a few coding conventions
                                        and some extra typing. Perhaps their
                                        biggest benefit is that they provide a
                                        uniform framework for extending generic
                                        functions. Often a library will define a
                                        generic function and provide a default
                                        primary method, allowing users of the
                                        library to customize its behavior by
                                        defining appropriate auxiliary
                                        methods.&#8221;"&#8221;

                                        Mikael: I see the extension of generic
                                        methods, at least in the safe
                                        non-monkeypatchy way, and using
                                        before/after/around, as more like
                                        subclassing and overriding methods.
                                        Monkeypatched code has the same
                                        patterns, though they aren&#8217;t
                                        explicitly named.

                                    <p>Ian,</p>

                                    <p>You are correct.</p>

                                    <p>
                                        In fact, monkey patching isn&#8217;t
                                        necessary in Common Lisp, because
                                        of/thanks to multiple dispatch (which
                                        follows from methods not belonging to
                                        classes, i.e. the reason for having to
                                        monkey patch).
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        It seems the problem doesn&#8217;t
                                        happen at all. I wonder what similar
                                        issues happen in Lisp?

                                        Mikael Jansson: &#8220;As the author of
                                        the (excellent!) ORM SqlObject, you
                                        should know what it means for
                                        productivity to work in a higher
                                        abstraction level: Python instead of raw
                                        SQL. Now, imagine being able to abstract
                                        the actual syntax of the language away,
                                        and move even closer to your problem
                                        domain.&#8221;
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        Who says SQL isn&#8217;t the right
                                        abstraction level for many problems?
                                        Maybe the average &#8220;CRUD&#8221;
                                        application benefits from things like
                                        SQLObject, but the most significant
                                        complaint about most ORM solutions is
                                        how they reinvent SQL badly in the
                                        solution developer&#8217;s language of
                                        choice, and how you have to jump through
                                        hoops to write something that may be
                                        difficult in SQL, but which is natural
                                        in that language. I&#8217;ve done a fair
                                        amount of work with relatively large
                                        databases of late and I can&#8217;t see
                                        how hiding the database system (and its
                                        very useful query analysis tools) would
                                        have been beneficial.

                                        &#8220;A good example of this is the
                                        (define-binary-class …) macro Peter
                                        Seibel (in the book Practical Common
                                        Lisp) creates for his ID3-parser. You
                                        essentially define a bunch of classes
                                        and functions, automatically, by just
                                        defining the layout of the binary file.
                                        Enter a bunch of clever macros which
                                        then fill the rest out for you.

                                        I think declarative structure parsing is
                                        very nice, and there are solutions like
                                        this in Python.

                                        actually start using Lisp, I strongly
                                        suggest you read Practical Common Lisp,
                                        as I believe it will make you see a lot
                                        of things in a new light. (It did to me,
                                        and I’ve written my fair share of
                                        Python, including a commercial
                                        TurboGears-based deployment, attended
                                        EuroPython and been quite the Python

                                        Expanding on the SQLObject reference:
                                        certainly SQLObject uses a number of
                                        metaprogramming techniques, and
                                        especially when it was written quite a
                                        few of those techniques were very novel.
                                        I am glad I had those new features (in
                                        Python 2.2) to aid in that development.
                                        But I also know that, in retrospect,
                                        many of the techniques I used, I
                                        wouldn&#8217;t use if rewriting it. Of
                                        course I still would use many of those
                                        techniques, and it&#8217;s hard to know
                                        ahead of time which will work well, and
                                        when they will work well.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        This is really what I&#8217;m referring
                                        to: the <em>wise</em> use of advanced
                                        features is essential. Python, Common
                                        Lisp, Ruby, etc, all give programmers
                                        the ability to create very clever and
                                        unmaintainable code. I wouldn&#8217;t
                                        blame any one feature for this either
                                        &#8212; for instance,
                                        <code>eval</code> is very dangerous, but
                                        I certainly wouldn&#8217;t remove it.
                                        Runtime patching of code is similar. Or,
                                        to give an example from SQLObject, I do
                                        operator overloading there in a
                                        particularly peculiar way, using
                                        operators to build expressions instead
                                        of calculate expressions.
                                        <em>Generally</em> I would say
                                        that&#8217;s a dangerously clever
                                        technique. <em>Specifically</em> for
                                        that problem (constructing SQL
                                        expressions) I think it works well.
                                        Experience and experimentation is
                                        generally the best guide for figuring
                                        this out. But that experience
                                        doesn&#8217;t have to be entirely
                                        personal; the community has experience
                                        and can offer important guidance.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        As an example in Ruby and Python,
                                        community experience will come down on
                                        anyone using <code>eval</code> for
                                        anything that doesn&#8217;t
                                        <em>absolutely</em> require
                                        <code>eval</code>. In Ruby it still is
                                        seen as a valid metaprogramming
                                        technique. I don&#8217;t know the Common
                                        Lisp community well enough to know what
                                        community convention accepts and avoids,
                                        but I&#8217;m sure there as in any
                                        community there are particular
                                        standards.

                                        My gut feeling is that eval is used
                                        because there is no proper support in
                                        the language to achieve whatever
                                        you&#8217;re trying to do with the code
                                        passed on to eval.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        Generally, you don&#8217;t want to use
                                        eval in Common Lisp, but among newbies
                                        it&#8217;s common to think it should be
                                        used in many places where you should do
                                        it in another, easier &amp; cleaner way.
                                        Have a look at

                                        eval&#8221;) for more info.

                                        Same thing goes for macros: newbies tend
                                        to think of them as working like their
                                        crippled relatives in the C world, and
                                        as such use them as a way to inline
                                        code. With strange results. :)
