                                    should a person choose between these
                                    options?

                                    First, the LGPL. It has specific phrasing
                                    that makes some sense for C code, to
                                    distinguish between extending the library
                                    itself and using the library. It
                                    doesn&#8217;t make much sense for other
                                    runtime environments. Some people have tried
                                    to
                                    <a

                                    >, but I&#8217;m not sure if a clarification
                                    like that means much. The ambiguity seems
                                    like the worst of all worlds. People who are
                                    afraid of the GPL won&#8217;t use the
                                    software anyway. People who act in bad faith
                                    can satisfy the terms of the license through
                                    trickery. You don&#8217;t get any practical
                                    protection over a permissive license, and
                                    you get most of the stigma of the GPL. The
                                    GPL has some success stories, places where
                                    source was actually released due to the
                                    terms of the license. I don&#8217;t know of
                                    any similar success stories for the LGPL. If
                                    you don&#8217;t want to use the GPL, just
                                    use a permissive license.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Then the question: GPL or permissive
                                    licensing?
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    For some time I&#8217;ve chosen a permissive
                                    license for my code. But I&#8217;m not
                                    really advocating that, and every so often I
                                    throw out a little GPL code. Underneath this
                                    is something of a disinterest in licensing.
                                    I don&#8217;t think it means much. If
                                    specifics of your license matters then
                                    something has gone wrong. People are
                                    leeching code, and/or the community
                                    isn&#8217;t providing enough benefit to
                                    encourage participation. I don&#8217;t
                                    believe that software has much intrinsic
                                    worth, and treating it like property
                                    doesn&#8217;t make that much sense to me.
                                    Licensing treats software as property, which
                                    is why I see the relevance of licensing as a
                                    kind of disfunction. But there is the
                                    outside chance that it&#8217;s really just a
                                    big project, or that the project is being
                                    participated in by rivals. But nothing I
                                    work with is like this, and it&#8217;s
                                    pretty uncommon generally, and anyway those
                                    projects all have their licensing pretty
                                    much figured out.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    The GPL does seem to serve a constructive
                                    purpose when rivals have to cooperate in
                                    some fashion. It makes a kind of
                                    demilitarized zone where everyone has to
                                    work for the collective good. But even this
                                    is a sign that you can&#8217;t trust the
                                    participants. This is somewhat reasonable,
                                    because you can&#8217;t actually trust large
                                    corporations with faceless programmers
                                    working on the code. But even that&#8217;s a
                                    kind of disfunction, because you can at
                                    least kind of trust large corporations with
                                    programmer employees who have a public face.
                                    The individual programmers are going to be
                                    very uncomfortable participating in any kind
                                    of Machiavellian conspiracy. Good open
                                    source projects are a coming together of
                                    individuals. Institutions are not effective
                                    participants. There are however scaling
                                    issues with individual participation:
                                    particularly that only a minority of
                                    developers are actually inclined to
                                    participate in this way. An institution can
                                    pay someone to work on something they
                                    don&#8217;t care very deeply about, and that
                                    person can still do useful work. But they
                                    won&#8217;t be part of the community.

                                    Outside of this mediation of rivalries
                                    I&#8217;m not really sure what the GPL
                                    provides. It protects users, because the
                                    terms of the GPL ensure that users get code.
                                    It doesn&#8217;t actually ensure that code
                                    is made public, though it does give
                                    developer employees leverage to make their
                                    work public. There&#8217;s some urban
                                    legends about the viral aspect of the GPL,
                                    but that&#8217;s really just bullshit. Code
                                    doesn&#8217;t magically get relicensed just
                                    because there&#8217;s a little GPL in the
                                    mix. The GPL police won&#8217;t show up at
                                    your door and confiscate your computers. The
                                    only people who make those claims are
                                    GPL-haters like Microsoft. Who should you
                                    trust: the FSF or Microsoft? If you answered
                                    &quot;Microsoft&quot; then you need to get
                                    your head screwed on straight.

                                    Unfortunately there is a stigma about the
                                    GPL, and there are competent developers that
                                    avoid all GPL software. I find this
                                    frustrating, especially since I don&#8217;t
                                    actually care about licensing, and so this
                                    adds a point of contention that I
                                    don&#8217;t really care to pay attention to.
                                    Some people in this situation then become
                                    GPL haters, because they feel like
                                    it&#8217;s all GPL&#8217;s fault. But the
                                    GPL didn&#8217;t create the licensing
                                    situation &#8212; proprietary software
                                    started this. Direct your hate where it
                                    belongs. The GPL ain&#8217;t it.

                                    If my libraries were GPL I doubt I could
                                    leverage that to make other people open
                                    source their code. But I know I would
                                    alienate some people, and as a result I
                                    choose a permissive license because
                                    it&#8217;s just strategically advantageous.
                                </p>

                                    Applications I think are different
                                    strategically. You don&#8217;t just swap an
                                    application in and out like you might a
                                    library. If you choose to use an
                                    application, then often the licensing is a
                                    secondary choice. The licensing ultimately
                                    only really applies to extensions. Libraries
                                    also have a different pattern of acceptance.
                                    Stubborn GPL haters can in effect veto a
                                    library in many projects (this is because
                                    stubborn GPL haters are viral). But in an
                                    application their influence is much smaller.
                                    Developers concerns like architecture and
                                    choice of libraries are not what drives an
                                    application. An application is driven by its
                                    functionality. If you have a useful
                                    application then licensing tends to be a
                                    secondary concern. The licensing tends to
                                    define the community in some sense as well,
                                    and as a result there&#8217;s a kind of
                                    opt-in consensus. And I think the GPL in
                                    these cases really does create an
                                    environment of collaboration around
                                    extensions. It has a real benefit.

                                    This seems to be true empirically as well.
                                    GPL&#8217;d libraries don&#8217;t tend to
                                    get very popular. People will do

                                    just because of licensing issues.
                                    GPL&#8217;d Applications seem to do quite
                                    well, with examples like WordPress, Plone,
                                    The Gimp, and even the Linux kernel, which
                                    is closer in structure to an application
                                    than a library.
                                </p>

                                    I haven&#8217;t studied the GPL v3 very
                                    closely, but it seems useful to me.
                                    Software-as-a-service has the potential to
                                    make the GPL irrelevant (especially for the
                                    kind of code I write), and could put the GPL
                                    in the same category as the LGPL where it
                                    retains its stigma without offering any
                                    practical advantages. Version 3 makes the
                                    permission/GPL choice seem useful, but so
                                    far I&#8217;ve never made any truly
                                    conscious choice between version 2 and 3.

                                    If you are thinking about choosing a
                                    license, or thinking about choosing software
                                    based on the licensing, maybe these thoughts
                                    will be helpful in your own thinking. And
                                    please don&#8217;t GPL-hate in the comments,
                                    I&#8217;m not interested and if you feel the
                                    need then go write your own post.

                                    <p>
                                        Yesterday I happened to relicense some
                                        code from GPL to BSD, in response to a
                                        colleague who wondered whether my
                                        potential clients might have issues with
                                        some restrictions in the GPL. I realized
                                        that I didn&#8217;t quite understand GPL
                                        enough to know whether that was a
                                        problem, so I switched the trunk (I left
                                        the older branch as GPL).
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        I understand that there are legal issues
                                        and legal issues are complicated, but to
                                        me the biggest problem with the GPL was
                                        that in 20 minutes of reading up I
                                        couldn&#8217;t find the answer to my
                                        friend&#8217;s question. Permissive
                                        licensing lets me get on with my life.

                                        Is there any viable alternative to the
                                        LGPL for runtimes like Python? I like
                                        that it prevents someone from totally
                                        hijacking my work*, but I agree that it
                                        and the GPL are very C-specific (which
                                        is sensible and good for the kind of
                                        code the FSF ordinarily writes).

                                        Joseph: there&#8217;s definitely lots of
                                        libraries that do fine with the LGPL.
                                        But I don&#8217;t think they would do
                                        any differently under a permissive
                                        license. There are some GPL success
                                        stories, like gcc Objective C support,
                                        where the GPL actually got someone to
                                        open source something that they
                                        wouldn&#8217;t have open sourced
                                        otherwise. I don&#8217;t know of any
                                        cases like that with the LGPL.

                                        Dan: I think a permissive license in
                                        practice works fine. There&#8217;s just
                                        not much incentive to hijack
                                        people&#8217;s work.

                                        If you take the software as a service to
                                        the extreme, you end up with a thin
                                        client that can still run GPLv3 code.
                                        This might be quite effective because
                                        then you own your local machine and all
                                        the code on it [that implements the
                                        client]; perhaps the FSF could declare
                                        victory at this point. You would still
                                        need the GPL to protect this new state
                                        of affairs.

                                        I have a little bit of an issue with
                                        this part of your article: I respect the
                                        GPL, so I will never use software
                                        licensed under it in circumstances where
                                        I (or my employer) possibly can&#8217;t
                                        or don&#8217;t want to fulfill
                                        it&#8217;s license terms &#8211; no
                                        matter if anybody will show up to
                                        complain or get us to court or
                                        something.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        It&#8217;s just a matter of
                                        &#8220;respecting the terms of whoever
                                        wrote the stuff&#8221;. I live in a
                                        country where practically no case of
                                        pirated comercial software is ever
                                        prosecuted or found out. Doesn&#8217;t
                                        make me use pirated software myself. I
                                        hate M$ and most comercial crapware as
                                        much as the next guy, but if they chose
                                        to distribute it on those terms, I
                                        prefer to stay away.

                                        a hard time to compete against my free
                                        version.

                                        Ids: That is true for the US and
                                        probably many other states but for
                                        example in Germany that is not possible.
                                        Germany laws don&#8217;t allow you do
                                        send things of to the public domain (as
                                        in kinda letting go your author&#8217;s
                                        rights). You will always keep the rights
                                        as the author. Of course you can decide
                                        not to enforce any restrictions and
                                        whatnot, ut you cannot just give your
                                        stuff to the public legally. It&#8217;s
                                        just a tiny legal detail but the tiny
                                        legal details are what often makes
                                        things difficult when looking at
                                        licenses.

                                        The GPL has served as a wonderful tool
                                        due mainly to the fact that it was born
                                        in a time when the FLOSS community was
                                        both A) more idealistic and B) active
                                        mostly in building the foundations of
                                        todays Open Source software (Most
                                        notably GNU/Linux, GCC and the libraries
                                        we&#8217;ve all been using ever since).
                                        The viral nature of the GPL was the
                                        principle disciplinarian in keeping free
                                        software free and has resulted in a
                                        wonderful and diverse toolset and
                                        foundation without which our community
                                        would be much the poorer today.

                                        Having said that; the world needs a new
                                        antivirus.

                                        The GPL was born of an idealism and zeal
                                        of a brand that few other than Stallman
                                        still hold. FLOSS has evolved into a
                                        rich, varied and diverse world where
                                        community development and commercial
                                        interests have proven to coexist
                                        peacefully and with a good degree of
                                        cross-pollination. For every Microsoft
                                        or SCO there&#8217;s a Sun, an IBM or a
                                        Redhat; large (often monolithic)
                                        corporations that are passed the proving
                                        stage in their dedication to Open Source
                                        (even if for their own financial
                                        interests). The GPL now serves more as a
                                        hindrance to greater adoption of Open
                                        Source due to (rightfully) GPL-allergic
                                        developers and to some degree
                                        enterprises. I was of the strong opinion
                                        that GPLv3 should have forked in two
                                        directions, one more restrictive and one
                                        more permissive but that proved to be
                                        beyond the FSF&#8217;s self-imposed
                                        mandate. Fair enough.
                                    </p>

                                        Nowadays I&#8217;m in favor of the
                                        Apache license because it causes a very
                                        different kind of virality. Rather than
                                        the license going viral it is actually
                                        the code that does so because developers
                                        can feel free to reuse it for almost any
                                        use while I get to retain the ownership.
                                        Seems win/win to me but others may
                                        disagree and go the X/BSD/MIT/Mozilla
                                        route and still get many of the same
                                        benefits.

                                    <p>
                                        I am one of those who never really reads
                                        the license. Not so far ago I started
                                        writing stuff and eventually releasing
                                        bits of it, and all of sudden I needed
                                        (?) to apply some license to it. Since I
                                        am a fanatical linux user, I went with
                                        GPL. For no other reason. But then,
                                        it&#8217;s mostly hobby stuff, and
                                        I&#8217;m happy enough if someone out
                                        there finds it useful. After reading
                                        this, I might reconsider releasing my
                                        stuff under GPL and might take it over
                                        to the BSD end. Power (and code) to the
                                        people.

                                        I kinda like the spirit of the GPL
                                        (including its viral nature &#8211; it
                                        has a definite purpose), and I applied
                                        it to my first few hobby projects. But
                                        it&#8217;s just too long and scary.
                                        People don&#8217;t even read the average
                                        EULA, let alone 11 pages (in the case of
                                        GPL v2). Besides, my recent projects
                                        have been very small, and I think
                                        it&#8217;s ridiculous to have a license
                                        text longer than the actual source code.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        What to use, then? Well, at 20 lines,
                                        the MIT license has much better chances
                                        to actually get read and understood by
                                        people, and can be easily included in
                                        full at the top of every source file.
                                        The BSD license has similar qualities
                                        &#8211; it&#8217;s a matter of taste as
                                        far as I can tell &#8211; and for one
                                        project I even adopted the [Mu

                                        which, I think, makes for a great moral
                                        statement, though it&#8217;s probably
                                        worthless as legal protection. Or
                                        precisely because of that?

                                        GPL is fine for python programs, the
                                        restrictions are pretty much
                                        non-existent for a a couple of reasons.
                                        1. Python applications and libraries are
                                        generally source code anyways. 2. Code
                                        is evaluated at runtime vs. compiled
                                        into a binary.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        Making your source available is the norm
                                        in python world, and you can freely mix
                                        licenses due to the fact that the files
                                        are kept separate.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        However for C/C++ programs the situation
                                        is quite different. If you include
                                        headers of any GPL&#8217;ed libraries,
                                        the preprocessor effectively writes
                                        gpl&#8217;ed code into the top of your
                                        source code. Therefore, you have to
                                        license your code as GPL, which is why
                                        LGPL exists. My big problem with this is
                                        simply, I want to have the choice of my
                                        own license with an app and have a big
                                        issue with being forced to use someone
                                        elses license.

                                        secrets.
                                    </p>

                                        As an example, someone expressed concern
                                        that maybe a build tool I was working on
                                        might be GPL, and then they
                                        wouldn&#8217;t want to use it. This
                                        wasn&#8217;t based on any rational
                                        reason, as there&#8217;s nothing
                                        particularly proprietary about how
                                        people use build tools. And build tools
                                        should be open source simply out of
                                        respect to the people deploying the
                                        software, who might need to debug your
                                        code.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        If you build a proprietary application
                                        with a GPL&#8217;d tool, that
                                        doesn&#8217;t extend the GPL to your
                                        application, and no one is trying to
                                        assert that kind of control over other
                                        people&#8217;s code. At least no open
                                        source developers &#8212; this does come
                                        up from time to time in proprietary
                                        development, but as I said, if you are
                                        looking for someone to distrust
                                        it&#8217;s the proprietary environments
                                        that deserve it.
                                    </p>

                                        Another unfounded fear is that a little
                                        GPL code will have a viral effect on a
                                        proprietary codebase. This fear is also
                                        unfounded. If you accidentally include
                                        some GPL code in some section of your
                                        application you&#8217;ll have the
                                        opportunity to just remove it,
                                        reimplement it, no one is going to
                                        relicense your code without your
                                        permission because of that. I say this
                                        not as a lawyer, but because this is
                                        what happens in practice. There simply
                                        aren&#8217;t cases of the GPL being
                                        viral like this, except when GPL code
                                        forms a substantial portion of the
                                        codebase in question. In all cases GPL
                                        licensing issues have been resolved
                                        through negotiation, not through court
                                        cases.

                                        People make a hard line about the GPL
                                        that is totally unjustified, and
                                        that&#8217;s what bothers me. Mostly I
                                        think it&#8217;s either based on
                                        ignorance or it&#8217;s part of a hidden
                                        ideological agenda. Or it&#8217;s stupid
                                        legal departments that want to assert
                                        their importance by being
                                        obstructionist. Well, that and a
                                        tendency of programmers to make specious
                                        logical arguments about the law, because
                                        programmers tend to think that the law
                                        is based on logic instead of reason.

                                        the KDE community and gained a bit of

                                        be the one of &#8220;how can I build a
                                        business on my self written
                                        applications?&#8221; For some of my
                                        projects I have chosen to go with
                                        &#8220;Dual Licensing&#8221;. That means
                                        that I use GPL for a public version and
                                        a proprietary license I sell for
                                        commercial users. In this case I have
                                        the feeling that the GPL protects the
                                        code to not be stolen by another person
                                        who tries to use my intellectual
                                        property for a very similar commercial
                                        projects. But on the other hand I have
                                        the feeling that with the GPL it is
                                        possible for other people to start a new
                                        <em>free</em> project if they like to
                                        and that is alright for me.

                                        How do you think about these things?
                                        Sorry for the indiscreet question, but
                                        Ian how do you finance the work on your
                                        wonderful software projects?

                                        Par: I think it&#8217;s important to
                                        think about what a realistic outcome
                                        will be. If you want to build a business
                                        you should think about what kind of
                                        business you are building. If it&#8217;s
                                        providing a desktop application, then I
                                        don&#8217;t know&#8230; but that&#8217;s
                                        not a very common business to go into
                                        these days. If it&#8217;s providing a
                                        web-based application, then a lot of the
                                        value you provide will be in terms of
                                        hosting, the reliability of your
                                        service, customer service, etc.
                                        Especially if you are providing a niche
                                        service, will the code itself be of much
                                        value to your customers? You probably
                                        don&#8217;t have to worry about another
                                        person like yourself coming along and
                                        using your code to take your business. I
                                        haven&#8217;t really seen that happen.
                                        The primary competition you&#8217;ll
                                        have is from your customer&#8217;s IT
                                        people. The GPL doesn&#8217;t really
                                        matter in that situation.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        If you are thinking about providing
                                        consulting, then the primary way to
                                        build your business with software is to
                                        get the software popular. If the
                                        software is popular and respected, you
                                        might be able to get consulting gigs to
                                        extend it, or more likely it will be a
                                        way of building business associations
                                        and justifying a higher rate. You can
                                        also basically charge for
                                        &#8220;solutions&#8221;, where you
                                        charge based on the value of the work to
                                        the customer, not on the amount of work
                                        you put in. This is kind of what
                                        licensing fees are meant to do, but the
                                        customer probably doesn&#8217;t care
                                        about that. So long as you are charging
                                        a competitive rate and providing good
                                        value, the justification for your rate
                                        is less important. Consulting companies
                                        around Plone tend to work like this.
                                        It&#8217;s up to you to invest in your
                                        own infrastructure &#8212; and
                                        it&#8217;s an investment, as it&#8217;ll
                                        be a resource sink to start, and might
                                        pay off later if your software
                                        infrastructure really does help you do
                                        development.

                                        There&#8217;s a small number of
                                        companies that make monkey with
                                        extensible GPL software where they sell
                                        a proprietary-compatible license. It
                                        never seems to work all that well, and
                                        for many domains I don&#8217;t see how
                                        it would work at all.

                                        So&#8230; those are my general thoughts.
                                        I don&#8217;t think licensing factors in
                                        that much.

                                        now an FSF license released shortly
                                        after GPLv3, which deals with the
                                        &#8220;Software As A Service&#8221;
                                        issue. I hope you&#8217;ll consider it

                                        irrelevant because of
                                        software-as-a-service. Be sure to check
                                        out the Affero GPL (AGPL), a copyleft
                                        license specifically designed to address
                                        that issue.

                                        I think the Ogre 3D Rending Engine is a
                                        LGPL success story. Many people
                                        contribute back, and no one is screwing
                                        the author in the engines usage.
