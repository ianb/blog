                                    amount of democracy, because there are no

                                    any kingdom they like. Well, at least among
                                    the open source kingdoms. Without
                                    citizenship, and with no exclusiveness of
                                    ownership, with even property having largely
                                    disappeared, I suppose it&#8217;s inevitable
                                    that traditional metaphors of control and
                                    governance don&#8217;t really make sense.

                                        Ian it is funny you mention this,
                                        because as I was working with App Engine
                                        this past weekend I thought to myself,
                                        now why do I need a framework someone
                                        else wrote, especially for App Engine,
                                        WSGI, and Datastore? I might choose to
                                        use something another person wrote, like
                                        I did with Django templates, but only if
                                        it makes sense to me in that situation.
                                        I guess I am too alpha male to buy into
                                        anything wholesale, and follow a
                                        &#8220;philosophy&#8221; or plan I
                                        didn&#8217;t completely understand, or
                                        play a role in creating.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        I dislike the idea that I am supposed to
                                        follow some form of leader, or package,
                                        who has my best interest in mind, and
                                        thought of what I may need to write for
                                        me. How does anyone know what I need
                                        ahead of time? I like libraries, they
                                        save a lot of work and they are cool,
                                        but frameworks are just not my thing. Of
                                        course I am very stubborn, and it pisses
                                        a lot of people off too :)

                                        &#8220;&#8230;To ask nothing. To expect

                                        something better came along. In a

                                        I think Pylons or Zope 3 actually seem
                                        to suit Noah&#8217;s self-described
                                        temperament the best. These systems
                                        explicitly give you a toolbox of
                                        libraries and leave a lot of flexibility
                                        into the hands of people who want to use
                                        the toolbox. The drawback is that the
                                        individual developer also needs to do a
                                        bit more integration to figure out which
                                        components in the toolbox they should
                                        use, and how.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        Something like Django, Grok or
                                        TurboGears aim to offer a more
                                        integrated experience. The advantage is
                                        that more works out of the box without
                                        research by the individual developer,
                                        but the drawback is that it may be
                                        harder to swap in new components and
                                        less flexibility. Django aims to give
                                        this experience by building its own
                                        integrated stack. This is similar to the
                                        traditional Zope 2 project (which has
                                        changed quite a lot over the last few
                                        years). TurboGears did this by
                                        integrating a set of existing
                                        components, and now with TurboGears 2,
                                        by offering a more integrated experience
                                        on top of Pylons components. Grok
                                        already had that mission for Zope 3
                                        components (and other things).
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        Grok&#8217;s approach has an interesting
                                        aspect. We mostly build on existing Zope
                                        3 components so far, though certainly
                                        not exclusively so. These components
                                        have integration and plugin points using
                                        the component architecture, and they all
                                        tend to share a style. This helps us
                                        present an integrated feel while still
                                        retaining the toolbox
                                        (&#8220;megaframework&#8221;) aspect. We
                                        try to retain Zope 3&#8242;s flexibility
                                        while adding a more integrated feel: the
                                        best of both worlds.

                                        The best way in my own personal
                                        experience to do new things that people
                                        seem to like to use is to actually build
                                        on things that already exist.
                                        &#8220;Things&#8221; here means both
                                        communities, APIs and codebases. Five
                                        was all about Zope 3 in Zope 2. lxml on
                                        libxml2 and using ElementTree&#8217;s
                                        API. Grok on Zope 3. This process still
                                        involves invention, but the aim is to
                                        invent the least amount necessary to
                                        accomplish the main aim of the project.
                                        Five: the flexibility of Zope 3 in
                                        production Zope 2 sites. lxml: an easier
                                        API to expose libxml2&#8242;s power,
                                        Grok: taming Zope 3&#8242;s power. The
                                        trick when doing new things is to use
                                        existing things as much as possible, so
                                        there are less new bits to worry about.
                                        So there is a way for Noah to start his
                                        revolutions without succumbing to NIH.

                                    <p>To respond to Ian, Martijn, and Mike,</p>

                                    <p>
                                        I actually like a lot of the tools that
                                        Mike and Ian have created, I use them
                                        quite a bit. In fact, I am very grateful
                                        for them in fact. I am working on a
                                        &#8220;secret&#8221; project using
                                        SQLAchemy right now in fact, and I use
                                        virtualenv everyday. In terms of Pylons
                                        and Ben, I like this Routes idea, and I
                                        will probably use it at some point soon
                                        for another project I am doing.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        Those tools don&#8217;t preach to me
                                        though, or tell me what I am supposed to
                                        do. As my skills develop in my journey
                                        through Python, I realize I don&#8217;t
                                        like philosophical ideals, like
                                        frameworks, but I like tools. Anything
                                        that smells of religion, or wants me to
                                        join a club, or wear a T-Shirt, or make
                                        decisions for me, I dislike immediately.
                                        Of course, I am somewhat influenced by
                                        objectivism, and am agnostic, and am
                                        really stubborn, so I am sure that
                                        bleeds into other areas as well.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        One thing I have enjoyed about doing
                                        very small things in Grok, and lurking a
                                        lot on the list, is that I am learning
                                        quite a bit about Python and Web
                                        Development, thanks in a large part to
                                        Martijn. I also like that Grok, like
                                        Pylons, is very flexible, and people
                                        aren&#8217;t shoving some philosophy or
                                        architecture down my throat, or even
                                        suggesting I am stupid if I don&#8217;t
                                        use their way of doing things. I also
                                        like that Grok has support for ZODB, and
                                        SQLAlchemy, while having this huge pile
                                        of Zope 3 code I could start
                                        experimenting with as I learn more.
                                        Finally, after meeting a Neuroscientist
                                        guru at Caltech that changed my life, I
                                        have obtained a great deal of respect
                                        for my elders and as such, I really
                                        respect the Zope people, like Jim Fulton
                                        and Martijn. In fact, I want to take the
                                        time to learn what they know, they are a
                                        pot of gold. I would classify this as
                                        the opposite of NIH actually.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        All that being said, I like to
                                        experiment and question things, so if
                                        something doesn&#8217;t make sense, I am
                                        not afraid to ask why. This really
                                        pisses a lot of people off, including my
                                        friends at times. In terms of the
                                        current state of Google App Engine for
                                        example, I really don&#8217;t get what a
                                        framework buys me. I think I can write a
                                        killer application, which I am doing
                                        btw, that doesn&#8217;t use a framework
                                        other than perhaps the default webapp
                                        minimal framework.

                                        to look at and pick up idioms from. If

                                        to look at. The governing and
                                        dick-waving doesn&#8217;t really matter
                                        if you stand face-to-face with the
                                        source.
                                    </p>

                                        Fubar/I am sorry you don&#8217;t have
                                        the courage to reveal your true identity
                                        in a blog post, but from a guess you
                                        seem to like to use the word
                                        &#8220;folk&#8217;s&#8221;, and
                                        &#8220;dick-waving&#8221;, with a hyphen
                                        no less&#8230;gee&#8230;I wonder who
                                        this could be? I guess you about
                                        summarized your method of operation,
                                        personal attack, to make your point,
                                        anonymously. What is next, are you going
                                        to hide behind a bush at the next PyCon
                                        2009 and throw rocks at me?
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        I have been studying web frameworks in
                                        Python for the last 2 years quite
                                        heavily, this includes Pylons, Zope,
                                        Zope 3, Grok, Django, web.py, and I
                                        don&#8217;t like Django for every
                                        situation, but I do for some, like the
                                        appengine application where I used the
                                        Django templates recently. I also
                                        don&#8217;t believe in the idea that you
                                        need to have a web framework to write a
                                        web application in every situation. I
                                        also do not like a tightly configured
                                        set of components in all situations, I
                                        like freedom. Finally, I don&#8217;t
                                        need a leader, or want what you are
                                        peddling, sorry, give the next guy in
                                        the airport the flower&#8230;
                                    </p>

                                        &#8220;Feudal&#8221; is stretching it.
                                        Pylons and its components are mostly
                                        one-man shows: the project leader writes
                                        the vast majority of code himself.
                                        Pylons is feudal in the sense that Ben
                                        cedes a lot of design authority that
                                        dictators wouldn&#8217;t: he&#8217;ll do
                                        what others want unless he thinks
                                        it&#8217;s really bad.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        But the relationship between the
                                        projects is not feudal: there&#8217;s no
                                        emperor over them. Each project leader
                                        is sovereign; none owes anything to the
                                        others. The code has technical
                                        interdependencies, but that&#8217;s not
                                        feudalism any more than a restaurant and
                                        its suppliers are feudal. WSGI-org-onia
                                        is both a treaty organization and a
                                        marketplace: Pylons shops for
                                        components, and all parties make
                                        interoperability agreements. You saw
                                        that at the inter-framework meeting at
                                        PyCon.

                                        I don&#8217;t know enough about
                                        Django&#8217;s development structure to
                                        know if it&#8217;s an oligarchy or not.

                                        Noah is certainly a rebel, but his
                                        interest in customizing something
                                        specifically for himself makes it
                                        unlikely others will follow him, thus no
                                        revolution. I prefer the framework
                                        approach because several minds working
                                        together can build something better than
                                        one mind can. Frameworks are designed to
                                        be used by others besides the author, so
                                        they can attract a movement and thus
                                        form a revolution.

                                        If you think Ian&#8217;s statement was
                                        anti-Django, you don&#8217;t know Ian.
                                        He wasn&#8217;t using
                                        &#8220;oligarchy&#8221; as an insult,
                                        but merely describing its governance
                                        structure as he sees it. Pylons
                                        developers respect Django and its
                                        developers. But Pylons and Django
                                        express opposite design philosophies.
                                        One tries to borrow the best; the other
                                        tries to build something better. You
                                        can&#8217;t expect Pylons developers to
                                        like Django when, if they did,
                                        they&#8217;d have been Django developers
                                        instead. But I think that much of
                                        Django&#8217;s idiosynchracies are
                                        because the right components
                                        didn&#8217;t exist when Django was
                                        written. Maybe if Pylons had existed
                                        then, and were a bit more mature than it
                                        is now, there wouldn&#8217;t have been a
                                        need for a Django project.

                                        revolutionary, I largely mean, following
                                        my own path. I do like this medieval
                                        theme though, and would like there to be
                                        some Jousting mixed into these debates:

                                        Maybe we can get some form of wrestling
                                        or sparring to happen at every PyCon. We
                                        could even write a google app engine
                                        application that kept fighter stats,
                                        weight classes, etc ;) Seriously,
                                        wrestling solves a lot of problems.

                                        Agreed that Ian was definitely not
                                        trying to insult anyone. I wonder how to
                                        describe Grok&#8217;s governance
                                        structure. It&#8217;s being run as an
                                        oligarchy, I guess. We heavily reuse
                                        other systems though, in particular Zope
                                        3, so we follow a lot of design
                                        decisions that originated there. A
                                        federation?
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        Mike: You can excuse Zope 2 for not
                                        having access to the right components
                                        when it was developed in the 90s, but
                                        Django has far less excuse. I think a
                                        lot of the right components did already
                                        exist when Django was written. They were
                                        in Zope 3. :) It&#8217;s just that it
                                        was very hard to see them back then, so
                                        I understand them for not noticing.
                                        (Zope&#8217;s problem, not
                                        Django&#8217;s, too)

                                        Noah: being a stubborn outspoken
                                        Dutchman, I have a lot of sympathy for
                                        following ones own path. I do ally
                                        myself to the Zope framework as I see a
                                        lot of value in both community, reuse,
                                        and avoiding NIH, though spend much of
                                        my time actually pushing it forward.

                                    <p>
                                        There has been a growing movement of
                                        Python cavemen, partly inspired by
                                        Grok&#8217;s mascot, Fred Flintstone
                                        with a club, ready to club down any
                                        unpythonic constructs. Some form of
                                        wrestling at the Python conferences
                                        would be good way to balance the geekish
                                        atmosphere. (&#8220;Hey, we&#8217;re the
                                        only programming conference with our own
                                        wrestling tournament!&#8221;) I do know
                                        a jiu-jitsu guy in Chicago who&#8217;s a
                                        network administrator. He doesn&#8217;t
                                        use Python directly but says, &#8220;I
                                        know what you&#8217;re talking
                                        about.&#8221;
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        Not to offend anybody&#8217;s feelings,
                                        but the Grok mascot does look a bit
                                        wussy. Noah and I could fix that of
                                        course, except that I can&#8217;t draw.
                                        I wonder if Mr PyStone was a fighter
                                        twenty years ago who got worn down by
                                        the military-industrial complex (Zope?).

                                        You&#8217;re not hurting my feelings. My
                                        wife drew Grok&#8217;s mascot, and it
                                        doesn&#8217;t look at all like me, no
                                        matter what people say! So if he looks
                                        wussy I&#8217;m not hurt at all. At all!
                                        No matter what people say! :)

                                        Have you actually seen him in action,

                                        @fubar I just happened to be browsing
                                        through Django&#8217;s source code
                                        looking for something that would help on
                                        some WSGI code I am writing and I did
                                        &#8220;read the source Luke&#8221;. It
                                        is kind of tough though, as there is no
                                        compliance with PEP 8, and in vi all the
                                        lines wrap. I did a svn blame on one
                                        particularly troublesome file, and saw
                                        this:
