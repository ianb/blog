                                    Several times they talk about how small
                                    matters of respect lead to violence. The
                                    conclusion is that guns are the problem.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    I don&#8217;t really know what to do with
                                    this. In <em>my</em> life (and I suspect all
                                    of your lives) issues of respect do not lead
                                    to violence. As a result I have a hard time
                                    thinking of this as a gun problem.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    OK, so it&#8217;s a violence problem. The
                                    other thing that gets me is there&#8217;s
                                    this strong undertone to this conversation
                                    that &quot;we aren&#8217;t doing
                                    enough.&quot; This attitude is of course the
                                    norm for an NPR show. But it&#8217;s
                                    <em>not</em> <strong>we</strong> &#8212; I,
                                    and everyone I know is not part of this
                                    <strong>we</strong>. My &quot;we&quot; does
                                    not resort to violence. My &quot;we&quot;
                                    does not project respect into minor social
                                    interactions. When I say it&#8217;s not
                                    &quot;we&quot;, I don&#8217;t think
                                    it&#8217;s just that I tuned into the wrong
                                    radio show &#8212; am I being recruited into
                                    this &quot;we&quot;? Do they really think
                                    listeners are part of this &quot;we&quot;?

                                    There is no reflection in these shows about
                                    why <em>this</em> (whatever the issue of the
                                    show) is a general problem. Of course most
                                    talk shows tend to generalize wildly, to
                                    turn every anecdote into a sign of some
                                    change in culture, some disease of our
                                    society, something more than just an
                                    anecdote. (Though

                                    NPR shows do <em>not</em> attempt to
                                    generalize anecdotes at all.)

                                    There&#8217;s a strong attitude, in this
                                    show and others, that this is a problem for
                                    us all to solve. Why exactly is this a
                                    problem for me to solve? Why is this a
                                    problem for government to solve? (I&#8217;m
                                    not a conservative, but I feel it&#8217;s
                                    unfair that only conservatives seem to be
                                    able to ask that question: why should
                                    government solve this?)

                                    I don&#8217;t ask these questions
                                    rhetorically (and maybe that makes me
                                    different from the conservatives, who tend
                                    to only ask questions rhetorically). There
                                    may be a good answer to these questions. But
                                    it&#8217;s far too easy to say &quot;we must
                                    do something about this&quot; without saying
                                    <em>who</em> and <em>why</em>. We
                                    (especially those of us who listen to NPR)
                                    are all far too fatigued with the constant
                                    admonitions that not enough is being done,
                                    and something has to change. This kind of
                                    approach is not an effective call to action.

                                        ago. The reason you feel emotion is you
                                        take what they say as being
                                        representative of what people really
                                        think, when in reality all they are
                                        trying to do is push your buttons. If
                                        you really want to know what people
                                        think go converse with them, don&#8217;t
                                        watch TV and think this is real. With
                                        your conversation you will work out
                                        whether people are thinking deeply about
                                        an issue or just thinking shallowly.

                                    <p>Disclaimer: I&#8217;m Australian</p>

                                    <p>
                                        Yes the media can suck but lets change
                                        topics.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        Why is there a problem with violence? Is
                                        there a problem with violence? The USA
                                        is portrayed as a violent gun toting
                                        society but is that the truth?
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        In Australia after a few incidents with
                                        gun violence the government cracked down
                                        on guns. Did this solve our problem with
                                        violence? No I believe it did not it
                                        just transferred the problem so it is
                                        different.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        In the many incidents of violence cited
                                        by modern Australian media there is
                                        always talk of a cultural difference.
                                        Muslims are called intolerant because
                                        they don&#8217;t fit our cultural ideal.
                                        Somalian refugees cause problems because
                                        they don&#8217;t properly integrate with
                                        our society.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        So we seem to have transferred the blame
                                        of societal violence from weapons to
                                        cultural differences. This is no
                                        different from gun control. We have no
                                        ability to affect cultural differences
                                        so therefore there is no solution to the
                                        problem.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        It is closer to the truth but still
                                        walking a big wide circle around it. A
                                        clever trick to make us feel guilty for
                                        something we really have no control
                                        over. As if the violence in society is
                                        somehow the responsibility of certain
                                        members of society alone and not the
                                        responsibility of those actually
                                        committing the violence.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        Why do our societies transmit the blame
                                        from those who commit the crime to other
                                        groups? I don&#8217;t know but I think
                                        that is a more interesting story than
                                        gun control or water.

                                        is this a problem for government to
                                        solve?&#8221;

                                        I think that social problems like these
                                        are best addressed through better
                                        education, because education is, after
                                        all, about giving children the tools
                                        they need to be able to live decent
                                        lives in a modern, well-functioning
                                        society. Of course, this doesn&#8217;t
                                        provide a quick solution or seem like a
                                        timely reaction when one is apparently
                                        needed, so there will always be the
                                        temptation to take other action, but
                                        regardless of whether such other action
                                        is beneficial, if the underlying,
                                        long-term factors aren&#8217;t addressed
                                        then any action will have a limited
                                        impact.
                                    </p>

                                        Naturally, saying that education needs
                                        to be improved doesn&#8217;t
                                        &#8220;inspire&#8221; voters, but
                                        that&#8217;s where society in general
                                        gets caught up in the matters described,
                                        regardless of whether anyone feels that
                                        they identify with a particular group of
                                        people or not (and such groups have to
                                        be part of the wider society, or
                                        you&#8217;ve just created a parallel
                                        society with all the dangers and
                                        disadvantages that this carries with
                                        it). The voters choose their government
                                        who in turn gets to set the priorities
                                        in society. Sadly, recalling some
                                        electioneering in the United Kingdom a
                                        few years ago, things like education are
                                        &#8220;expensive&#8221; and any small
                                        increase in taxation to pay for it is
                                        thus &#8220;unpopular&#8221;. Of course,
                                        waging war is also expensive &#8211;
                                        much more so than previous funding
                                        proposals for improving the education
                                        system &#8211; and it&#8217;s only after
                                        certain countries have accumulated huge
                                        debts that the investments in education
                                        and other areas start to appear rather
                                        modest.

                                        Perhaps there&#8217;s scope for some
                                        kind of slogan where you replace the
                                        neglected area of public policy as
                                        appropriate: &#8220;Education &#8211;
                                        expensive, yes, but surprisingly
                                        affordable compared to war.&#8221;

                                        @richard: &#8220;Did this solve our
                                        problem with violence? No I believe it
                                        did not it just transferred the problem
                                        so it is different.&#8221;
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        Not being either American or Australian
                                        I follow the lengthy discussions of gun
                                        control trying not to take sides, but I
                                        feel a question should be asked here:
                                        isn&#8217;t &#8220;transferring the
                                        problem&#8221; exactly the desired
                                        effect? You can&#8217;t stop people from
                                        resorting to violence as means of
                                        dealing with conflicts, but you can
                                        &#8211; or you can try, with various
                                        levels of success &#8211; stop them from
                                        shooting each other. There is a big
                                        difference between a broken nose and a
                                        head shot through.

                                        In response I say people are still being
                                        killed just not by the same methods. If
                                        I look at the massacres in Rawanda I
                                        don&#8217;t see a lot of shots being
                                        fired but I do see a lot of people being
                                        killed. In Australia I don&#8217;t think
                                        the murder rate dropped by much. Many
                                        anti-gun fanatics (myself included) like
                                        to say we are less violent than America
                                        due to our stricter gun laws but that
                                        doesn&#8217;t take into consideration
                                        other factors such as lower population
                                        density, lower difference between the
                                        poor and rich, different cultural mixes
                                        etc. It looks nice on paper but reality
                                        I fear is not much different than from
                                        before the laws were implemented. People
                                        who want to kill other people are not
                                        going to be stopped just because you
                                        take a certain type of weapon away. Just
                                        as suicide is not stopped by the removal
                                        of guns murder is not stopped either.
                                        You might chip away at certain types of
                                        crime by such a method but you
                                        won&#8217;t eliminate it all.

                                        Plus it is disingenuous to say that
                                        actually lowers violence. People are
                                        still motivated to do harm even if they
                                        find it hard to do the act. We have many
                                        cases come through the courts that
                                        involve murder just without the guns.

                                        @richard: my point is, basically, that
                                        it is easier to kill with a gun than by
                                        other means. I&#8217;m not saying gun
                                        control lowers violence. I&#8217;m
                                        saying I would expect that, all other
                                        things being equal, the same violent
                                        people would kill more other people with
                                        guns than without them. I&#8217;m not a
                                        scientist, and if there&#8217;s evidence
                                        to the contrary I&#8217;ll call it
                                        counter-intuitive, but I&#8217;ll accept
                                        it. However, few people protest stricter
                                        seat-belt rules, or stricter
                                        drunk-driving rules etc. even though
                                        it&#8217;s obvious that they can&#8217;t
                                        stop people from dying in car accidents,
                                        and can&#8217;t stop other people from
                                        reckless driving or drunk driving. In
                                        some areas everybody is happy to just
                                        reduce the death toll by a margin. I
                                        can&#8217;t see what&#8217;s so special
                                        about gun control (leaving aside for a
                                        moment the USA and their constitution).

                                        For those lives it does save it does
                                        make sense. However you can&#8217;t
                                        extrapolate that by saying eliminating
                                        guns eliminates violence. There are
                                        other weapons that kill better than guns
                                        and we keep very tight lids on them, so
                                        yes having some sanity in gun control
                                        makes sense and saves lives.

                                        your logic is very confusing. It is not
                                        a clear way of thinking.
                                    </p>

                                        Violence, in the context of gun control,
                                        is normally understood to be referring
                                        to crime or assault conducted with the
                                        use of firearm. But you have somehow
                                        introduced a context of violence as a
                                        state of mind, as a kind of hostility.
                                        Then you assert that this violence
                                        (hostility) has been
                                        &#8220;transferred&#8221; to another
                                        area, namely xenophobia. It is not easy
                                        to follow this sort of argument.

                                        Anyway, it is a lot safer on Sydney
                                        streets then anywhere in USA (although
                                        stabbing is a new trend here in Sydney.
                                        Usually fatal.) But American believe gun
                                        deters crime. So be it.

                                        i think it is &#8220;everyones&#8221;
                                        problem to some degree (in the united
                                        states, anyway) because issues like
                                        these <em>are</em> greatly impacted by
                                        government. The incarceration rate of
                                        black men in their 20&#8242;s is
                                        something like 20% (just googled),
                                        largely due to things like the
                                        &#8220;war on drugs&#8221;, which is
                                        entirely a government initiative (and
                                        incarceration itself as well as its
                                        terms are entirely mandated by
                                        government as well). When 20% of your
                                        friends get hauled off to jail on a
                                        regular basis, things like that just
                                        don&#8217;t have a positive effect on
                                        the development of a community. So I
                                        think even the attitudes and voting
                                        patterns of places as far removed from
                                        urban violence as nebraska and oklahoma
                                        ultimately have an effect on the issue
                                        through channels such as this one.

                                        If you walk by a pond and see two kids
                                        flailing away, drowning, it&#8217;s also
                                        not your fault, but I hope it&#8217;s
                                        your concern.

                                        As a society, we have the option to be
                                        concerned enough to want to do something
                                        about it, even if the pond isn&#8217;t
                                        in our neighborhood. Maybe we&#8217;ll
                                        require the abutters to put up a fence,
                                        or require schools to teach swimming, or
                                        we&#8217;ll jail the parents. Or, we
                                        could just blame the kids who ignored
                                        the sign.

                                        I think most of us would agree that
                                        something should be done to prevent more
                                        deaths. Discussing these concerns
                                        publicly is one step in coming to
                                        consensus about what should be done.

                                    <p>
                                        Well sure, it&#8217;d be nice to do
                                        something about gun violence. I
                                        don&#8217;t disagree with this. That
                                        doesn&#8217;t actually mean there
                                        <em>is</em> something to be done, at
                                        least in any generic sense. This is a
                                        specific problem in specific
                                        communities. While these are areas with
                                        poverty, I would be surprised if this
                                        violence actually correlated with
                                        poverty. And yes, there are a variety of
                                        problems, including a very high rate of
                                        incarceration among black men. But
                                        looking for underlying reasons can
                                        itself be a means of avoidance. In part
                                        because those underlying reasons are
                                        hard to fix. If this <em>really</em> is
                                        an important issue, then it&#8217;s
                                        worth fixing directly, as presumably the
                                        symptom is itself damaging.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        Then the question: how direct do you
                                        want to be? Guns kill people, get rid of
                                        guns? Or, bullets kill people, get rid
                                        of ammunition (one technique that
                                        actually was proposed is making
                                        ammunition harder to acquire). Of course
                                        people are most likely to be killed by
                                        someone they know. Stop the right to
                                        assembly! Well, that&#8217;s silly, but
                                        ostracism is not so silly. But it only
                                        works when there is a small number of
                                        disfunctional people &#8212; what if
                                        violence (most of it non-fatal of
                                        course) is widespread? Then we&#8217;re
                                        just circling back to the segregation
                                        and high incarceration rates that
                                        themselves add to the problem.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        Another technique people take up
                                        personally is simply to leave these
                                        communities. And for any one family,
                                        this is a very sensible approach. But
                                        this evaporation of people from a
                                        community is itself a part of the
                                        problem. And are these small-scale
                                        choices analogous of the large-scale
                                        choices society and government makes?

                                        Well, if the direct solution is
                                        ridiculous (ostracize people before they
                                        commit a crime), maybe the indirect
                                        solution is worth looking at.

                                        I googled up a couple papers. The first

                                            In research on social
                                            disorganization in urban settings,

                                            and consistently associated with
                                            rates of crime and delinquency are

                                        <p>
                                            Over the decades, numerous aggregate
                                            studies have empirically supported
                                            the poverty and crime relationship.
                                            Many of these studies have observed
                                            the highest crime rates within the
                                            poorest urban slums (Curtis, 1974).
                                            A linkage between crime and economic
                                            conditions has also been found at
                                            higher levels of aggregation, such
                                            as cities and states (Loftin and
                                            Hill; Smith and Parker). Many
                                            leading criminologists believe that
                                            the poverty-crime relationship is
                                            clear and direct.
                                        </p>

                                            This positive relationship between
                                            poverty and crime, for the most
                                            part, went uncontested until Blau
                                            and Blau put forth the hypothesis
                                            that racial economic inequality,
                                            more than poverty, spells the
                                            potential for violence.
                                            Socioeconomic inequalities
                                            associated with ascribed positions
                                            (i.e., being a minority), they
                                            argue, engender pervasive conflict
                                            in a democracy. While great economic
                                            inequalities generally foster
                                            conflict and violence, ascriptive
                                            inequalities do so particularly.
                                            Pronounced ascriptive inequalities
                                            transform the experience of poverty
                                            for many into the hereditary
                                            permanent state of being one of the
                                            poor.

                                        This is probably as much as I have time
                                        to discuss this. There&#8217;s real
                                        science out there that has been done and
                                        still needs to be done to understand the
                                        causes and suggest
                                        <em>real</em> solutions. The rest is a
                                        never-ending discussion on whether we
                                        want to try.

                                        If they are poor how can they afford
                                        guns? If you are that poor other things
                                        are far more important to you. I know
                                        because I sit at the poverty threshold.

                                        Maybe they are a) Not poor b) Get the
                                        guns from elsewhere c) Save up to buy
                                        guns d) Guns are cheaper than food, or
                                        the cost of bills, if a gun cost me only
                                        AUD20 then I could afford it.

                                        Ian, the major problem, I think, with
                                        what we might call the &#8220;NPR
                                        approach&#8221; towards problems of
                                        violence is the implicit assumption that
                                        killing a man for a minor offense is
                                        aberrant, and therefore that we have to
                                        conjure up some great malignant force
                                        that must have produced it. Thus all of
                                        the bogeys that have been trotted out
                                        over the years, from blaming the evils
                                        inherent in private property (Marx) to
                                        blaming the inability of teenage boys to
                                        have sex whenever they want (Carl Sagan
                                        in <i>Cosmos</i>, which I read as a
                                        teenage boy, and, boy, was I a fan).
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        But, in fact, retaliating with
                                        overwhelming force against even
                                        perceived slights is the normal way that
                                        males of our species defend territory —
                                        so, NPR should be looking and digging
                                        for explanations of you and your friends
                                        and why you behave non-violently, and
                                        ask how on earth people like you came
                                        about through world history, rather than
                                        wringing their hands over perfectly

                                        You have chosen a perfect time to ask
                                        this question: just in the last few
                                        weeks, two superb articles have come out
                                        addressing this very issue. I suggest
                                        that you start with Jared

                                        There is a base level of criminality and
                                        violence in the human condition but some
                                        cultures make it worse. The black
                                        economist Thomas Sowell blames such
                                        &#8220;honor&#8221; cultures in America
                                        on the Scotch-Irish who were largely

                                        (that isn&#8217;t a recommendation, I
                                        haven&#8217;t read it). There are many
                                        causes of poverty but all honor cultures
                                        are poor or would be if they
                                        weren&#8217;t sitting on oil wells.
                                        Honor subcultures in otherwise
                                        Western/protestant countries (e.g. gangs
                                        and the mafia) are also poor and
                                        violent. I can&#8217;t find a link but
                                        gangs and the mafia (and the KKK!) are
                                        known as &#8220;tournament&#8221;
                                        economies. Very few of the members make
                                        much money and the lowest members
                                        participate at great risk to themselves.
                                        They take the risk because the few top
                                        dogs make decent cash and more
                                        importantly are feted by everyone below
                                        them. All the participants delude
                                        themselves that they will make it to the
                                        top (see also: waiters who are going to
                                        be rock stars/models/writers). It is
                                        easy to see how tournament economies
                                        thrive in honor cultures.

                                        The easiest way to win is not to play.
                                        People who don&#8217;t know criminals
                                        generally don&#8217;t get shot, stabbed,
                                        or raped. The statistics are true:
                                        people who get shot are likely to get
                                        shot by someone they know (and possibly
                                        with their own gun!) but what that stat
                                        leaves out is that the shooter already
                                        has a criminal record. If you are a 25
                                        year old male without a criminal record
                                        the chances of you ever having one are
                                        vanishingly close to zero.

                                        All of the above is why this isn&#8217;t
                                        a problem for you, me, and
                                        &#8220;we.&#8221; We&#8217;re not
                                        playing that game. For the same reason
                                        the government can&#8217;t really solve
                                        the problem: culture is local and
                                        pervasive. The government can stop
                                        exacerbating the problem though, and
                                        has; the housing projects which
                                        concentrated violent honor/tournament
                                        cultures have mostly been torn down.

                                        An aside about gun stats: don&#8217;t
                                        trust them. In Anglo countries there is
                                        little difference in violent crime
                                        despite widely varying levels of gun
                                        control though some specific categories
                                        vary (the UK has a high home invasion
                                        rate, the US has a higher murder rate).
                                        Gun stats that cite
                                        &#8220;children&#8221; include 19 year
                                        old &#8220;children&#8221; to capture
                                        young males at their violent best. Be
                                        suspicious of the phrase &#8220;gun
                                        deaths&#8221; because it includes
                                        suicide; the US rate for &#8220;gun
                                        deaths&#8221; is quite high because it
                                        includes suicide-by-gun. It
                                        shouldn&#8217;t be a surprise that the
                                        US suicide rate is nestled in between
                                        cold Canada and sunny Australia &#8211;
                                        men [and they are overwhelmingly men]
                                        find a way.

                                        You are correct, suicide rate by gun in
                                        the US is high.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        However, homicide rate is also high: 4
                                        in 100,000 in the US, under 1 in 100,000
                                        everywhere else.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        Regarding the original topic, it&#8217;s
                                        the &#8220;monkeysphere&#8221; in action
                                        again. We find it very hard to care
                                        about people not in our own social
                                        network. &#8220;Society&#8221; in terms
                                        of cities and nations is not one
                                        cohesive community, it&#8217;s thousands
                                        of them crammed in together.

                                        People who commit violence have social
                                        and/or mental problems. Easy access to
                                        lethal weapons increases the risk that
                                        these people commit violence with a
                                        lethal outcome. End of story.

                                        The touchy feely liberalism of NPR likes
                                        to take the easy route in such complex
                                        issues as gun control. Some of the posts
                                        here do as well ;). For instance, I can
                                        assume that the murder rate and violent
                                        crime are tied to the level of access
                                        that the mentally unstable and poor have
                                        to firearms, and I would be right! The
                                        problem is that this doesn&#8217;t look
                                        critically at what constitutes the
                                        murder rate, violent crime, and mental
                                        instability. Violent crime is
                                        perpetrated most often by a poor person
                                        with a gun. Violent crime is not, as in
                                        the case of the Ford Pinto, a business
                                        making the decision that recalling a car
                                        with a faulty gas tank is less cost
                                        effective than dealing with lawsuits
                                        that occur due to preventable deaths.
                                        Furthermore, why should a murderous law
                                        enforcement agency(see Sean Bell case
                                        among others) have access to firearms
                                        while I do not? The right to bear arms
                                        means equal access.

                                    <p>Also, I&#8217;m not a conservative.</p>
