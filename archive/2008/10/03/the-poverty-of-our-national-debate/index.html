                                    We had a debate party tonight for the
                                    Biden-Palin debate. It&#8217;s nice to watch
                                    it in a group of like-minded people. Taking
                                    the Democrat/Republican debate seriously is
                                    a bullshit game and I don&#8217;t have any
                                    desire to bring this farce into my normal
                                    life.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    After the debate was over, I wanted to
                                    discuss the debate. After all, it&#8217;s
                                    weird to watch something for an hour and a
                                    half and then just ignore that we spent that
                                    time watching it. The problem is that I
                                    <em>hate</em> the punditry. No one actually
                                    said &quot;did Palin do what she had to
                                    do?&quot; (I probably would have screamed)
                                    but it&#8217;s just really <em>hard</em> not
                                    to talk about &quot;what will people think
                                    of this debate?&quot; And part of that is
                                    because we all know what <em>we</em> think.
                                    We saw through Palin deliberately ignoring
                                    the questions and reading her
                                    already-prepared speech. We all had a basic
                                    understanding of what is fact and what is a
                                    lie or misrepresentation. It&#8217;s nice to
                                    share little stories (like stories from the
                                    article about how

                                    into a discussion about the horserace, about
                                    what other people will think. Why is it so
                                    hard to talk about what we think? Not what
                                    we analyze, but what we actually believe?
                                    Instead of predicting something that will
                                    come to pass regardless of our predictions,
                                    shouldn&#8217;t we be developing our own
                                    beliefs? That seems far more relevant to our
                                    lives.

                                    There&#8217;s probably a lot of reasons for
                                    that. It&#8217;s intimidating to be entirely
                                    genuine, to speak without irony. And all the
                                    news is about the horserace, so we are all
                                    well informed, it makes it easy to talk.

                                    I think a large part of the problem is that
                                    the spectrum of opinions is so narrow (even
                                    if also bifurcated) that it&#8217;s hard to
                                    have an interesting discussion of political
                                    issues. Lacking anything of real substance
                                    to discuss, we discuss the discussion, we
                                    make predictions instead of forming real
                                    opinions. While I&#8217;m willing to blame
                                    many things on the Republicans, this is the
                                    product of both parties, of the narrow
                                    ignorance of &quot;conventional
                                    wisdom.&quot; For instance, the debate about
                                    the economic bailout has been rich with
                                    rhetoric but starved of any real ideas. I
                                    didn&#8217;t even realize how limited the
                                    debate was until I listened to

                                    can do whatever we want. That is to say, we
                                    can actually make collective decisions about
                                    the direction of our economy, instead of the
                                    impotent position that is assumed in all
                                    current debates, where we can only poke
                                    lightly at the economy (and it&#8217;s
                                    implied anything more would destroy it).

                                    We can&#8217;t really talk about what kind

                                    because the system nearly everyone wants is
                                    not an acceptable part of conventional
                                    wisdom. Socialized healthcare is the only
                                    reasonable option, but of course
                                    there&#8217;s lots of ways it could work,
                                    there&#8217;s lots of room for genuine and
                                    important discussion. But instead we have a

                                    In the end our own happiness is mostly in
                                    our own hands. The choices we make for
                                    ourselves are more significant than the
                                    choices made by the government (the choices
                                    we make collectively). But our collective
                                    choices do matter. We certainly
                                    haven&#8217;t figured out happiness. And
                                    maybe government does best when it has the
                                    least effect on our lives, but while
                                    that&#8217;s one end of the bifurcated
                                    conventional wisdom, as an idea it remains
                                    largely uninspected. When I consider many of
                                    the pleasant conveniences in my life,
                                    government is part of a lot of them. It
                                    doesn&#8217;t do much to make me more
                                    spiritually fulfilled, but the idea that
                                    government is a hopeless place to look for
                                    our collective happiness is a truism that
                                    lacks real consideration.

                                    Political discussion is stuck in a terrible
                                    intellectual rut. Blame falls equally on
                                    both parties. They hold on greedily to their
                                    monopoly of political thought. It&#8217;s
                                    like religious doctrine, something to which
                                    politicians must submit before being allowed
                                    to progress, a sign of submission to a
                                    larger system of power. I have this hope
                                    that Obama is going through the rites with
                                    discipline but without true belief, that he
                                    is being subversive, diving straight to the
                                    belly of the beast. But this is only
                                    speculation, perhaps a naive dream, a desire
                                    to project my hopes onto a figure of vague
                                    and general hope.

                                    I don&#8217;t really want to spend too much
                                    time discussing all the things that are
                                    wrong. This is the depressing comfort zone
                                    of the left. I want to talk about how things
                                    could be right, about how we can make a
                                    world that isn&#8217;t just less unjust but
                                    a world that is more beautiful, more
                                    wonderful, more full of life and freedom and
                                    passion. I want to exult in the potential of
                                    the future.

                                        I&#8217;m not sure I can follow the
                                        thread that your lack of political
                                        debate with like-minded friends is the
                                        fault of the two parties. That&#8217;s
                                        not in defense of recent politics, but
                                        you&#8217;ve defined the issue long
                                        before you stated it. If you&#8217;re
                                        going to sit in a room of like-minded
                                        individuals, you can&#8217;t expect much
                                        diversity in thought.

                                        Similarly &#8211; though not on purpose
                                        &#8211; I found myself in a packed bar
                                        in Brooklyn, surrounded by people
                                        cheering Biden and booing and laughing
                                        at the obviously scripted and
                                        well-trained Palin. Everyone was proud
                                        to react as such and I found very little
                                        difference in the crowd.

                                        Like-minded groups are not the place for

                                        Our politicians and our media have their
                                        parts in this, but so do we &#8211;
                                        Every last one of us. Without us, the
                                        members of politics and the media
                                        can&#8217;t feed their loved ones.
                                        Feeding their families and feeding their
                                        BS are one in the same.

                                        Narrowing the spectrum of the political
                                        discussion is a very conscious decision
                                        of the US government, achieved by tight
                                        control over mass media.

                                        the beast&#8221; (the public), is a key
                                        weapon of the ruling class of any type
                                        of government, from despotism to (fake)
                                        democracy, to keep themselves in their
                                        position. In dictatorships this is more
                                        easily achieved by means of force, in
                                        democratic countries it happens by means

                                        The author also suggests that both
                                        Democratic and Republican parties,
                                        during their election campaign, stick to
                                        an arranged script, which makes it hard
                                        for the issues that really matter to
                                        enter the public discussion. The public
                                        is trained through the media to be
                                        like-minded. People with opinions
                                        outside the spectrum are easily
                                        dismissed.

                                    <p>
                                        We were like-minded insofar as we
                                        disliked one side and liked the other.
                                        That this is what passes for
                                        &#8220;politically like-minded&#8221; is
                                        what I have a problem with. In fact
                                        I&#8217;m quite certain we&#8217;d all
                                        disagree on lots of other things, but
                                        the mainstream political discussion is
                                        so narrow and the spectrum of ideas so
                                        small that there&#8217;s little room for
                                        diversity among well-informed people.
                                        Yeah, I could go out and seek someone
                                        who really likes Palin an discuss
                                        politics. But that person is almost
                                        certain to be ignorant, disingenuous, or
                                        just deeply wrong-headed, and I
                                        can&#8217;t have a reasonable
                                        discussion. I could try to
                                        <em>understand</em> that person, sure.
                                        But understanding another person&#8217;s
                                        position isn&#8217;t the same as having
                                        a constructive discussion.

                                        The absoluteness of this statement
                                        disturbs me, Ian:

                                    <p>
                                        &#8220;But [someone who likes Palin] is
                                        almost certain to be ignorant,
                                        disingenuous, or just deeply
                                        wrong-headed, and I can’t have a
                                        reasonable discussion.&#8221;

                                        I do not pretend to like Palin, or even
                                        to be informed enough to have an
                                        opinion. But the idea that the opposite
                                        side is so ignorant or deeply
                                        wrong-headed that you can&#8217;t have a
                                        constructive discussion with them&#8230;

                                        Frankly, I think the potshots at Palin
                                        and McCain in your article detract from
                                        the more interesting point of your
                                        article, which I agree with. Also, the
                                        comparison to religious doctrine offends
                                        me, as I do not subscribe to any
                                        religious doctrine for the reasons you
                                        mention. Dogmatic and institutional
                                        doctrine has those properties, but the
                                        idea that all religious doctrines are
                                        dogmatic or institutional is wrong.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        Again, I really appreciate the main
                                        thrust of the article. Political debate
                                        in this country is completely stagnated,
                                        as is religious debate. Unless you
                                        happen to find someone with whom you can
                                        be open (a rare treasure, indeed), both
                                        debates belong to certain institutional
                                        views that no one is allowed to
                                        challenge. What disappoints me is the
                                        degree to which you broadcast those
                                        views in this article.

                                        I feel like making offerings to some
                                        &#8220;non-partisan&#8221; stance is
                                        falling into the two-sets-of-ideas
                                        mindset. I&#8217;m not interested in a
                                        Republican/Democrat debate, because I
                                        think the Republican stance completely
                                        lacks credibility and is disingenuous. I
                                        don&#8217;t particularly believe in the
                                        Democratic stance, but at least
                                        there&#8217;s room to discuss. All of
                                        which is not to say that conservative
                                        values lack credibility, or that holding
                                        those view is a disingenuous stance. But
                                        in letting the parties serve as
                                        placeholders for ideas, we discard
                                        genuine discussion.

                                        I also believe that a useful discussion
                                        needs to start with some common
                                        understandings between the people.
                                        Finding the person I disagree with most
                                        and debating them serves no point.
                                        Finding them and trying to understand
                                        where they are coming from is
                                        interesting in a kind of scientific way,
                                        but without some common understandings
                                        it isn&#8217;t constructive. It might
                                        tell me about the world as they see it,
                                        but it does little to inform my own
                                        opinions.

                                        As to political specifics, I think
                                        McCain is a very troubling figure, but
                                        Palin is beyond the pale, and I
                                        can&#8217;t respect anyone that with
                                        genuine and well-informed support of
                                        her. At some point I feel the need to
                                        set aside positions I find despicable
                                        &#8212; I can rail against those ideas,
                                        but it doesn&#8217;t improve my own
                                        ideas. And I&#8217;m not going to hide
                                        the fact I find the Republicans
                                        despicable. The whole idea &#8220;the
                                        truth is somewhere in the middle&#8221;
                                        is wrong. That&#8217;s the entire point
                                        I was trying to get across. First: there
                                        are no ends to the lines of thought so
                                        that you can measure to the middle.
                                        Second: there is no single line of ideas
                                        that can have a middle (it isn&#8217;t
                                        even 2D or 3D). Third: truth and
                                        falsehood exist, and all perspectives
                                        are not equally valid. Also, debating
                                        with lies is a losing game &#8212; you
                                        can&#8217;t win the debate, and you
                                        won&#8217;t come out any smarter trying.

                                        As to religion, it was not my intention
                                        to disparage religion. It was more my
                                        intention to allude to, say, the
                                        medieval politics of the Catholic
                                        church. To practices and philosophies
                                        that are enforced but not put to any
                                        consideration, that are accepted without
                                        critical thought but still made a
                                        requirement of &#8220;true
                                        belief.&#8221; And&#8230; well, that
                                        could describe certain religious
                                        doctrine, and I suppose I&#8217;m okay
                                        with that, as I do not have respect for
                                        intellectual obedience. But that&#8217;s
                                        certainly not all religion, not even
                                        most religion, and if I implied that
                                        I&#8217;m sorry for the offense.

                                        the VP debate was stunning. Palin did a
                                        decent job faking about 20% of the
                                        questions and didn&#8217;t even bother
                                        answering the other 80%.

                                        debate moderator says to Adam Sandler,
                                        &#8220;Mr. Madison, what you&#8217;ve
                                        just said is one of the most insanely
                                        idiotic things I have ever heard. At no
                                        point in your rambling, incoherent
                                        response were you even close to anything
                                        that could be considered a rational
                                        thought. Everyone in this room is now
                                        dumber for having listened to it. I

                                        It&#8217;s unfortunate that there is no

                                        system makes it impossible to have a
                                        real choice. Certainly the Republican
                                        ticket is not a choice for informed
                                        individuals.

                                        The notion of a non-partisan stance is,
                                        as Ian points out, simply not possible
                                        when it comes to these two parties; as
                                        an editorial in today&#8217;s nytimes
                                        points out, mccains choice of palin is
                                        either very cynical or an unforgivable
                                        blunder; this isn&#8217;t some
                                        government position up in alaska,
                                        it&#8217;s the vp position of a country
                                        that is not only the most important
                                        economic power in the world, but one
                                        that&#8217;s been warmongering for five
                                        years.

                                        I think the frustration you are feeling
                                        has to do with the fact that we are
                                        allowed choices on most every thing in
                                        our lives except who we vote for. All of
                                        the &#8220;candidates&#8221; who end up
                                        in the &#8220;horse race&#8221; are
                                        vetted, bought and paid for by the
                                        moneyed elites in this country. A
                                        &#8220;choice&#8221; between 1 of the
                                        two wings of the single &#8220;American
                                        Political Party&#8221; is not a choice
                                        at all. Mass media &#8220;political
                                        discussion&#8221; is tightly framed and
                                        only allowed to reach so far by the
                                        media, pundits and candidates
                                        themselves.

                                        I tell everyone when asked who I will
                                        vote for that I will not vote and give
                                        the above reasons why. As well as the
                                        fact that it is not the people who cast
                                        votes that decide these contests, it is
                                        the people who count them.

                                        Modern life is a return to serfdom. I do
                                        not think there has been a clean
                                        election in this country in 60 years.
                                        Most &#8220;progressive&#8221; people
                                        tell me I am doing exactly what they
                                        want me to do by not voting, but I think
                                        the opposite is true. First off, by
                                        voting you are giving a completely
                                        corrupt and criminal government
                                        recognition and validation. Secondly, if
                                        more and more people chose not to vote,
                                        and this brought down the number of
                                        eligible voters down to a laughable
                                        number, that would create more political
                                        upheaval than if even more people
                                        validate the &#8220;choices&#8221;
                                        thrust upon us.

                                        I don&#8217;t know, I&#8217;ve really
                                        given up on any kind of political
                                        &#8220;change&#8221; here. Really step
                                        back and think about this: As the white
                                        house moves from GOP to DEM and back,
                                        what real changes are there in foreign
                                        policy and most domestic policy that is
                                        not window dressing like tax rates and
                                        other minor things? Clinton killed
                                        almost as many people in the middle east
                                        as Bush. (Of course we get more dead and
                                        maimed for our money with the GOP in
                                        charge).

                                        advice, as regards presidential debates
                                        anyway.

                                    <p>Nice post Ian.</p>

                                    <p>
                                        &#8220;I feel like making offerings to
                                        some “non-partisan” stance is falling
                                        into the two-sets-of-ideas mindset. I’m
                                        not interested in a Republican/Democrat
                                        debate, because I think the Republican
                                        stance completely lacks credibility and
                                        is disingenuous. I don’t particularly
                                        believe in the Democratic stance, but at
                                        least there’s room to discuss. All of
                                        which is not to say that conservative
                                        values lack credibility, or that holding
                                        those view is a disingenuous stance. But
                                        in letting the parties serve as
                                        placeholders for ideas, we discard
                                        genuine discussion.&#8221;
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        To my mind, this is the real insight
                                        that you article could benefit from
                                        stressing further. Swap the positions of
                                        Republican and Democrat in the
                                        paragraph, and I could see myself saying
                                        it&#8230;but then that&#8217;s really
                                        the rub, isn&#8217;t it?
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        I think the bigger issue at stake here
                                        is the fact that presidential elections
                                        steal the voters&#8217; collective focus
                                        from the (still somewhat effective)
                                        representation they should expect from
                                        Congress. Local representatives, in most
                                        areas, have to campaign with a much more
                                        tangible agenda. Neither Obama nor
                                        McCain will accomplish 90% of their
                                        &#8220;platforms&#8221;, and
                                        that&#8217;s by design. &#8220;Party
                                        platforms&#8221; are an all-you-can-eat
                                        buffet, there&#8217;s something there
                                        for everyone, but if they made you eat
                                        some of every dish, nobody would eat
                                        there.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        If I were the king of the forest&#8230;.
                                        I would make the presidential ballot a
                                        multiple-choice survey that asks the
                                        voter where they stand on the top 5
                                        issues (pick any 5 really) and casts
                                        their vote for the candidate they are
                                        most aligned with. It would be a
                                        terrible system for choosing the next
                                        president, but is arguably more accurate
                                        in choosing the one who the majority of
                                        the people &#8220;agree with&#8221;.
                                        This could eliminate the primaries as
                                        well as the first 2 years of
                                        campaigning. I suggest we use the free
                                        air time to show reruns of Fraggle Rock.
