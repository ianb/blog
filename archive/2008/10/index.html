                                            programmatic API in pip at this
                                            point, but with no consumers of the
                                            API it feels like premature design
                                            to settle on something now &#8212;
                                            integrate with pip and we can figure
                                            out what that stable API should be.
                                            If you integrate buildout, probably
                                            another useful feature would be an

                                            because, I guess, he wanted a

                                            and it seems like a kind of

                                            I figured I&#8217;d do it too.

                                            I&#8217;d summarize his argument

                                                resource formats, i.e., document
                                                formats. The protocol will flow
                                                from these if they are well
                                                specified.

                                                server layout. You can&#8217;t
                                                hold them, you can&#8217;t pass
                                                them around, there is no notion
                                                of CRUD. Media types have all
                                                sorts of advantages that URL
                                                structures do not.

                                            JSON is a reasonable structure for a
                                            media type. It is not
                                            <em>itself</em> a fully explained
                                            type, because it&#8217;s just a
                                            container for data, just like XML.
                                            In this example you have a document,

                                            identical in practice, but by
                                            putting <strong>URLs</strong> in the
                                            JSON document instead of this
                                            abstract &quot;id&quot; notion
                                            you&#8217;ve created a more flexible
                                            and self-describing system. You
                                            could probably give a name to that
                                            list of URLs, and then just talk
                                            about that name.

                                            an entry, it&#8217;s made explicit.
                                            Thus you can move the entry around,

                                            client to know or guess where those
                                            other things are.

                                            information to any HTML homepage so

                                            I&#8217;ll add my own little opinion
                                            in here: this is why the URL
                                            structure of applications
                                            doesn&#8217;t affect their
                                            RESTfulness, nor is URL structure
                                            all that important of a concern
                                            generally. Pretty URL structures are
                                            a nice thing to do, like indenting
                                            your code in a pleasant way, but it
                                            has nothing to do with your API, and
                                            if you can&#8217;t use a crappy URL
                                            structure with that same API then
                                            probably something is wrong with
                                            that API.

                                                Right now we live in an age of
                                                <em>platforms</em>. Developers
                                                (or management or coincidence)
                                                decides on a platform, and that
                                                serves as the basis for all
                                                future development. Usually
                                                there&#8217;s some old things
                                                from a previous platform (or a
                                                primordial pre-platform age:

                                                eliminate all of these old
                                                pieces, rewriting them for the
                                                new platform. That goal is
                                                seldom attained in a timely
                                                manner, and even before it is
                                                accomplished you may be moving
                                                to the next platform.

                                                Why do you have to port
                                                everything forward to the newest
                                                platform? Well, presumably it is
                                                better engineered. The newest
                                                platform is presumably what
                                                people are most familiar with.
                                                But if those were the only
                                                reasons it would be hard to
                                                justify a rewrite of working
                                                software. Often the real push
                                                comes because your systems
                                                don&#8217;t work together.
                                                It&#8217;s hard to keep
                                                templates in sync across all the
                                                platforms. Multiple logins may
                                                be required. Navigation is
                                                inconsistent and incomplete.

                                                The answer is probably 2 or 3,
                                                because it would be too hard to
                                                integrate something foreign to
                                                your platform. This form of
                                                choice means that every platform
                                                has some kind of
                                                &quot;blog&quot;, but the users
                                                of that blog are likely to only
                                                be a subset of the users of the
                                                parent platform. This makes it
                                                difficult for winners to emerge,
                                                or for a well-developed piece of
                                                software to really be
                                                successful. Platform-based
                                                software is limited by the
                                                adoption of the platform.

                                                turn into platforms. WordPress
                                                is practically a CMS. Trac too.
                                                Extensible applications, if
                                                successful, become their own
                                                platform. This is not to place

                                                pieces can be dynamic &#8212;
                                                again, Deliverance only cares
                                                about HTML and HTTP, it
                                                doesn&#8217;t worry about what
                                                produces the response.
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                                This is all very similar to
                                                systems built on XSLT
                                                transforms, except without the
                                                XSLT
                                                <a
                                                    class="footnote-reference"
                                                    href="index.html#id6"
                                                    id="id2"
                                                    >[†]</a
                                                >, and without XML. Strictly
                                                speaking you can apply XSLT to
                                                any parseable markup, even HTML,
                                                but the most common (or at least
                                                most talked about) way to apply
                                                XSLT is using
                                                &quot;semantic&quot; XML output
                                                that is transformed into HTML.
                                                Deliverance does not try to
                                                understand the semantics of
                                                applications, and instead
                                                expects them to provide
                                                appropriate
                                                <em>presentation</em> of
                                                whatever semantics the
                                                underlying application
                                                possesses. Presentation is more
                                                universal than semantics.

                                                While Deliverance does its best
                                                to work with applications
                                                as-they-exist, without making
                                                particular demands on those
                                                applications, it is not perfect.
                                                Conflicting CSS can be a serious
                                                problem. Some applications
                                                don&#8217;t have very good
                                                structure to work with. You
                                                can&#8217;t generate any content
                                                in Deliverance, you can only
                                                manipulate existing content, and
                                                often that means finding new
                                                ways to generate content, or
                                                making sure you have a place to
                                                store your content (as in the
                                                case of navigation). This is why
                                                arguably Deliverance does not
                                                <em>remove</em> the need for a
                                                platform, but is just its own
                                                platform. In so far as this is
                                                true, Deliverance tries to be a
                                                <em>better</em> platform, where
                                                &quot;better&quot; is &quot;more
                                                universal&quot; rather than
                                                &quot;more powerful&quot;. Most
                                                templating systems are more
                                                powerful than Deliverance
                                                transformations. It can be
                                                useful to have access to the
                                                underlying objects used to
                                                procude the markup. But
                                                Deliverance doesn&#8217;t give
                                                you these things, because it
                                                only implements things that can
                                                be applied to any source of
                                                content. Static files are
                                                entirely workable in
                                                Deliverance, just as any
                                                application written in Python,
                                                PHP, or even an application
                                                hosted on an entirely separate
                                                service is usable through
                                                Deliverance.

                                                As mentioned before, two
                                                important benefits of a platform
                                                are missing from Deliverance.
                                                I&#8217;ll try to describe what
                                                I believe are the essential
                                                aspects. I hope at some time
                                                that Deliverance or some
                                                complementary application will
                                                be able to satisfy these needs.
                                                Also, I suggest some lines of
                                                development that might be easier
                                                than others.

                                                    Typically each application
                                                    has a notion of what all the
                                                    interesting pages in that
                                                    application are. Most
                                                    applications have a set of
                                                    <em>uninteresting</em>
                                                    pages, or transient pages. A
                                                    search result is transient,
                                                    as an example. An
                                                    application also knows when
                                                    new pages appear, and when
                                                    other pages disappear. A
                                                    site-wide index of these
                                                    pages would allow things
                                                    like site maps,
                                                    cross-application search,
                                                    and cross-application

                                                    results are generally
                                                    boring. But a search result
                                                    based on a category might
                                                    still be interesting. The

                                                    be the sole entity allowed
                                                    to mark interesting pages.

                                                    somewhat inefficient, though

                                                    perhaps it would be fine.
                                                    But many applications want
                                                    very much to have a complete
                                                    record of all users.

                                                    not so easy to do something
                                                    like a subrequest.

                                                        it leaves the inner

                                                        application. If you want
                                                        to tweak something small
                                                        you will still need to
                                                        customize the template
                                                        of the application.

                                            We had a debate party tonight for
                                            the Biden-Palin debate. It&#8217;s
                                            nice to watch it in a group of
                                            like-minded people. Taking the
                                            Democrat/Republican debate seriously
                                            is a bullshit game and I don&#8217;t
                                            have any desire to bring this farce
                                            into my normal life.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            After the debate was over, I wanted
                                            to discuss the debate. After all,
                                            it&#8217;s weird to watch something
                                            for an hour and a half and then just
                                            ignore that we spent that time
                                            watching it. The problem is that I
                                            <em>hate</em> the punditry. No one
                                            actually said &quot;did Palin do
                                            what she had to do?&quot; (I
                                            probably would have screamed) but
                                            it&#8217;s just really
                                            <em>hard</em> not to talk about
                                            &quot;what will people think of this
                                            debate?&quot; And part of that is
                                            because we all know what
                                            <em>we</em> think. We saw through
                                            Palin deliberately ignoring the
                                            questions and reading her
                                            already-prepared speech. We all had
                                            a basic understanding of what is
                                            fact and what is a lie or
                                            misrepresentation. It&#8217;s nice
                                            to share little stories (like
                                            stories from the article about how

                                            >). But it&#8217;s so damn hard not
                                            to fall into a discussion about the
                                            horserace, about what other people
                                            will think. Why is it so hard to
                                            talk about what we think? Not what
                                            we analyze, but what we actually
                                            believe? Instead of predicting
                                            something that will come to pass
                                            regardless of our predictions,
                                            shouldn&#8217;t we be developing our
                                            own beliefs? That seems far more
                                            relevant to our lives.
                                        </p>

                                            There&#8217;s probably a lot of
                                            reasons for that. It&#8217;s
                                            intimidating to be entirely genuine,
                                            to speak without irony. And all the
                                            news is about the horserace, so we
                                            are all well informed, it makes it
                                            easy to talk.

                                            I think a large part of the problem
                                            is that the spectrum of opinions is
                                            so narrow (even if also bifurcated)
                                            that it&#8217;s hard to have an
                                            interesting discussion of political
                                            issues. Lacking anything of real
                                            substance to discuss, we discuss the
                                            discussion, we make predictions
                                            instead of forming real opinions.
                                            While I&#8217;m willing to blame
                                            many things on the Republicans, this
                                            is the product of both parties, of
                                            the narrow ignorance of
                                            &quot;conventional wisdom.&quot; For
                                            instance, the debate about the
                                            economic bailout has been rich with
                                            rhetoric but starved of any real
                                            ideas. I didn&#8217;t even realize
                                            how limited the debate was until I
                                            listened to

                                            well, we can do whatever we want.
                                            That is to say, we can actually make
                                            collective decisions about the
                                            direction of our economy, instead of
                                            the impotent position that is
                                            assumed in all current debates,
                                            where we can only poke lightly at
                                            the economy (and it&#8217;s implied
                                            anything more would destroy it).

                                            acceptable part of conventional
                                            wisdom. Socialized healthcare is the
                                            only reasonable option, but of
                                            course there&#8217;s lots of ways it
                                            could work, there&#8217;s lots of
                                            room for genuine and important
                                            discussion. But instead we have a

                                            In the end our own happiness is
                                            mostly in our own hands. The choices
                                            we make for ourselves are more
                                            significant than the choices made by
                                            the government (the choices we make
                                            collectively). But our collective
                                            choices do matter. We certainly
                                            haven&#8217;t figured out happiness.
                                            And maybe government does best when
                                            it has the least effect on our
                                            lives, but while that&#8217;s one
                                            end of the bifurcated conventional
                                            wisdom, as an idea it remains
                                            largely uninspected. When I consider
                                            many of the pleasant conveniences in
                                            my life, government is part of a lot
                                            of them. It doesn&#8217;t do much to
                                            make me more spiritually fulfilled,
                                            but the idea that government is a
                                            hopeless place to look for our
                                            collective happiness is a truism
                                            that lacks real consideration.

                                            Political discussion is stuck in a
                                            terrible intellectual rut. Blame
                                            falls equally on both parties. They
                                            hold on greedily to their monopoly
                                            of political thought. It&#8217;s
                                            like religious doctrine, something
                                            to which politicians must submit
                                            before being allowed to progress, a
                                            sign of submission to a larger
                                            system of power. I have this hope
                                            that Obama is going through the
                                            rites with discipline but without
                                            true belief, that he is being
                                            subversive, diving straight to the
                                            belly of the beast. But this is only
                                            speculation, perhaps a naive dream,
                                            a desire to project my hopes onto a
                                            figure of vague and general hope.

                                            I don&#8217;t really want to spend
                                            too much time discussing all the
                                            things that are wrong. This is the
                                            depressing comfort zone of the left.
                                            I want to talk about how things
                                            could be right, about how we can
                                            make a world that isn&#8217;t just
                                            less unjust but a world that is more
                                            beautiful, more wonderful, more full
                                            of life and freedom and passion. I
                                            want to exult in the potential of
                                            the future.

                                            out that much. Since then I&#8217;ve
                                            made three more minor releases of
                                            pyinstall, and I think the bundle
                                            support is working pretty decently.

                                            It&#8217;s not magical &#8212; it
                                            still has to compile the source and
                                            move the files around &#8212; but it
                                            does mean just a single download,
                                            and the versions of everything that
                                            is installed aren&#8217;t going to
                                            change unless that bundle file is

                                            I&#8217;ve been thinking about some
                                            other features for pybundles, like
                                            post installation scripts. All of
                                            this has raised a problem though:
                                            pyinstall needs to be a two-level
                                            command, with commands like:

                                            too late to rename the package (yet
                                            again), or just rename the script.
                                            Ideas?
