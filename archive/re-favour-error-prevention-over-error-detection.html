                >The Curse of the Despicable Dialogs</a
            >
            Mr Ed (<i
                >sigh... sometimes it's too hard to find people's full names</i
            >) gives a number of concrete suggestions about dialogs. They are
            mostly fine, but one of the suggestions really annoys me. For date
            input he suggests that of the three examples pictured, the third is
            the best (i.e., better to do date input with three select boxes).
            Maybe this wouldn't be <i>quite</i> so bad off the web, where you
            can allow both text input and drop-down entries. But having entered
            my birthyear several times in the last couple days using select box,
            this is just an incredibly stupid UI decision.

            <img
                src="http://www.hacknot.info/hacknot/images/posts/favour_error_prevention.jpg"
                align="right"
            />
        </p>

        <p>
            When I see select boxes in this context, I feel the programmer is
            being lazy and depending on the widgets do error detection. A
            similar situation is with phone-number fields, where people
            sometimes put in three text boxes for area code, phone number
            prefix, and then the last four numbers.
        </p>

        <p>
            In both cases, this isn't how people think of the data. A date is a
            single point in time, even though it is represented by three values
            (day, month, year). When you are entering a date the entire value
            should be entered, even if it that value is encoded in a structured
            manner. When you edit a date, it seldom works out that you'll only
            edit one of these fields.
        </p>

        <p>
            Besides programmer laziness, this is also a condescension upon the
            user. Can the user not read the instructions next to the input and
            figure out the format? Is the user incapable of writing a check or
            signing a document in real life, and they cannot be expected to have
            date-writing skills on computers?
        </p>

        <p>
            And while a calendar widget is ideal, the calendar widget should be
            like a filename widget -- you get a text box (which like a commenter
            said, supports copy-and-paste) and a "..." button for accessing the
            widget. (This is the default behavior for the oddly-named
            <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/jscalendar/"

        </p>

        <p>
            As I deal with more complex forms, especially related to data entry
            and databases, I feel more and more like free text is the best
            option, and that users should develop conventions and not try to
            encode every convention into the UI and data model. Often those
            conventions are short-sighted -- like the phone number fields, which
            won't support international numbers. If you have conscientious users
            and on-screen suggestions (like including <i>mm/dd/yyyy</i> next to
            your date input) you're doing your users a service.

            I completely agree with your points about the date combo - its an
            awful way to enter a date.
            <br />

            <br />
            We recently ditched a PHP/Javascript driven popup calendar in favour
            of a simple text box in a comercial web application of ours.
            <br />

            <br />
            The REAL benifit of the textbox is being able to allow your user to
            enter "english dates" (parsed using PHP's strtotime() function). Now
            our users can set appoints for "2pm next thursday" and search for
            items entered "last week" - much more intuative than having to dig
            around in a calendar for the right date.

            How about an objective comparison of the UIs? A reasonable standard
            (though not the only possible one) is to measure the number of
            actions a user must take to enter a value. Let's count them:
            <br />

            <br />
            First, your favorite:
            <br />
            Date [22/07/2004] (dd/mm/yyyy)
            <br />
            1. Tab into the field.
            <br />
            2. Type "2".
            <br />
            3. Type "2".
            <br />
            4. Type "/".
            <br />
            5. Type "0".
            <br />
            6. Type "8". (this is a typo... hey, nobody's perfect)
            <br />
            7. Realize mistake; type "Backspace".
            <br />
            8. Type "7".
            <br />
            9. Type "/".
            <br />
            10. Type "2".
            <br />
            11. Type "0".
            <br />
            12. Type "0".
            <br />
            13. Type "4".
            <br />

            <br />
            Now Mr Ed's preference:
            <br />
            Day [22]V Month [July]V Year [2004]V
            <br />
            1. Tab into field.
            <br />
            2. Click on day dropdown.
            <br />
            4. Move mouse to scrollbar.
            <br />
            5. Drag down the scrollbar.
            <br />
            6. Move mouse back up scrollbar.
            <br />
            7. Drag down the scrollbar again.
            <br />
            8. Click on "22".
            <br />
            9. Click on month dropdown.
            <br />
            10. Move mouse to scrollbar.
            <br />
            11. Drag down the scrollbar.
            <br />
            12. Click on "August". (drat! I hate making mistakes!
            <br />
            13. Click on month dropdown.
            <br />
            14. Move mouse to scrollbar.
            <br />
            15. Drag down the scrollbar.
            <br />
            16. Click carefully on "July".
            <br />
            17. Click on the year dropdown.
            <br />
            18. Move mouse to scrollbar.
            <br />
            19. Drag down scrollbar.
            <br />
            20. Click on "2004".
            <br />

            <br />
            Notice a difference? But really, I'm cheating here because when the
            UI professionals do this, they count "muscle movements", and so
            "Drag down scrollbar" would actually be three steps: "Press down on
            button; move mouse; let up on button". Which more accurately
            reflects the relative speed and ease of typing versus mousing. But
            then I'd have had to add at least 10 more steps and I was getting
            tired of typing.
            <br />

            <br />
            And if the text entry box were ever so slightly flexible it might
            suggest a "dd/mm/yyyy" format but *accept* single digits for month
            and day ("7" instead of "07") and two digit years ("04" instead of
            2004", with reasonable defaults for the century). Then the textbox
            would be only 8 muscle movements (or 10 with the "mistake").
            <br />

            <br />
            Don't use dropdowns for entering dates. Just don't. Really.
            <br />

            I think muscle movements also include a movement for key down and
            key up, so they both would actually have double that steps (though
            certainly that's a dull thing to write out). But having tried to use
            Raskin's LEAP, which he analytically justifies using these kind of
            metrics, I become highly suspicious of the metrics themselves;
            subjectively LEAP is crazy-hard to use.

            Your comment about phone number validation is spot on. I have had to
            resort to typing in random numbers to get past a screen that
            insisted on a US format number. In all probability if the
            organisation was going to phone me it would be a real person doing
            the dialing, so there is no need to have any form of validation. I
            have yet to see a validation routine that can handle:
            <br />
            "(+44)207 123 4567 ext. 1234 during UK office hours only, or (+44)
            7901 2345 6789
            <br />
            the rest of the time", but experienced phone users would have no
            problem.
            <br />

            Using plain text entry widgets in addition to a popup calendar also
            has the benefit of letting you copy and paste dates.

            <br />

            <br />
            Three values isn't quite how people think of a date either, to
            specify a date we also think of time differences (I'm going on
            holiday <i>in two days</i>), imminent days (tomorrow, next tuesday),
            and how often do you think
            "oh-two-slash-oh-one-slash-two-oh-oh-four"? A plain text box should
            support things like "January 1st, 3rd Feb" and be able to jump to a
            reasonable date.
            <br />

            <br />
            And that's besides the fact that in many cases people don't have a
            particular date in mind. Maybe we could have a "vague date" that
            could also hold nonspecific times like "next week", "before friday",
            "christmas", "in august" and so on. (But is that string really worth
            validating as a date then?)
