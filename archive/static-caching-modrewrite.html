                I put a static cache of my
                <a class="reference" href="ruby-python-power.html"
                    >Ruby/Python post</a
                >
                since it's been pretty popular and this blog software is very
                slow (among many of its flaws). I got it wrong at first and made
                it static regardless of what you tried to do, which mean that
                commenting was also broken (so that's why commenting
                stopped...). Anyway, here's the rule I ended up with:
            </p>
            <pre class="literal-block">
RewriteCond %{QUERY_STRING} ^$
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_METHOD} ^GET$
RewriteCond /home/blog/static_cache/%{REQUEST_URI} -s
RewriteRule (.*\.html)$ /home/blog/static_cache$1 [L]
</pre
            >
            <p>
                The idea is that only when there's no GET variables (the first
                rule), it is a GET request (not a POST; second rule), and file
                with that name exists on disk (third rule), then serve up that
                file, assuming it ends with
                <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">.html</span></tt
                >. (Incidentally, mod_rewrite actually applies the
                <tt class="docutils literal"
                    ><span class="pre">RewriteRule</span></tt
                >
                first, then applies the conditionals)
            </p>
            <p>Then I have a cron job that runs this script periodically:</p>
            <pre class="literal-block">
cd /home/blog/static_cache
for F in `cat /home/blog/static_cache_files.txt` ; do
  wget -q -O $F &quot;https://ianbicking.org/$F?nocache&quot;
done

                    Better would be to replace it with something faster. And
                    something that has anti-spam-protection features... These
                    spams are really annoying!

                        Yeah, yeah, that would require much more effort. It's so
                        hard to convert these damn things.

                        I also like threaded discussion, which is extremely
                        uncommon in blogging software. I think there's been some
                        really good discussion in the comments on this blog, and
                        that is much more manageable for all involved because of
                        threading.
                    </p>
                    <p>But yeah, the spam and crashing aren't fun :(</p>
