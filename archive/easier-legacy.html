                Changing blog software can be hard, as many of us now doubt
                know. In a

                >
                Bill de h√ìra discusses some of the issues exporting his existing
                blog to a new blog system. I know both the difficulty doing this
                sort of thing, the difficulties implementing it, and all the
                broken links left behind because of it. And it's all stupid. We
                can make things <em>much easier</em> if the people writing the
                software would just <em>let go</em> a little more and stop
                demanding that all the information go in some opaque (to the
                web) backend data silo (i.e., a database).
            </p>
            <p>
                For blogs the transition story <em>should</em> be much easier.
                When you want to retire your blogging software you should rip
                your site. Spider the whole thing down. It's not that much
                space, even when you have lots of redundant files.
            </p>
            <p>
                Of course, you probably can't serve the results up with Apache.
                Apache just... isn't good enough. For instance, your files may
                not have extensions; you have to keep some of the metadata, at
                least content type, and there's no clear way to do that in
                Apache. (There might be tricks or modules to do this in Apache,
                I'm not sure.) Also, the page names might be awkward, like
                <tt class="docutils literal"
                    ><span class="pre">/blog/?p=45</span></tt
                >
                -- Apache <em>interprets</em> that sort of stuff, and we don't
                want to interpret it, we spidered it as a page (irregardless of
                what <em>implements</em> that page), and we just want to serve
                it up as a page. That's it.
            </p>
            <p>
                But ignore the server portion for now -- we know we can build it
                if we want to. You now have an archive you can keep around
                forever and move to different hosts, and it doesn't rely on a
                software stack or any data formats except the one that matters
                most: the HTML that people read.
            </p>
            <p>
                But it's not perfect. You have a link like
                <tt class="docutils literal"
                    ><span class="pre">/blog/2005/07/my-post</span></tt
                >, or even
                <tt class="docutils literal"
                    ><span class="pre">/blog/?p=45</span></tt
                >. You new system has a link like
                <tt class="docutils literal"
                    ><span class="pre"
                        >/blog/2007/01/another-post.html</span
                    ></tt
                >. They both share
                <tt class="docutils literal"
                    ><span class="pre">/blog/</span></tt
                >
                -- you can configure your way around some (like
                <tt class="docutils literal"
                    ><span class="pre">^/blog/200[012345]/</span></tt
                >), but for how long? Must you only change blog software on new
                years day, or on the first of the month?
            </p>
            <p>
                When serving files you need a layered approach. First you look
                for this legacy content. If the content doesn't exist, you do
                the normal lookups, going to your new blogging software. The
                lookup must go to the full depth. That is, you don't look at
                <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">/blog</span></tt>
                and decide what to dispatch to. You look at
                <tt class="docutils literal"
                    ><span class="pre">/blog/?p=45</span></tt
                >
                (or whatever) and if you don't find it you start with the next
                option (the live software).
            </p>
            <p>
                Then you only have to worry about overlaps. And that's not
                without concern;
                <tt class="docutils literal"
                    ><span class="pre">/blog/archive/</span></tt
                >
                may in both systems. So some management may be necessary to
                rename or remove some of that legacy content.
            </p>
            <p>
                This is a good solution for content that is timely, or archival.
                If you have content that is not timely, you are probably using a
                CMS, and you really want to move the content into the new system
                so you can continue to manage it in a consistent way.
            </p>
            <p>
                In <em>that</em> case while it would be nice to keep URIs stable
                it might not be feasible. Which is why all stacks need easily
                managed redirects, with feedback taken from 404s in the logs.
            </p>
            <p>
                A system setup like this still has some problems. How do you
                show all the old entries as well as the new on your archive
                page? While I'm not terribly concerned about the styling of old
                pages, sensible navigation would be nice -- if you have archive
                links in your old pages, it will appear as though you've stopped
                posting (when in fact that's just the last date when the page
                was updated). And you want to do searches across all your
                content.
            </p>
            <p>
                These are also solvable problems, but they require some more
                significant changes. We need to move the data that is currently
                stored in the model out into the pages themselves. We need smart
                spidering, maybe building on Google Sitemaps or other
                enumerations of the &quot;interesting&quot; parts of a site. In
                addition notification of new content (by pushing out event
                notification, maybe in the form of
                <a
                    class="reference"
                    href="http://www.ietf.org/html.charters/atompub-charter.html"
                    >APP</a
                >). From there you could build an archive page entirely separate
                from the blog software, and capable of reading content from more
                than one location. Another more conservative option is just
                building some basic customizability into blog software so that
                you could copy the static HTML for your old archives, and the
                blog software would simply append this to the archive page.
            </p>
            <p>
                For styling and navigation I think a pipeline approach is most
                appropriate -- we're working on
                <a
                    class="reference"
                    href="http://openplans.org/projects/deliverance"
                    >Deliverance</a
                >
                to do this this, but it's a tricky problem. For searching...
                well, <em>that</em> at least is already easy; reasonable hints
                along with a third-part search service should work well (where
                &quot;reasonable hints&quot; includes not having your archive
                page indexed), and if a third-party search won't work then
                privately-hosted search services are still likely to be of
                higher quality than searches built into blog software.
            </p>
            <p>
                What annoys me is that technically none of this stuff is
                difficult (this is actually the <em>dumbest/easiest</em> way to
                handle legacy content), but existing stacks <em>make</em> it
                difficult. (I'm looking at you, Apache!) This kind of system
                design can be more stable than what we currently have, easier to
                maintain, more general, and just more <em>web</em>.
            </p>
            <p>
                This is the kind of stuff I'm trying to tackle with Paste and
                WSGI and all these little bits of code fitting together. I might
                just be tilting at windmills in the endeavor, as developers both
                young and old just <em>love</em> their backend models and want
                to have total control over everything (driven in no small part
                by over-controlling customers, graphic designers, marketers, and
                their ilk). And I can't really expect WSGI to take over the
                world; it's not going to be the next Apache. But
                <a class="reference" href="http://openplans.org">we</a> are
                definitely going to give some of this stuff a serious try.

                    This kind of simple HTTP based approach is definitely
                    showing a lot of promise. It significantly simplifies
                    scaling (look at Amazon's S3 service) but still leaves the
                    difficult problem of maintaining transactional integrity --
                    which is inherently difficult to scale -- for the active
                    part of your site.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We need to develop architectures that give us the easy
                    scalability of simple HTTP for the majority of our requests
                    while minimising that which is reliant on hard to scale
                    transactional systems. The alternative is ever larger
                    monolithic databases. Perhaps we can learn from Google.

                        Somewhat interestingly, WebDAV has this idea of
                        combining multiple requests (in an XML wrapper). The
                        intention there is to do the entire set of requests in a
                        transactional fashion. If you just have a way of
                        referring to a transactional context, you could then
                        explode that multirequest into a set of normal requests.
                        This doesn't work across multiple backends (without, I
                        suppose, some fancy transactional event system), but at
                        least it offers transactions on some compound
                        structures. (I've actually been thinking about this a
                        lot as it relates to
                        <a class="reference" href="http://pythonpaste.org/ohm/"
                            >OHM</a
                        >, as it's kind of an outstanding issue there.)

                    <p>
                        The other approach is to be sloppy, and to be ready to
                        deal with situations where the consistency of the system
                        has been compromised. This is much more practical when
                        you don't control all the pieces. Actually, it's about
                        the only thing that is practical when you don't control
                        all the pieces.
