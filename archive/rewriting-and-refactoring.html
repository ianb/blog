        <h1>Rewriting and Refactoring</h1>

        <div class="document">
            <p>
                I've been advocating lately to rewrite a CMS that
                <a class="reference" href="http://imagescape.com">we've</a>
                developed, to move it from Zope to Webware. For various reasons
                we developed it with Zope -- the previous version was in Zope,
                all the other development was done in Zope, and I didn't feel
                confident about my opinion on Zope. Having gone through the
                process, I now feel more confident -- it wasn't a disaster or
                anything, but ultimately I was just working around the
                environment, and the parameters of the development pretty much
                excluded the possibility of leveraging Zope (RDBMS persistence
                with static publishing). These are a few of my thoughts as I try
                to justify this... notes to myself, but I thought I'd share the
                thought process.
            </p>
            <p>
                So... the product is deployed and functional, and I've built
                various little workarounds to make due with the environment. But
                I know it could be a better product in the right environment
                (i.e., in a fully Pythonic environment). Because of the way it
                has been developed, changing environments would mean major
                reorganizing of the code (read: rewrite).
            </p>
            <p>
                Rewriting perfectly working code is a hard thing to justify.
                It's not even a cleanup -- I haven't sabotaged the code, and I
                haven't lazily let cruft collect, and even if I did cleanup
                would be a very bad justification for code I wrote myself. Or,
                if it's a cleanup, it's an architectural cleanup, which is
                vague, especially since it's not my architecture.
            </p>
            <p>
                I think there's two reasons to be suspicious of rewrites:
                <a
                    class="reference"
                    href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000069.html"
                    >it's risky</a
                >, and it can lead to
                <a
                    class="reference"
                    href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?SecondSystemEffect"
                    >second-system syndrome</a
                >.
            </p>
            <p>
                Joel's comments on the riskiness are really an accusation of
                hubris on the part of developers; where they confuse
                I-can't-understand-this with this-is-bad-code. There's other
                parts too, like there's a lot of knowledge contained in that
                code, and you may not recognize it or appreciate its effect on
                the product. Or, in his summary:
            </p>
            <blockquote>
                It's important to remember that when you start from scratch
                there is <strong>absolutely no reason</strong> to believe that
                you are going to do a better job than you did the first time.
                First of all, you probably don't even have the same programming
                team that worked on version one, so you don't actually have
                &quot;more experience&quot;. You're just going to make most of
                the old mistakes again, and introduce some new problems that
                weren't in the original version.
            </blockquote>
            <p>
                What does this say to me? It says: we must rewrite now! Because
                I <em>do</em> have more experience than the first team (which
                was a team made up of me). And if there's knowledge caught up in
                the code, that knowledge is also caught up in my brain.
                <em>If</em> this code needs a rewrite then it's best to do it
                quickly, because if I go then everything Joel says will be true
                about anyone who wants to rewrite it. (This is all the more
                complicated, because <em>this</em> version is itself a rewrite
                of someone else's work, so obviously I apply these ideas only
                when convenient :)
            </p>
            <p>
                So... it's not the rewrite Joel is talking about. Which leads us
                to the
                <a
                    class="reference"
                    href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second-system_effect"

                >:

                Designing the successor to a relatively small, elegant, and

                monstrosity.
            </blockquote>
            <p>
                This <em>is</em> a risk. And it's something I've done. My
                response to this is that we need to focus on one thing -- in
                this case the programming environment -- and resist making any
                other changes in the process. Which means no added features, no
                change in the database schema, no changes to the URL schemes or
                screen layout, and a very clear target: something that is
                indistinguishable from the current application. In reality there
                will be some changes, because I would revisit every piece of the
                system, and some parts are forgotten and changes will occur to
                me. But fixing those things isn't in the plan, and if I
                <em>realize</em> I'm doing that, then I've already spent too
                much time distracted from my main goal (reimplementation) and I
                should check myself.
            </p>
            <p>
                Sadly, this means that the resulting program will have no
                advantages over the original program. The time invested will
                seem like a waste from the outside. But then, that's always the
                nature of refactoring -- and even though this involves rewriting
                all the code, it's really just a kind of refactoring.
            </p>
            <p>
                It's still to be seen if I can actually convince them of this
                all...

            Are there any real benefits for the customer?

            <br />
            Perhaps it will decrease the implementation time for an upcoming
            feature or set of features? If so, then it becomes an easier sell.

            For the customer? No, benefit they could perceive (by design). This
            would have to be done as unbilled work. Which is possible, since
            this is an internally developed product, not something that belongs
            to a customer, and we aren't recouping costs on a service basis. Of
            course, if we wanted to sell more on the basis of service, this
            investment would allow a greater margin (if we bid).
            <br />

            <br />
            Thankfully I don't have to explain any of this to a customer, only
            to people in the company. That's part of the idea of packaged
            software, I guess: someone else does this thinking (and investment)
            for you, and you (the customer) don't have to consider things like
            development environments.

            One advantage of revisiting work, even if it isn't to rewrite it
            from scratch is that you can often make use of technologies that
            have arisen since. This can lead to the removal of code that you
            previously had to write yourself to get a job done, but can now
            utilise someone else's package to do.
            <br />

            <br />
            I've seen quite a lot of wheel reinventing in my time (and have
            probably done quite a bit myself), but I'm inclined to believe that
            shorter projects are better than longer projects if only because of
            the phenomenon described above - ie. you can make more
            dynamic/up-to-date technology decisions and can focus on only the
            most pertinent areas rather than committing yourself to writing lots
            of subsequently redundant code.

            What test suite you have? You can put new application against the
            old one, but that's too big granularity. And that also means you'll
            copy bug by bug.

            Fowler gets quite adamant these days about people calling tasks like
            this 'refactoring'. Refactoring is a very small and focused event.
            See
            <a
                href="http://www.martinfowler.com/bliki/RefactoringMalapropism.html"
                target="_blank"
                >Refactoring Malapropism</a
            >.
            <br />

            <br />
            At its heart, refactoring is about "improving the design of existing
            code," and should take no more than a few minutes according to
            Fowler. Completely changing the publishing environment and framework
            is a much bigger deal.
            <br />

            <br />
            Anyways, on projects like this, where there was a very small team,
            I've had good success with rewrites - they usually turn out smaller
            and more focused than the replaced system. I'm starting to realize
            that another benefit of Python is that its enabled me to always work
            in very small teams and still accomplish great things. This leaves
            many of us Python programmers isolated from the types of articles
            Joel writes, as they focus more on environments where larger teams
            are needed. (There's still wisdom to be gained from such articles,
            but I've always felt strange when they talk about team and company
            sizes).

            Maybe "foundational restructuring" would be a better term (since
            it's restructuring based on a change in the foundation/environment
            of the application -- and the rewrite falls out as a necessity, but
            in its essence it's a limited kind of restructuring.

            Don't forget that there *will* be improvements - on many of my
            perl-to-python rewrites, I've found things that could never have
            worked, done a little experimenting and confirmed that indeed, they
            hadn't, and fixed them as part of the rewrite. Some of this is
            purely due to paying new attention to the code - some of it, though,
            can be creditted to "explicit rather than implicit" and the way you
            expose certain things.
            <br />

            <br />
            This tricky part is not taking the temptation to improve beyond
            that. If you're being especially rigorous, the experimenting above
            goes in the test suite, to explicitly show what wasn't working
            before...
