                Starting a week, or I guess two weeks ago, I'll be spending 50%
                of my time on the
                <a class="reference" href="http://laptop.org"
                    >One Laptop Per Child</a
                >
                project in addition to my normal job at
                <a class="reference" href="http://topp.openplans.org"
                    >The Open Planning Project</a
                >. TOPP has been very generous and understanding about me
                splitting my time, and are actually funding my work for OLPC. I
                really like TOPP. But back to OLPC...
            </p>
            <p>
                What has been talked about
                <a
                    class="reference"
                    href="http://theploneblog.org/blog/archive/2006/09/05/one-python-per-child"
                    >only a little</a
                >
                (that I've seen) is how central Python is to the OLPC
                development. It's not the <em>most</em> exciting thing about the
                project (there's a lot of exciting things about the project),
                but it should be pretty exciting to the Python community, and
                probably the readers of this blog.
            </p>
            <p>
                The post I linked to called Python the &quot;application
                development language of choice&quot;. I think that's actually
                understating it. The laptop is very resource constrained (<a
                    class="reference"
                    href="http://wiki.laptop.org/go/Hardware_specification"
                    >current specs</a
                >
                are 128Mb RAM, 512Mb flash storage, and a 500MHz processor).
                There's not enough room to support lots of environments running
                simultaneously. Of course there's lots of C, and probably some
                C++ -- any compiled language with a small runtime would work
                fine. There's the shell, Javascript (in the browser), Smalltalk
                (in the form of
                <a class="reference" href="http://squeak.org">Squeak</a> and
                <a class="reference" href="http://www.squeakland.org/">EToys</a
                >), and then there's Python. And that's it.
            </p>
            <p>
                Most of the UI (called
                <a class="reference" href="http://wiki.laptop.org/go/Sugar"
                    >Sugar</a
                >) is being written in Python, and probably several other kinds
                of infrastructure are also going to be in Python.
            </p>
            <p>
                I'm not actually sure when or how this architectural decision
                was made. But I think it's a very reasonable decision; Python is
                at the right stage in its life for this project. It's a mature
                language and environment, there's quite a bit of knowledge about
                the environment spread out over a lot of communities (for
                example, it's pretty commonly used in Gnome, and for system
                management in Red Hat). Lots of people who use Python aren't
                part of the Python community, which is a good thing. It's free
                software, not just the language core but the vast majority of
                the libraries. It's relatively simple and safe to program in (we
                can't be introducing more buffer overflows). It is by design a
                very practical language and environment.
            </p>
            <p>
                I noted all the conservative reasons why someone would choose
                Python. OLPC is not a language development project. It isn't a
                framework development project. It isn't a technology project.
                It's an education project. When possible the technical choices
                should be conservative, so those reasons seem most important.
            </p>
            <p>
                The laptop design isn't very conservative. It's far less
                powerful than typical modern computers. Looking at this from the
                eyes of someone from several years ago, it's a great machine,
                but it seems pokey and small now. So we just need to readjust
                our expectations.
            </p>
            <p>
                But the hardware, as novel as it is, isn't the only atypical
                choice. For instance, OLPC won't have overlapping windows. (<a
                    class="reference"
                    href="http://www.modeemi.fi/~tuomov/ion/"
                    >I'm already a fan of that</a
                >.) All the UI will be trimmed back, not just because of
                resource limitations but because these computers need to be easy
                to use. Very easy to use: not only are they given to children,
                there won't necessarily be anyone more experienced around to
                help with things (except online).
            </p>
            <p>
                And who needs a word processor when you don't have a printer?
                Who needs an Excel-compatible spreadsheet program when you don't
                know anyone who uses Excel? Especially when you are 8 years old.
                It's the most un-enterprisey system possible.
            </p>
            <p>
                It's these novel system, software, and UI decisions that really
                excite me. More about that later...

                        I think it would be a very bad idea if it meant that
                        non-bugfix additions to Python 2 were going to stop. But
                        it doesn't mean that -- the stated plan is actually to
                        backport as much from Python 3 to Python 2 as possible,
                        where it doesn't break backward compatibility (e.g., the
                        IO layer changes are not at all portable, but things
                        like generic functions or better string formatting are).
                        So Python 2 still has a lot of life in it.

                    transfer well / easily to other portable devices? Perhaps
                    there's GUI framework work that's transferable, for example?

                        There's certainly transfer that will happen. Lots of the
                        people involved are active in their respective non-OLPC
                        communities. One of the things that's been mentioned
                        most is performance work, particularly getting
                        applications to just quiet down, and keeping them from
                        waking up periodically. Since the laptop is supposed to
                        go into suspend fairly quickly, and come out quite
                        quickly as well, we don't want the laptop to wake up
                        because some application or library is polling for
                        something to happen.
