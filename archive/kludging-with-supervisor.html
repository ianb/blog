                For some reason the Trac instance I have running under
                <a
                    class="reference"
                    href="http://svn.pythonpaste.org/Paste/TracPaste/trunk"
                    >TracPaste</a
                >
                crashes regularly. I suspect it's some problem with SQLite
                (3.2.8?), or Subversion, or something that leaks file
                descriptors.
            </p>
            <p>
                My lame workaround is now in place using
                <a
                    class="reference"
                    href="http://www.plope.com/software/supervisor"
                    >supervisor</a
                >
                from Chris McDonough, a monitor (similar to
                <a class="reference" href="http://cr.yp.to/daemontools.html"
                    >daemontools</a
                >) that will restart a process when it dies. (I could also have
                used daemontools itself, or
                <a
                    class="reference"
                    href="http://cvs.zope.org/Packages3/zdaemon/"
                    >zdaemon</a
                >
                I suppose, I'm not sure what the best system will be.)
            </p>
            <p>Here's the config I use:</p>
            <pre class="literal-block">
&lt;program trac&gt;
  command /home/trac/bin/paster serve /home/trac/data/apps.ini
  auto-start true
  logfile /home/trac/var/paste-trac.log
&lt;/program&gt;
</pre

            <p>
                I was able to install it locally to the user, but had to
                <a
                    class="reference"
                    href="http://www.plope.com/software/collector/23"
                    >tweak things a little</a
                >. Anyway, seems to work okay.
            </p>
            <p>
                I still have to tweak the login screens, but the new
                installations of Trac now support (and require)
                <a class="reference" href="http://openid.net/">Open ID</a>
                authentication, using the support in Paste. You can get
                <a
                    class="reference"
                    href="http://www.lifewiki.net/openid/OpenIDServers"
                    >free Open ID signups</a
                >, (<a class="reference" href="http://videntity.org/"
                    >videntity</a
                >
                looks like the nicest) so the plan is to use those and not worry
                about any user database in the Trac installs themselves. You end
                up being identified as a URL as a result -- a more refined
                system would let you associate a real name and email address
                with the URL. But simple integration with Trac is much easier
                when there's no extra data. I'm also interested in videntity's
                <a class="reference" href="http://microformats.org/wiki/hcard"
                    >hCard</a
                >
                support, and maybe just relying on that.
            </p>
            <p>
                Once I feel a little more comfortable with the system (and maybe
                even keep it from crashing constantly) I'll try to move to the
                instances I set up in trac.sqlobject.org and
                trac.formencode.org.

                    with some small tweaks (e.g., better usage messages), and a

                        Thanks for the note; there's some good ideas in DJB's
                        stuff, but the licensing and packaging hobbles it.
