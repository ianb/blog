        <h1>Movie: Whale Rider</h1>

        <div class="document">
            <p>
                I saw
                <a class="reference" href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0298228/"
                    >Whale Rider</a
                >
                tonight. I was most unimpressed. Yet another movie about a
                native people struggling to hold on to their tradition while
                resolving its conflict with the modern world. Yawn.
            </p>
            <p>
                It's damned hard to tell the difference between this kind of
                movie when it features Maori, American Indian, or any other
                native people -- or heck, it could be talking about Italians,
                Irish, Appalachian, or any other quaint ethnicity. Oh, this one
                had whales, and the particular chants and dances showed off the
                richness of the Maori culture.
            </p>
            <p>
                I couldn't help but compare it to
                <a class="reference" href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0285441/"
                    >The Fast Runner</a
                >
                (also called <em>Atanarjuat</em>), which was a much better
                movie. That movie, instead of being yet another
                modern-world-meets-traditional-values, was a straight up movie
                about the Inuit, with no modern culture at all (it was based on
                a traditional tale, placed before any Western influence). I
                believe that's the first movie of its kind I've ever seen, which
                seems very odd. Were there no stories worth repeating in these
                cultures before modern influences? Would it be that hard to make
                one up?
            </p>
            <p>
                This might be because The Fast Runner was written, produced, and
                directed entirely by native people, unlike Whale Rider and
                <em>every other movie</em> about native people (yes,
                <em>all</em> of them!) In so many others there seems to be this
                lack of imagination, leading to the same story being told over
                and over again. That might be unsurprising: if everything is
                produced by outsiders, who look in on these cultures as charming
                and quaint, trivially unique, will they really be able to tell
                stories that are representative of these cultures?
            </p>
            <p>
                Part of annoyance with Whale Rider might be from my lack of
                appreciation for the outward traditions of those cultures. The
                chants, songs, ceremonial dress, etc. -- to me those seem like
                the most trivial, most petty aspect of the cultures. A good
                story should give a picture of more than the physical trappings
                of a culture. That's the difference between a story and a museum
                display. Whale Rider was just a very pretty museum display.

                    I think you missed the whole thrust of this incredible
                    movie, based on a novel written by a Maori novelist. If you
                    are looking for a culture completely separated from the
                    world, there are fewer and fewer place that will meet your
                    needs. How communities engage in the world around them is
                    certainly an interesting topic to me. In addition, there
                    were deep philosophical elements involved in this movie.
                    What is truth? How is truth discovered? What role does
                    tradition serve in discerning the truth. Does truth evolve?
                    The girl represents a post-modern conception truth,
                    embracing tradition, but realizing that truth can be
                    discovered in new ways to new generations. Anyway, my two
                    cents.
