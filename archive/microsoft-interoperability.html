            <p>
                I really have little passion one way or the other for Microsoft.
                I don't hate them. I suspect that is because (at least as a
                programmer) I interact with the company and its products very
                little. What a pleasant cocoon for me.
            </p>
            <p>
                At my
                <a class="reference" href="http://imagescape.com">work</a> we're
                putting together a proposal for a client. They have a Microsoft
                <a
                    class="reference"
                    href="http://www.microsoft.com/BusinessSolutions/RetailManagementSystem"
                    >point of sale system</a
                >, and part of the job would be integrating the online site with
                that system. Not something we have a lot of experience with, but
                I figure it should be doable. They mention
                <a
                    class="reference"
                    href="http://www.microsoft.com/BusinessSolutions/RetailManagementSystem/rms_storeoperations.aspx#Integrate"
                    >integration</a
                >
                in the materials, and other systems can integrate with it. The
                one ecommerce system we looked at was absolutely horrid, but
                that's promising -- if whatever class of programmer that builds
                such a system can manage the integration, surely we can do it!
            </p>
            <p>
                So, I filled out a contact request with Microsoft, asking about
                any materials about integration and this system. We just want to
                know if it's feasible, a hint at how hard this might be. I don't
                really know what I was expecting from Microsoft; I did it more
                out of due diligence than any optimism on my part. But they
                called me back in an hour or so, which is very prompt of them.
            </p>
            <p>
                The guy must have been looking at our website while he talked to
                us (they asked for our URL was part of the contact form),
                because as the conversation continues he starts addressing the
                specific technologies we use (Unixy stuff). I kind of expected
                he might say that, well, this sort of information and guidance
                requires a support contract, or an MSDN account, or something
                like that -- fine, I can live with that answer, phone calls
                aren't free, and I don't have any illusions about Microsoft
                being as transparent about their software as I expect to be with
                mine.
            </p>
            <p>
                But that wasn't what he said -- to paraphrase him,
                <em
                    >Microsoft isn't in the business of integrating with
                    non-Microsoft software.</em
                >
                Anyway, I just found it ironic that this guy didn't
                <a
                    class="reference"
                    href="http://management.silicon.com/itpro/0,39024675,39127619,00.htm"
                    >pretend</a
                >
                like he was supposed to.

                <p>
                    Up until two some odd years ago I was a walking MSFT
                    billboard, metaphorically speaking with respect to my
                    career. The company I co-founded was a boutique consultancy
                    focussing on document management and workflow solutions for
                    larger businesses and government, for the most part
                    exclusively using Microsoft technologies at the back end and
                    in the core. Prior to that I'd worked for a mid-sized, once
                    larger sized, systems vendor (Data General) and thus had
                    some unix-ey background. Before that with Computer
                    Associates and thus had both PC and Mainframe background.
                </p>

                    Back to Microsoft - they are not much help even when you are
                    supposedly joined at the hip, at least not unless you are a
                    targeted big consulting company or strategic end-user.
                    Having personal contacts works, as it always does, but aside
                    from that I always hated having to deal with them - even
                    more than most companies hated to deal with Computer
                    Associates!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Back in my DG days we started to try to get to know them -
                    Windows NT was on the rise, and it made sense to do so since
                    our market was the real enterprise and we knew we'd be
                    seeing them everywhere. Microsoft were difficult then, quite
                    sure of the promise NT Server offered. Too bad Novell and/or
                    some Unix vendor didn't make file system management
                    point-and-click friendly back then or it would be a
                    different world, I bet.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Just the same, Microsoft should clean up their act in the
                    near future. Now, I believe, they will increasingly be under
                    pressure.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'm sure there are more and more organizations willing to
                    venture away from the supposedly tried and true. Open Source
                    is not any longer the new kid on the block, and for many the
                    advantages are worth seeking out actively. Why would I trade
                    - if I have a choice - working with systems where help is
                    but a source code file away, or from many thousands of users
                    (and at least dozens or hundreds of actually knowledgable
                    users) - for a closed source &quot;solution&quot; which more
                    often than not gets in my way?
                </p>
                <p>
                    My sense is that the various open source pieces needed to
                    replace Microsoft at the server level are quite well
                    advanced. The knowledge level in corporate and vendor IT and
                    architecture is a little less advanced but due to gain with
                    each new class of developer graduating.
                </p>
                <p>
                    What's really holding larger migration back is the packaged
                    software vendors - and corporate development shops to a
                    large but slightly lesser degree - which have for too-long
                    simply opted for Microsoft tools for safety. Seen lots of
                    horror stories of shops that drank the Microft Koolaid even
                    though their Spidey-sense was tingling. Not to suggest that
                    all their tools and technologies are crap - but they tend to
                    believe there is only one-true-way and its their-way, even
                    though common sense says it can't possibly be that cut and
                    dried.

                    Your experience clearly dug up some memories for me! I found
                    them irritating when I was still involved with my company,
                    and a MSFT Solutions Partner. Now I'm glad to have only one
                    Windows machine left... never to be upgraded if I can
                    possibly help it.
