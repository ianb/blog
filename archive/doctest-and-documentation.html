</div><h1>Doctest and documentation</h1>
 <p>

<a href="http://python.org/doc/current/lib/module-doctest.html"><tt>doctest</tt></a>
(<a href="http://www.python.org/pycon/dc2004/papers/4/">see also this
presentation</a>) is a very clever way to do Python testing.
Especially for smaller, highly decoupled functions doctest is
wonderfully easy to develop for.  However, it can be a bit of a pain
-- it is extremely literal.  It expects the output to be
<i>exactly</i> what you say it will be, down to the smallest bit of
whitespace.  I think this sucks.

<p>

This is justified with the idea that doctest tests are documentation
as well as tests.  The documentation should be completely correct, and
people shouldn't be surprised when they try the examples out themselves.

<p>

This does not give the reader the credit they deserve.  Readers are
highly capable of understanding that there are imporant aspects to
documentation, and there are incidental aspects.  In
<tt>&lt;SomeObject instance at 0x401edc0c&gt;</tt> it's pretty easy to
figure out that <tt>0x401edc0c</tt> is not an important value.  The <a href="http://python.org/doc/current/lib/node140.html">accepted</a> way
to deal with this is to make sure such a value never gets printed.
This also applies to <i>all</i> dictionaries, which have an
unpredictable key order, and output that includes newlines, which
doctest can't parse.


<p>

Another suggestion in <a href="http://www.python.org/pycon/dc2004/papers/4/note23.html">future
directions for doctest</a> (from the presentation) is that there be a
series of pretty-printers that display values in a canonical form,
removing addresses, ordering dictionary keys, etc.

<p>

This is absolutely the wrong idea if you are creating documentation.
Those explicit pretty printers or funny expressions (like <tt>foo() ==
{"Hermione": "hippogryph", "Harry": "broomstick"}</tt>, as opposed to
printing the output of <tt>foo()</tt>) are a distraction.  This is
fine if you are using doctest as a unittest replacement (which is a
valid way to avoid unittest's verbosity), but it's no good in
documentation.

<p>

I think instead that doctest should support both pluggable pretty
printers -- pretty printers that aren't explicitly invoked in test
expressions -- and that there also be pluggable string equality
functions.  (Actually I'm unsure about the pretty printers, but very
sure about the string equality functions.)

<p>

For instance, I have a bunch of code that tests HTML output.  I don't
care about the order of the attributes, so I have a function that
parses the HTML and ignores attribute order.  That this happens
magically behind the scenes doesn't bother me for documentation -- I
expect my readers to ignore the same details that the equality
function ignores.  I don't want to use some alternate way to represent
HTML -- I <i>don't</i> expect the readers to understand some funny
nested structure.  And the entire point of the narrative form of
doctest is defeated if I use the equality function explicitly, because
my output becomes meaningless while all information is stored in the
expressions.  That's awkward and ugly.

<p>

In other cases, people may be using floats but aren't concerned with
the fact that binary-encoded floats are unpredictable (e.g.,
<tt>1.9</tt> is displayed as <tt>1.8999999999999999</tt>).  This
detail about float implementations matters a lot in some
circumstances, but it should be up to the documentation author
whether they want to highlight that difference.  For this case an
equality test might look like:

<pre>
def floatEqual(s1, s2):
    try:
        return float(s1) == float(s2)
    except ValueError:
        return False
</pre>

<p>

Wildcards are another useful way to highlight the interesting part of
the output.  I've used <tt>...</tt> as a wildcard that's
documentation-friendly, so you might use the output <tt>&lt;SomeObject
instance at ...&gt;</tt>.

<p>

I played with some of these ideas in <a href="http://colorstudy.com/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/trunk/DataTest/datatest/doctesthacks.py?rev=34&view=markup">doctesthacks</a>
which, as the name implies, is a bit of a hack.  Unfortunately doctest
wasn't designed to be modified in this way.

<p>

(I was reminded of these testing issues after reading about <a href="http://weblog.hotales.org/view/python/2004/08/07/0">std.utest</a>,
which is a unittest alternative.)
