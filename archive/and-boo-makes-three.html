        <h1>And Boo Makes Three</h1>
        <p>
            I just came upon <a href="http://boo.codehaus.org/">Boo</a>, a CLI
            (.NET) language. It's statically typed, but the syntax is based on
            Python. With
            <a href="http://www.cosc.canterbury.ac.nz/~greg/python/Pyrex/"
                >Pyrex</a
            >
            and <a href="http://www.prothon.org/">Prothon</a>, that makes three
            recent languages inspired by Python.
        </p>

        <p>
            The
            <a href="http://boo.codehaus.org/BooManifesto.pdf">manifesto</a>
            (PDF, ick) seems like the best description of the language.
        </p>

        <ol>
            <li>
                Timespan and regular expression literals. (Timespan seems like a
                weird choice)
            </li>

            <li>
                String interpolation, like <tt>"Hello \$name!"</tt>. Only in
                double-quote strings, not single-quote. I find that very
                annoying, the equivalence of these quotes in Python is a good
                feature. I've cursed PHP for this. Maybe in shell this makes
                sense, but not in a normal language.
            </li>

            <li>Statically typed. <b>But...</b></li>

            <li>
                Type inference, so you don't have to declare types too often,
                unless you want to. Of course, you need all your code bundled up
                before hand to do inference, where Python only looks at code on
                an on-demand basis. But in practice all the code is usually
                available.
            </li>

            <li>
                Variables are somewhat casually declared. Whenever you first use
                a variable, use <tt>as type</tt> to indicate the type (if
                necessary). Like <tt>def func(a as int, b as str)</tt>.
            </li>

            <li>
                Duck typing, i.e., Python's typing (if it looks like a duck and
                quacks like a duck, it must be a duck). When you really don't
                care about type signatures.
            </li>

            <li>
                Syntactic attributes. I don't fully understand the mechanism
                here, but it's a lot like Python's decorators, and uses the
                proposed syntax for decorators. I think it might be a little
                more general than descriptors, perhaps in part because it may
                work at compile time.
            </li>

            <li>
                Macros. They seem very complicated to implement, but basically
                you can manipulate the compilation, inserting your own
                transformation into the process. I don't know if this causes
                problems with debuggability -- debuggability is frequently a
                feature left out of languages in the early days, when it should
                be a major concern. If used sparingly, this could be a nice
                feature. (I bet you could make lazy introspectable expressions
                this way!)
            </li>

            <li>
                Some minor things. <tt>print</tt> is a function. Assignment is
                an expression (like <tt>if (var = func()) is not None:</tt>). It
                doesn't use <tt>self</tt> in method signatures <i>or</i> method
                bodies. Instance variables become local variables. I don't mind
                the signature bit, but I like using <tt>self.attr</tt> for
                instance variables. <tt>finally:</tt> is called <tt>ensure:</tt>
            </li>
        </ol>

        <p>
            Prothon also had another release just a week ago. The
            <a
                href="http://www.prothon.org/viewcvs/prothon/trunk/CHANGES.txt?rev=711&view=markup"
                >changes</a
            >
            all seem pretty good -- lots of little syntactic nits in Python are
            corrected. E.g., default values for function parameters are
            evaluated when the function is called.
        </p>

            Having skimmed the manifesto briefly, there doesn't seem to be much
            about classes and inheritance, and the type inference section on the
            site is tantalisingly missing. However, the existence of decorators
            and macros should fuel the debate about their introduction into
            standard Python, and I could imagine the Twisted people finding the
            asynchronous stuff of interest.

            Great stuff. Especially the type declarations and type inference...
            it can prove to be educational for cpython as well.
            <br />

            <br />
            There are some perlistic warts (regex and timespan literals,
            dostuff() while foo()), but I assume they will be removed as the
            project matures.
            <br />

            <br />
            This project might benefit from some co-operation with IronPython...

            In skimming through the example code, I felt that this was more a
            "terse C#", rather than Pythonesque or similar..maybe it was just
            the lack of duck typing and peppered attributes. More palitable to
            see as an easier C#, and I'm used to the Pythonic view of C# as
            wordy.
            <br />

            <br />
            The Python acknowledgement and documentation humor are appreciated.
            Thanks for the thorough technical review.

            OSNews reports that IronPython a .Net dynamic language has been open
            sourced here. What it doesn't mention is that its creator has joined
            the MS CLR team as reported a little bit further down here:
