                                    Some of the questions raised: are we
                                    destroying cultures? If so, what can we do
                                    about it? Must we be hands off? I will add
                                    these questions: is it patronizing to make
                                    these choices for other people, no matter
                                    how enlightened we try to be? How much
                                    change is inevitable? Can we help make the
                                    change positive instead of resisting change?

                                    community is pretty slim, for example.
                                    Introducing the internet into a community
                                    will lead the children to favor Spanish more
                                    strongly, and identify with that more

                                <p>Criticisms like Guido&#8217;s are common:</p>

                                        I&#8217;m not surprised that the pope is
                                        pleased by the OLPC program. The
                                        mentality from which it springs is the
                                        same mentality which in past centuries
                                        created the missionary programs. The
                                        idea is that we, the west, know
                                        what&#8217;s good for the rest of the
                                        world, and that we therefore must push
                                        our ideas onto the &quot;third
                                        world&quot; by means of the most
                                        advanced technology available. In past
                                        centuries, that was arguably the
                                        printing press, so we sent missionaries
                                        armed with stacks of bibles. These days,
                                        we have computers, so we send modern
                                        missionaries (of our western lifestyle,
                                        including consumerism, global warming,
                                        and credit default swaps) armed with

                                    This kind of criticism is easy, because it
                                    doesn&#8217;t have any counterproposal.
                                    It&#8217;s not saying much more than
                                    &quot;you all suck&quot; to the people
                                    involved.

                                    Cultural imperialism is a genuine phenomena.
                                    In an attempt to subjugate or assimilate,
                                    the dominant culture may explicitly and
                                    cynically enforce its cultural norms,
                                    through its religion, requiring all schools
                                    to operate in the dominant language, even
                                    going as far as

                                    But it&#8217;s not clear to me that
                                    what&#8217;s happening now is cultural
                                    imperialism. It&#8217;s more market-oriented
                                    homogenization. Food manufacturers
                                    don&#8217;t use high-fructose corn syrup
                                    because they want to make us fat &#8212;
                                    they just give us what we want, and they are
                                    enabling our latent tendency to become
                                    obese. Similarly I think the way culture is
                                    spread currently encourages homogeneity,
                                    without explicit attempting to destroy
                                    culture.

                                    This is where I think a protectionist stance
                                    &#8212; the idea we should just be hands-off
                                    &#8212; is patronizing. People aren&#8217;t
                                    abandoning their cultures because they are
                                    stupid and they are being manipulated.
                                    People make decisions, what they think is
                                    the best decision for themself and their
                                    families. These decisions lead them to leave
                                    rural areas, learn the dominant language,
                                    try to conform through education, and even
                                    just lead them to enjoy a dominant culture
                                    which is often far more entertaining than a
                                    smaller and more traditional culture.

                                    The irony is that once they&#8217;ve done
                                    this they&#8217;ve traded their position for
                                    a place in the bottom rung of the dominant
                                    society. And it&#8217;s true that in many
                                    cases they&#8217;ve made these decisions
                                    because they&#8217;ve been forced out of
                                    their traditional life by political and
                                    legal systems they don&#8217;t understand.
                                    But to blame it all on oppression is to be
                                    blind to the many concrete benefits of our
                                    modern world. Corrugated metal roofs are
                                    simply superior to thatched roofs, and we
                                    can get all romantic about traditional
                                    building processes and material
                                    independence, but we do so from homes with
                                    roofs that don&#8217;t leak. Leaking roofs
                                    are just objectively unpleasant. And frankly
                                    people like TV, you don&#8217;t have to
                                    <em>tell</em> people to like TV, it just
                                    happens.

                                    So I believe that assimilation pressure is
                                    natural and inevitable in our times.

                                    What then of technology, of the internet and
                                    laptops?

                                    I believe OLPC takes an important stance
                                    when it selects open source and open
                                    licensing for its content. It is valuing
                                    freedom, but more importantly encouraging
                                    self-determination, trying to build up a
                                    user base that can act as peers in this
                                    project, not as simply receivers of
                                    first-world largess. But it will be
                                    culturally disruptive. And I&#8217;m okay
                                    with that. In a patriarchal culture, giving
                                    girls access to this technology will be
                                    destructive to that power structure. Yay! I
                                    believe in the moral rightness of that one
                                    girl making her own choices, finding her own
                                    truths, more than I believe in the validity
                                    of the culture she was born into. If you
                                    believe people should be able to make their
                                    own choices (so long as they are aware of
                                    the real consequence of their choices), then
                                    you must allow for them to choose to abandon
                                    their own cultures for something they find
                                    more appealing. They might know better than
                                    you if that&#8217;s a good choice. I think
                                    we all hope that instead they
                                    <em>transform</em> their own cultures, but
                                    that&#8217;s not our choice to make.

                                    true identity to find themselves in a place
                                    of cultural subservience. If they feel they
                                    can&#8217;t preserve the part of their
                                    culture they most value. Perhaps because of
                                    discrimination they feel they must hide
                                    their past, or they build up a sense of
                                    self-loathing. Perhaps they become isolated,
                                    unable to find peers that understand where
                                    they come from. And perhaps there is no
                                    higher culture at all that they can use to
                                    exalt their understanding of the world
                                    &#8212; do they have a literature? Do they
                                    have non-traditional music forms of their
                                    own? Do they have a forum where people who
                                    share their perspective can have serious
                                    discussions? Cultures aren&#8217;t destroyed
                                    so much as they are starved out of
                                    existence.

                                    I think assimilation is inevitable, and can
                                    be positive. If we were all able to speak to
                                    each other, with some shared second or third
                                    language, I think the world would be a
                                    better place. I&#8217;m not a Christian, but
                                    I&#8217;m not afraid of anyone knowing The
                                    Bible. There&#8217;s no piece of culture
                                    that I would want to deny from anyone. Each
                                    new song, each new book, each new
                                    idea&#8230; I believe they will all make you
                                    a better person, if only in a small way.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    And on the internet our culture is
                                    cumulative. There&#8217;s only so many hours
                                    of programming on TV or the radio, only so
                                    many pages in a newspaper. On the internet
                                    the presence of one kind of culture does not
                                    exclude any other. There&#8217;s room for a
                                    Quechua community as much of any other. But
                                    the online Quechua community won&#8217;t
                                    have exclusive rights to its members like a
                                    traditional culture claims &#8212; children
                                    will live between cultures.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Cumulative culture is not a promise that
                                    anyone will care. Languages can still die,
                                    cultures can still die, identities become
                                    forgotten. If these smaller cultures are
                                    going to be preserved, they must adapt to
                                    the partially-assimilated status of their
                                    members. There must be new art and new ideas
                                    and new identities. This is why I believe in
                                    the laptop project, because it can enable
                                    the creation and sharing of these new ideas.
                                    I think it will give smaller cultures a
                                    chance to survive &#8212; there&#8217;s no
                                    promises, literature doesn&#8217;t write
                                    itself, but maybe there is at least a
                                    chance.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    This is also why I am more skeptical of
                                    mobile phones, audio devices, and any device
                                    that doesn&#8217;t actively enable content
                                    creation. Mobile phones are not how culture
                                    is made. It let&#8217;s people chat, consume
                                    information, communicate in a 12-key pidgin.
                                    But the mobile phone user is not a peer in a
                                    world wide web of information. The mobile
                                    phone user lives on a proprietary network,
                                    with a proprietary device, and while it
                                    perhaps it breaks down some hierarchies
                                    through disintermediation, it does so in a
                                    transient way. The uptake is certainly
                                    faster, but the potential seems so much
                                    lower.
                                </p>

                                    I don&#8217;t know if OLPC will be
                                    successful. That&#8217;s as unclear now as
                                    ever. But it&#8217;s trying to do the right
                                    thing, and I think it&#8217;s a better
                                    chance than most for maintaining or
                                    improving the richness of the worlds&#8217;
                                    culture.

                                    <p>
                                        I think it is too easy to take for
                                        granted the basic quality of life we
                                        have and the immense mental freedom of
                                        having most information at our finger
                                        tips and having the time to use it.
                                        However, this seems to bring with it the
                                        disgust at what our own culture, what we
                                        ourselves are doing with it.<br />
                                        I can see Guido point in this regard,
                                        but I think he confuses the “religion”
                                        of consumerism and void this brings with
                                        the basics of what can make an
                                        individuals life better. Very few are
                                        lucky enough to sit down and enjoy
                                        making a programming language.<br />
                                        Poor countries need very very boring
                                        things like infrastructure, auditing and
                                        a civil service so people can have these
                                        freedoms. These things normally require
                                        a “logical head” to do, which you can
                                        find people anywhere if given the
                                        opportunity. However these things are
                                        rarely encouraged. I believe these
                                        things go with any culture also. But
                                        having a “logical head” normally equates
                                        with money and money on to consumerism
                                        and consumerism to our homogeneous
                                        culture. However, these things do not
                                        equate in any way. They only equate
                                        because our culture seems to be failing,
                                        not necessarily others given the same
                                        opportunities.<br />
                                        We need them to be able to share theirs
                                        to make ours better.

                                        A while ago (several years) I saw a show
                                        on TV where this guy (researcher or
                                        maybe a linguist?) was going around the
                                        UK and Ireland and making recordings of
                                        old myths and stories in the original
                                        languages, specifically Welsh and
                                        Gaelic. The reason was that even though
                                        the stories were &#8220;known&#8221;,
                                        the original oral traditions were
                                        dieing. I believe several native
                                        american tribes have been doing the same
                                        thing.
                                    </p>

                                        A good example of technology helping to
                                        preserve culture.

                                        Note: I believe this was part of the
                                        &#8220;Joseph Campbell and the Power of
                                        Myth&#8221; series with Joesph Campbell
                                        and Bill Moyers. Though it may have been
                                        in his earlier work
                                        &#8220;Mythos&#8221;, or it could have
                                        been someone completely different ;-)

                                        Ian: &#8220;In a patriarchal culture,
                                        giving girls access to this technology
                                        will be destructive to that power
                                        structure. Yay! I believe in the moral
                                        rightness of that one girl making her
                                        own choices, finding her own truths,
                                        more than I believe in the validity of
                                        the culture she was born into.&#8221;
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        I believe that statement alone forms a
                                        succinct and sufficient reply to Guido.
                                        I&#8217;ll go further and say that
                                        &#8220;destruction of culture&#8221; is
                                        almost universally a positive thing.
                                        Look at the precious culture
                                        that&#8217;s been lost by the widespread
                                        removal of monarchies. Or the lost
                                        culture in northern India if
                                        dowry-related killings and burnings
                                        became a thing of the past. Or the
                                        culture America would lose if it stopped
                                        turning a blind eye to the (profitable)
                                        incarceration of millions of non-violent
                                        citizens, let alone their subsequent
                                        disenfranchising in some areas. What
                                        proportion of living native Americans
                                        think it&#8217;s okay to murder members
                                        of other tribes, compared to 300 years
                                        ago?
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        I think, under sufficient examination
                                        and with a couple exceptions, cultural
                                        norms tend to be horrifying to a degree
                                        roughly proportional to their age. The
                                        common theme here isn&#8217;t their
                                        &#8220;transformation&#8221;, it&#8217;s
                                        their gradual disappearance as humanity
                                        slowly figures out how not to be jerks
                                        to be each other.

                                            <p>
                                                I don&#8217;t know that I
                                                believe the culture deserves
                                                <em>simply</em> to die off. That
                                                culture is like parents, and
                                                even bad parents are better than
                                                no parents at all (except
                                                perhaps very very bad parents).
                                                To abandon culture is to abandon
                                                just one
                                                <em>one</em> upbringing, but to
                                                abandon
                                                <em>upbringing</em> itself; that
                                                is not a context in which a
                                                person can thrive.

                                                Of course, each generation
                                                should aspire to be better than
                                                their parents, and people with
                                                bad parents most of all.

                                                    <p>
                                                        I disagree that culture
                                                        and parents are
                                                        comparable in this
                                                        context. As far as
                                                        I&#8217;m aware, it is
                                                        nigh impossible for a
                                                        human to mature into
                                                        anything the slightest
                                                        bit functional in the
                                                        modern world without
                                                        parents of some kind. I
                                                        doubt the same can be
                                                        said of culture without
                                                        introducing a huge
                                                        amount of additional
                                                        subjectivity into the
                                                        evaluation of
                                                        &#8220;functional&#8221;.
                                                    </p>

                                                    <p>
                                                        Beyond that, I suspect
                                                        we may have different
                                                        notions of culture. My
                                                        working definition is
                                                        roughly the set of
                                                        social norms not
                                                        directly decided by
                                                        necessity. I dislike
                                                        unnecessary social
                                                        norms. I think they
                                                        restrict and bias
                                                        personal and social
                                                        growth, clutter and
                                                        confuse nascent minds,
                                                        discourage creativity,
                                                        and occasionally
                                                        contribute directly or
                                                        indirectly to horrible
                                                        ignorance and violence.
                                                        Not to mention make the
                                                        world a tad more boring.
                                                        For what?

                                                native Americans think it’s okay
                                                to murder members of other
                                                tribes, compared to 300 years
                                                ago?
                                            </p>

                                            <p>
                                                About the same proportion, along
                                                with a similar proportion of
                                                everyone else. The &#8220;other
                                                tribes&#8221; now tend to live
                                                further away and we now murder
                                                them in much more massive
                                                numbers. Cultural improvement at
                                                work?

                                            <p>
                                                &gt; I think, under sufficient
                                                examination and with a couple
                                                exceptions, cultural norms tend
                                                to be horrifying to a degree
                                                roughly proportional to their
                                                age.
                                            </p>

                                            <p>
                                                Horrifying to a degree roughly
                                                proportional to how different
                                                they are from your cultural
                                                norms.

                                                &gt; My working definition is
                                                roughly the set of social norms
                                                not directly decided by
                                                necessity.

                                                Of course, since what is
                                                &#8220;necessary&#8221; is at
                                                least in part culturally
                                                determined, that&#8217;s a
                                                nonsensical definition. One
                                                unambiguous necessity for human
                                                survival is for humans to be
                                                able to coexist with some
                                                modicum of harmony. Culture is
                                                how we agree to do that.

                                        In the &#8220;Ender&#8221; series from
                                        Orson Scott Card (yeah, I know, he
                                        flipped out about the gay marriage
                                        thing, so we don&#8217;t like him
                                        anymore, but&#8230;) they meet a new
                                        race of intelligent beings on a new
                                        planet.

                                        These beings are &#8220;behind&#8221;
                                        technologically, but not in terms of
                                        potential, and the humans basically pull
                                        a prime-directive to try and &#8220;keep
                                        them pure&#8221;. There was another
                                        reason to start doing this, but the real
                                        reason became the same as this
                                        discussion&#8217;s:

                                    <p>
                                        You know, because they were just so darn
                                        cute in their rustic and backward and
                                        authentic ways.

                                        Card eventually makes the point (through
                                        the characters) that if they are indeed
                                        equal, they damn-well should get to make
                                        that choice themselves. To

                                        <em>automatically</em> means that we
                                        think we are better than them, and that
                                        we are the scientist and they are the
                                        specimen.

                                                consensus COULD be reached,
                                                therefore we are morally
                                                obligated to try

                                                we are destined to go to war
                                                with them

                                        Another anecdote: Years ago, I made a
                                        website for the Rainforest Foundation.
                                        Their guiding principle was to protect
                                        the people living in the forests of the
                                        world so that those people would protect
                                        the forests themselves.
                                    </p>

                                        Nice, right. I always wondered though,
                                        what is it about these people that makes
                                        us believe that they don&#8217;t want to
                                        have clean drinking water, air
                                        conditioning, and Harvard?

                                        and well-explained. I agree with loqi:
                                        that one statement is a succinct but
                                        meaningful reply to the issue Guido
                                        raised.

                                            Corrugated metal roofs are simply
                                            superior to thatched roofs, and we
                                            can get all romantic about
                                            traditional building processes and
                                            material independence, but we do so
                                            from homes with roofs that don’t
                                            leak.

                                        This is a great example of uninformed
                                        modernist hubris. Have you ever actually
                                        lived under a thatched roof? Oddly
                                        enough, I have. For six years in a
                                        village in Lesotho (southern Africa) my
                                        family and I lived in two buildings, one
                                        with a thatched roof and one with a
                                        corrugated metal roof, and the thatched
                                        roof was far superior in pretty much
                                        every way. It never leaked once in six
                                        years, required only a single routine
                                        repair in that entire time, and provided
                                        far better insulation; it was the
                                        metal-roofed building that became
                                        uninhabitable on hot summer days. And
                                        that&#8217;s without even considering
                                        the additional cost of the corrugated
                                        metal, the problems with disposing of it
                                        after its useful lifetime, etc.

                                        The point being that if you&#8217;ve
                                        only experienced one way of life (and
                                        you&#8217;re speaking to readers who are
                                        largely likely to share your biases and
                                        lack of experience), it&#8217;s pretty
                                        easy to glibly claim its obvious
                                        superiority. But that doesn&#8217;t make
                                        it true.

                                        Much of this discussion just misses the
                                        point, in my opinion. Of course
                                        it&#8217;s patronizing to tell someone
                                        they shouldn&#8217;t want computers, or
                                        TV, or air-conditioning. Of course that
                                        should be their choice. Who&#8217;s
                                        saying they shouldn&#8217;t have that
                                        choice, except your straw man? But
                                        people should also have the choice to
                                        maintain valuable parts of their own way
                                        of life that are missing from modern
                                        homogenous Western culture, and in real
                                        history most have not (forcibly
                                        assimilated indigenous people all around
                                        the globe), and many still do not, due
                                        to powerful economic and political
                                        forces aimed at breaking down communal
                                        economies to make resources available
                                        for corporate use. Advocating against
                                        those forces is not patronizing. Glib
                                        assertions of the &#8220;obvious&#8221;
                                        superiority of modern amenities, such as
                                        this thread is full of, are patronizing.

                                        The real point is, who is setting the
                                        agenda? When I look at OLPC, I see a
                                        bunch of North Americans running the
                                        show and setting the agenda, essentially
                                        saying &#8220;THIS is what all you poor
                                        people need.&#8221; That right there is
                                        a sufficient red flag in my mind. If
                                        privileged people really want to work
                                        with marginalized people in a way that
                                        isn&#8217;t patronizing, you start by
                                        listening to what THEY say they most
                                        need, and then you place your resources
                                        and skills at the disposal of THEIR
                                        agenda. Consider this a counterproposal;
                                        it&#8217;s markedly different from the
                                        missionary approach that Guido is
                                        criticizing.

                                                I think many critiques only
                                                advocate disengagement. Or, at
                                                least, disengagement from
                                                certain aspects of modernity and
                                                technology. OLPC is trying to
                                                give a new set of people the
                                                genuine choice of &#8220;do you
                                                want a computer&#8221;. Sure,
                                                this choice is offered from an
                                                external source, but it is for
                                                me too &#8212; I&#8217;m no more
                                                capable of building a computer
                                                from raw materials than any of
                                                the people OLPC targets. This
                                                engages these people in an
                                                social, economic, and
                                                intellectual structure
                                                <em>much</em> larger than them,
                                                one that spans the world, but
                                                this is also what we North
                                                Americans have done to
                                                ourselves. Because this
                                                isn&#8217;t a &#8220;North

                                                it&#8217;s far larger than that

                                                Marginalized people are no more
                                                a monolith than privileged
                                                people are. There is no one
                                                thing that they want. And what
                                                <em>anyone</em> asks for
                                                concretely is based on the
                                                solutions they understand and
                                                are familiar with. What people
                                                ask for abstractly generally
                                                better represents their true
                                                desires. They might ask for
                                                books, but they really want
                                                education. I can&#8217;t speak
                                                to what the priorities are for
                                                various marginalized persons
                                                (though I&#8217;m sure I
                                                don&#8217;t agree with every
                                                individual, anymore than I do
                                                for every privileged

                                                what they need). Ultimately OLPC
                                                seeks to create not an answer to
                                                any need, but a tool to answer
                                                needs. They may be successful,
                                                or they might not, but I
                                                don&#8217;t think the project is
                                                structured in a way that is more
                                                enabling than directive. And of
                                                course it&#8217;s also
                                                imaginative, which is to say:
                                                neither we nor they know what it
                                                will achieve. Also: there is no
                                                one thing that everyone will ask
                                                for, but there are tools that
                                                anyone can potentially benefit
                                                from. OLPC is working at a
                                                certain scale and generality
                                                that must assert a benefit
                                                rather than asking individually.

                                                often blind to other tiers.

                                                        I&#8217;ll also add:
                                                        people can contribute
                                                        according to their
                                                        ability and skills. If
                                                        someone comes to me
                                                        asking about software, I
                                                        can help. If they ask
                                                        for eyeglasses, I
                                                        can&#8217;t help.
                                                        There&#8217;s this idea
                                                        that somehow
                                                        there&#8217;s this free
                                                        energy out there that
                                                        can be directed to
                                                        anything, and by
                                                        directing it to OLPC
                                                        that it detracts from
                                                        the most ideal activity
                                                        each person can think
                                                        of. That&#8217;s not how
                                                        it works. When people
                                                        say &#8220;OLPC
                                                        isn&#8217;t the right
                                                        thing&#8221; they are
                                                        basically saying
                                                        &#8220;all the people
                                                        working on OLPC should
                                                        stop and not do anything
                                                        for these people&#8221;
                                                        because frankly I
                                                        haven&#8217;t heard much

                                                        thread has anything to

                                                        Thanks Ian for the
                                                        thoughtful reply.
                                                    </p>

                                                    <p>
                                                        &gt; I think many
                                                        critiques only advocate
                                                        disengagement.
                                                    </p>

                                                    <p>
                                                        As far as I can see,
                                                        this is only true if one
                                                        postulates a single
                                                        binary choice:
                                                        &#8220;engagement&#8221;
                                                        vs
                                                        &#8220;disengagement&#8221;,
                                                        rather than an array of
                                                        possible modes of
                                                        engagement, and then
                                                        presumes that any critic
                                                        of a particular mode of
                                                        engagement must
                                                        therefore be advocating
                                                        disengagement if they
                                                        don&#8217;t explicitly
                                                        lay out an alternative.
                                                        I haven&#8217;t seen

                                                        will strive to develop

                                                        My initial criticism of
                                                        OLPC was overblown. I
                                                        really don&#8217;t know
                                                        that much about OLPC.
                                                        Specifically, I would
                                                        want to know much more
                                                        about <em>how</em> OLPC
                                                        engages in specific
                                                        countries and locations,
                                                        and I&#8217;m sure that
                                                        varies. All I can really
                                                        say is that the language
                                                        on the OLPC website is
                                                        too missionary, and the
                                                        model too
                                                        one-size-fits-all, for
                                                        me to have interest in

                                                        project. I certainly
                                                        wouldn&#8217;t be

                                                        Western culture has a
                                                        tendency to believe that

                                                        one valid set of values
                                                        to apply to it;
                                                        coincidentally, those
                                                        happen to be

                                                        and <em>our</em> values.
                                                        We are very quick to
                                                        presume, even when

                                                        thus far, and discard
                                                        the notion (again,

                                                        worldview is essentially
                                                        driving the project?

                                            <p>
                                                Well most laptops are sold to
                                                governments. If the governments
                                                want them then that IS their
                                                choice. You may argue that
                                                governments do not know whats
                                                best for their people. If this
                                                is your argument then giving
                                                government tools to help
                                                learning seems a good bet. It is
                                                much better then giving them
                                                money (or arms).
                                            </p>

                                            <p>
                                                In giving aid, giving the people
                                                what they ask for is always the
                                                best. However, practically this
                                                is impossible. If the
                                                infrastructure in those
                                                countries was good enough to
                                                communicate a consensus of their
                                                own wishes then I doubt the
                                                countries (or regions) would be
                                                on the radar to receive them.
                                                There is nothing wrong with
                                                making and developing an offer
                                                of some new form of aid, based
                                                on your own best judgment. It is
                                                better then sitting by and not
                                                doing anything, and waiting for
                                                a mythical time when a solution
                                                arises. No proposal will fit all
                                                peoples needs, sometimes a
                                                proposal will be destructive.
                                                However in the case of a laptop
                                                I very much doubt it will be
                                                destructive (I cant see why it
                                                would be?). It may be that there
                                                will be no take up, which is
                                                fine, but at least they tried.
                                                The world in this regard is
                                                deeply lacking innovation. The
                                                other main solution is helping
                                                people to set up their own
                                                businesses (normally in western
                                                model) but doing that is more
                                                dangerous.

                                                I don&#8217;t think OLPC
                                                proclaims to know what people
                                                actually want, but it is another
                                                option, and options are good. I
                                                am sure some (maybe not all)
                                                teachers in these places, if
                                                asked if they could have
                                                wikipedia, would opt to have it.

                                                If one thinks idea of a laptop
                                                and the internet are bad. Then
                                                they should stop using them
                                                themselves. The only way you can
                                                truly teach is by exemplifying
                                                your ideas with your own action.
                                                What you do and are as an
                                                individual, you should be proud
                                                of showing to EVERY other person
                                                on the planet.

                                                    <p>Hi David,</p>

                                                    <p>
                                                        In large part, I agree
                                                        with you. As I said
                                                        above, that paragraph on
                                                        OLPC was hastily worded
                                                        and overblown. What I
                                                        can really say is that I
                                                        am more interested in
                                                        engaging with
                                                        development or activism
                                                        efforts that are
                                                        initiated and driven by
                                                        marginalized people
                                                        themselves (and make no
                                                        mistake, such efforts
                                                        exist all around the
                                                        globe, they just have a
                                                        much harder time getting
                                                        attention than something
                                                        like OLPC). I am wary of
                                                        a project like OLPC when
                                                        I see so many
                                                        American/British names
                                                        on the lists even of
                                                        local OLPC coordinators
                                                        in various parts of the
                                                        globe.

                                                        Aboriginal leader Lilla
                                                        Watson: &#8220;If you
                                                        have come to help us,
                                                        you are wasting your
                                                        time. But, if you have
                                                        come because your
                                                        liberation is bound up
                                                        with our liberation, let
                                                        us work together.&#8221;

                                        Carl Meyer: &#8220;But people should
                                        also have the choice to maintain
                                        valuable parts of their own way of life
                                        that are missing from modern homogenous
                                        Western culture, and in real history
                                        most have not (forcibly assimilated
                                        indigenous people all around the globe),
                                        and many still do not, due to powerful
                                        economic and political forces aimed at
                                        breaking down communal economies to make
                                        resources available for corporate use.
                                        Advocating against those forces is not
                                        patronizing. Glib assertions of the
                                        “obvious” superiority of modern
                                        amenities, such as this thread is full
                                        of, are patronizing.&#8221;

                                        On this I completely agree with you,
                                        except to nitpick that &#8220;Western
                                        culture&#8221; is actually anything but
                                        homogeneous, unless you restrict your
                                        definition to the portions of it given
                                        coverage by Hollywood and CNN. But I
                                        fail to see the connect between the
                                        above and your complaints against OLPC:

                                        saying “THIS is what all you poor people
                                        need.” That right there is a sufficient
                                        red flag in my mind.&#8221;

                                        OLPC originated from
                                        &#8220;constructionist learning&#8221;
                                        theory. It&#8217;s an educational
                                        project, so a more accurate placement of
                                        words into their collective mouths might
                                        be &#8220;THIS is what all you children
                                        need.&#8221; Or maybe, &#8220;THIS is a
                                        faithful implementation of our
                                        findings.&#8221;

                                        Yes, they&#8217;re a bunch of North
                                        Americans&#8230; because North Americans
                                        are doing advanced research into
                                        theories of learning. If their research
                                        leads them to the conclusion that
                                        something like OLPC can be hugely
                                        beneficial to children in developing
                                        (and developed!) nations, should they
                                        just sit on it and pretend they
                                        don&#8217;t know? Should they, before
                                        providing a remarkable opportunity to
                                        millions of children, backtrack all the
                                        way to &#8220;generic charity&#8221;,
                                        spend all the time and money needed to
                                        figure out what&#8217;s &#8220;purely
                                        best&#8221; for each and every culture

                                            A common myth states that the term
                                            &#8220;missionary position&#8221;
                                            arose in response to Christian
                                            missionaries, who taught that the
                                            position was the only proper way to
                                            engage in sexual intercourse. This
                                            explanation probably originated from
                                            Alfred Kinsey&#8217;s Sexual
                                            Behavior in the Human Male through a

                                        But the (wildly uncompetitive) US sugar
                                        growers captured the regulators in DC,
                                        and imposed tariffs, quotas, and price
                                        floors to protect their business from
                                        Caribbean competition. Once cane sugar
                                        was made about twice as expensive as it
                                        otherwise would be, substitutes arose:
                                        beet sugar and high-fructose corn syrup.

                                        Another good example is hydrogenated
                                        fats, which tend to contain lots of
                                        trans fats: the companies that produce
                                        them leaned on the Federal government in
                                        the fifties and sixties to push them as
                                        a replacement for unhealthy saturated
                                        (cis) fats, while simultaneously
                                        convincing the government not to
                                        actually test the health effects of
                                        trans fats. Decades later, it turns out
                                        that, oops, trans fats are much worse
                                        for you than even saturated fats.

                                        I know this is tangential to your main

                                    <p>You focus a very interesting point.</p>

                                    <p>
                                        Recently I tried to understand (by
                                        joining forums and talking to
                                        nationalists) why is so many people
                                        paranoid with the Nation and &#8220;Our
                                        culture&#8221; concepts, whatever those
                                        mean. I was talking about the pros/cons
                                        of nations, what does it really mean
                                        with the communications and transports
                                        keeping us tied anywhere in the world,
                                        to be Danish or American or Portuguese.
                                        The same way we don&#8217;t want to be
                                        judged by our fathers crimes, our
                                        culture should just be what we make of
                                        it and not &#8220;tagged&#8221;. In a
                                        question, What is so wrong with the
                                        &#8220;Citizen of the World&#8221;
                                        thing? I got a lot of
                                        &#8220;noise&#8221;, flaming and some
                                        few interesting points on the problems
                                        of the Globalization. Culture
                                        &#8220;destruction&#8221;, the way you
                                        talk about it, was one of them.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        My conclusion is that there is no such
                                        thing as &#8220;our culture&#8221;
                                        independent from the time. Our cultures
                                        evolve, receives and shares influence
                                        with other cultures and tends to mix
                                        what people find good in one another. In
                                        the past, that process was slow. Today,
                                        with comms and transps. its fast.
                                        That&#8217;s why it doesn&#8217;t make
                                        sense to compare one century of history
                                        1000 years ago side by side with present
                                        century.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        Letting this process go in the wild is a
                                        good idea? probably not, but can we
                                        fully control it? Definitely not, there
                                        will be wars, we are very likely to die
                                        soon in a WW3,&#8230; so why do
                                        something about it if we know that it
                                        will bring problems? Because,
                                        that&#8217;s our nature. In the past we
                                        wrote it for the first time. Now with
                                        some knowledge we can predict but still
                                        we can&#8217;t fully control it.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        Pretending that we can&#8217;t ear
                                        someone shouting into our ears will
                                        never make us ignore it and we will
                                        always be influenced by each other.
                                        It&#8217;s not an artificial concept
                                        like &#8220;country border&#8221; that
                                        can stop that, just delay it as
                                        much&#8230; History doesn&#8217;t repeat
                                        itself&#8230; It makes us think yes but
                                        every time we see something we think we
                                        have seen in the past there is always
                                        something a little different. For the
                                        good and for the bad, that&#8217;s
                                        called Evolution.

                                    <p>
                                        &#8220;There’s no piece of culture that
                                        I would want to deny from anyone.&#8221;
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        I love that. All culture belongs to all
                                        people.
                                    </p>

                                        I agree that assimilation is inevitable.
                                        Homogenization, even, to a certain
                                        extent. Even movements to preserve
                                        cultural artifacts end up turning them
                                        into fetish versions, not the
                                        &#8220;real thing.&#8221; But that has
                                        to be okay, cause it&#8217;s not like we
                                        can stop it.

                                        What I&#8217;m saying is that it&#8217;s
                                        a necessary fact of the way systems
                                        scale that details and nuance get lost.
                                        It&#8217;s abstraction.

                                    <p>Yeah, it&#8217;s a pity cultures die:</p>

                                    <p>
                                        I remember talking with Miguel de La
                                        Cuadra and other explorers about things
                                        like that. You know there were people
                                        that killed each other in Africa, and
                                        that was ok, because it was your enemy.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        It was ok to fuck with whatever woman
                                        you wanted when you went back from
                                        hunting(you could fuck 16,17 years old
                                        girls before they marry and got
                                        &#8220;women&#8221;, if you fuck a not
                                        yours &#8220;women&#8221; you got killed
                                        or pay) Now the christian culture tells
                                        us that killing is bad, fucking is bad,
                                        and now they don&#8217;t kill. If you
                                        ask the elders(one on them had killed 45
                                        men) those were the days.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        Those days you could eat your enemies
                                        without other people telling you thats
                                        bad.Those days when shaman voice was
                                        heard, and feared, and not like today
                                        that he is only a tourist attraction.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        In a lot places in Africa and America
                                        people were afraid(really really afraid)
                                        of devils, Voodoo an do, someone could
                                        kill you if for example urinated on a
                                        sacred tree or excavate a hole on sacred
                                        terrain without noticing(I know an
                                        european engineer that disappeared after
                                        doing that).
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        In America there was a time you could
                                        take your enemies-prisoners heart out of
                                        their chest in live. It must be an
                                        interesting spectacle. You could rape
                                        your enemies wifes(and men, it was high
                                        status to rape men, low to be raped) as
                                        well once you slaved them.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        That someone decides that for example
                                        removing your clitoris or the tip of the
                                        pennis(there are cultures that remove
                                        the sensible tip, not just the foreskin)
                                        is stupid and cultural imperialism.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        We should preserve cultures, we should
                                        not tell anybody that options exist. We
                                        are richer when people ignore those
                                        options and not change.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        A pity the world is unifying. We should
                                        make walls and forbid communication
                                        between them.
                                    </p>
