                                    The basic idea is simple: we should have
                                    fonts at the &quot;default&quot; size, about
                                    16px, no smaller. This is about the size of
                                    text in print, read at a reasonable distance
                                    (typically closer up than a screen):
                                </p>

                                    <img

                                    Also it calls out low-contrast color
                                    schemes, which I think are mostly passe, and
                                    I will not insult you, my reader, by
                                    suggesting you don&#8217;t entirely agree.
                                    Because if you <em>don&#8217;t</em> agree,
                                    well, I&#8217;m afraid I&#8217;d have to use
                                    some strong words.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    I think small fonts, low contrast, huge
                                    amounts of whitespace, are a side effect of
                                    the audience designers create for.

                                    This makes me think of

                                    This is a form of architecture popular for
                                    skyscapers and other dramatic structures,
                                    with their soaring heights and other such
                                    dramatic adjectives. These are buildings
                                    designed for someone looking at the building
                                    from five hundred feet away. They are not
                                    designed for occupants. But that&#8217;s
                                    okay, because the design isn&#8217;t sold to
                                    occupants, it is sold to people who look at
                                    the sketches and want to feel very dramatic.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Similarly, I think the design pattern of
                                    small fonts is something meant to appeal to
                                    shallow observation. By deemphasizing the
                                    text itself, the design is accentuated.
                                    Low-contrast text is even more obviously the
                                    domination of design over content. And it
                                    may very well look more professional and
                                    visually pleasing. But web design
                                    isn&#8217;t for making sites visually
                                    pleasing, it is for making the experience of
                                    the content more pleasing. Sites exist for
                                    their content, not their design.

                                    In 100e2r he also says
                                    <em>let your text breathe</em>. You need
                                    whitespace. If you
                                    <a
                                        class="reference external"
                                        href="index.html"
                                        >view my site directly</a
                                    >, you&#8217;ll notice I don&#8217;t have
                                    big white margins around my text. When you
                                    come to my site, it&#8217;s to see my words,
                                    and that&#8217;s what I&#8217;m going to
                                    give you! When I want to let my text
                                    <em>breathe</em> with lots of
                                    <em>whitespace</em> this is what I do:
                                </p>
                                <div align="center" class="align-center">

                                    Is a huge block of text hard to read? It is.
                                    And yeah, I&#8217;ve written articles like
                                    that. But the solution?
                                </p>
                                <div style="text-align: center">

                                    Similarly, it&#8217;s hard to read text if
                                    you don&#8217;t use paragraphs, but the
                                    solution isn&#8217;t to increase your line
                                    height until every line is like a paragraph
                                    of its own.
                                </p>

                                    The solution to the drudgery of large
                                    swathes of text is:
                                </p>
                                <ol class="arabic simple">
                                    <li>Make your blocks of text smaller.</li>
                                    <li>
                                        Use something other than paragraphs of
                                        text.
                                    </li>
                                </ol>

                                    Throw in a list. Do some indentation. Toss
                                    in even a stupid picture. Personally I try
                                    to throw in code examples, because
                                    that&#8217;s how we roll on this blog.
                                </p>

                                    That&#8217;s good writing, that&#8217;s
                                    content that is easy to read. It&#8217;s not
                                    easy to write, and I&#8217;m sure I miss the
                                    mark more often than not. But you
                                    can&#8217;t design your way to good content.
                                    If you want to write like this, if you want
                                    to let the flow of your text reflect the
                                    flow of your ideas, you need
                                    <strong>room</strong>. Huge margins
                                    don&#8217;t give you room. They are a crutch
                                    for poor writing, and not even a good
                                    crutch.

                                <p>
                                    So in conclusion: modern design be damned!

                                    <p>Ian &#8212; right on.</p>

                                    <p>
                                        This reminded me of something I found
                                        when I was first working with HTML as a
                                        college freshman:
                                        <a
                                            href="http://www.poynton.com/notes/rants/Netscape&#95;rant.html"
                                            rel="nofollow"
                                            >http://www.poynton.com/notes/rants/Netscape_rant.html</a
                                        >
                                        &#8212; it&#8217;s old and it took me a
                                        while to find it again but I really
                                        liked a lot of the basic ideas for
                                        usability that are contained in it and
                                        even now, looking back, some of the
                                        basic tenets still hold true. At one
                                        point, some people had this idea of the
                                        web as being populated with documents
                                        whose display you and your browser had
                                        quite a bit of control over:
                                        <em
                                            >&#8220;I do not assume that I know
                                            what text size is best for your
                                            display and for your vision;
                                            instead, I assume that you know how
                                            to set your browser for your own
                                            choice.&#8221;</em
                                        >
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        Indeed &#8212; I could see the idea of
                                        16 pt. font being acceptable if one must
                                        pick a default, but designs
                                        shouldn&#8217;t break when
                                        <em>I</em> make the text smaller because
                                        <em>I</em> want to see more in a given
                                        area and can tolerate a smaller
                                        font&#8230; indeed, if you&#8217;ve done
                                        something that breaks when I change the
                                        font size, it seems to me you&#8217;re
                                        thinking of web design too much like
                                        print design where the borders are fixed
                                        and the media is always the same size
                                        &#8212; the size you, the designer
                                        decide on at the outset
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        Clearly this fails &#8212; sometimes
                                        I&#8217;m on my 13 in. laptop. Others
                                        I&#8217;m at my desk, staring at a
                                        bigger, wider screen that I sit further
                                        away from. I assure you, pages look very
                                        different on both of those
                                        displays&#8230; but they should both be
                                        able to look good and be usable&#8230;
                                        without making me do too much work each
                                        time I want to use them to their
                                        fullest.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        It really doesn&#8217;t seem like
                                        it&#8217;s that hard of a concept and I
                                        don&#8217;t mean to sound like I&#8217;m
                                        saying anything novel &#8212; all
                                        I&#8217;m saying is that it seems
                                        amazing to me that it&#8217;s so often
                                        missed.

                                        All good points and well put. However,
                                        large font and contrast are not the only
                                        things that help readability. The amount
                                        of words on a line plays a big part to.
                                        It is said that there should be about
                                        10-12 words in a line.

                                        Actually you should not rely on pixels
                                        units if you want to define a fixed size
                                        for the reader. Point (pt) is used for
                                        typography, and css allows to use
                                        points. Pixel dimensions vary with
                                        resolution, point units can be converted
                                        to centimeters. Nowadays most screen
                                        display around 100dpi, 10 years ago it
                                        was near 75dpi; my laptop has a
                                        15&#8243;4 screen @1680&#215;1050:
                                        that&#8217;s 128dpi. Thus, 16px are
                                        smaller on my screen than many others,
                                        whereas 12pt (should) result in the
                                        exact same size.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        Usually web design involves to play with
                                        images, so we end up sizing the text
                                        with the same units: pixels. But for
                                        pure text, &#8220;pt&#8221; is more
                                        reliable (as well as &#8220;em&#8221;
                                        for controlling width relative to text).

                                        Left and right margins are still nice. I
                                        think it&#8217;s also easier to read
                                        text in somewhat narrow columns, like
                                        what Kamil said. In that case, the max
                                        width of the paragraphs (or content
                                        container) should be specified. Margins
                                        may appear for people with very large
                                        screens. People typically have very
                                        large screens so that they can view
                                        windows side by side, not so that they
                                        can read wide-columned text (-:

                                        otherwise, great post. small fonts and
                                        poor contrast <em>are</em> terribly
                                        inconvenient. in firefox when i make
                                        text larger it often increases paragraph
                                        width so that i have to scroll. not
                                        quite the right solution&#8230;

                                        The point of margin whitespace is so
                                        that the text isn&#8217;t all crowded
                                        together and so the columns don&#8217;t
                                        get too wide. I&#8217;m keeping my
                                        browser at the size it needs to be for
                                        viewing most pages, some of which are
                                        very wide. When a page doesn&#8217;t
                                        need to be wide and has text across the
                                        whole screen it becomes harder to read
                                        because I have to track my eyes all the
                                        way back across (and hopefully not lose
                                        my line).

                                        You could argue that I can just resize
                                        my browser just like I can resize my
                                        fonts, but I can&#8217;t have the
                                        browser be different sizes for different
                                        tabs.

                                        choice can (size being slightly less
                                        relevant) can immediately relax the eyes
                                        &#8211; I was just comparing your site

                                    <p>Awesome, I agree completely.</p>

                                    <p>
                                        I also hate attempts at space-design
                                        that result in pages that have to be
                                        viewed in a wide window, else you lose
                                        the right column of stuff. Even if
                                        someone has a big screen, do you really
                                        expect them to have the browser window
                                        open to full-screen? Sadly, most people
                                        probably do, but I&#8217;m not sure
                                        whether this is from ignorance/defaults
                                        or because they&#8217;ve been pushed
                                        into it by wide designs.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        I wonder whether the growth in
                                        mobile-reading will change things?

                                    <p>
                                        But that&#8217;s the thing&#8230; a web
                                        page/site should, IMHO, use all the
                                        space it is given. If I want to make it
                                        3360px wide (and have the screen space
                                        to do so) I should be able to do it and
                                        the design should respect my sizing and
                                        use it reasonably well.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        I&#8217;ll grant some notion of minimum
                                        spacing &#8212; I don&#8217;t expect an
                                        average page to look good in a 100px
                                        wide window, for example &#8212; but
                                        800px is clearly too big, so it can go
                                        too far&#8230;but to limit the maximum
                                        width seems to be enforcing old-media
                                        ideas on what should be seen as a
                                        fundamentally new medium with many new
                                        rules. Sure text gets hard to read (for
                                        many people) when the rows become really
                                        wide &#8212; but it&#8217;s less of an
                                        issue for some and there are even
                                        legitimate uses for it from time to time
                                        and there&#8217;s no reason other than
                                        style-nannyism to enforce maximum
                                        widths.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        Moreover, maximum widths are constraints
                                        of hard-copy pages, much more so than
                                        they are of web browsers because a
                                        browser will have different window sizes
                                        and the max size is effectively huge but
                                        may be tiny, all for the same document
                                        (seen on different screens). Compare
                                        that to a print-page being laid out for
                                        a magazine &#8212; it is designed for
                                        one size and that page will
                                        <em>always</em> be that size, regardless
                                        of who&#8217;s reading it or where
                                        they&#8217;re reading it, once
                                        it&#8217;s in it&#8217;s published form.

                                    <p>
                                        Yes, my idea breaks with a lot of
                                        what&#8217;s standard practice for many
                                        web designers, but that&#8217;s just the
                                        point &#8212; they&#8217;re doing it
                                        wrong and depriving us all of one of the
                                        things that makes the web so cool
                                        &#8212; it&#8217;s supposed to be
                                        flexible and browser/screen/environment
                                        agnostic. And for a good reason &#8212;
                                        there are many different screens out
                                        there!

                                        Which seems better &#8212; A) designs
                                        that accept/use only one window width
                                        (below which they force horizontal
                                        scrolling) and above which they pad with
                                        ever-increasing white space, ensuring
                                        some amount of vertical scrolling
                                        because content can&#8217;t use the
                                        available width. or
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        B) Designs that use as much of the width
                                        they&#8217;re given so that the user can
                                        decide how they want to use their screen
                                        real estate?
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        From a user&#8217;s perspective, I like
                                        the latter.

                                                it&#8217;s the open source
                                                mantra: give the user control.

                                                the problem of how wide to users
                                                want to read should not be
                                                answered by the
                                                server&#8211;should every server
                                                know that about every
                                                user?&#8211;but by the client.
                                                it should be a browser
                                                preference.

                                                the only problem with user
                                                ownership is user
                                                responsibility. i love using
                                                emacs (total customization of
                                                keys and macros), but i have
                                                gotten used to my webpages
                                                looking &#8220;right&#8221; with
                                                minimal effort on my part. also,
                                                sometimes the server knows more
                                                about how its website should
                                                look than the user, especially
                                                when it&#8217;s more than a blog
                                                and has specific kind of data.

                                        Arguably my blog is too wide, though it
                                        depends some on the window and browser.
                                        I&#8217;m not certain this is the right
                                        layout. But it doesn&#8217;t just depend
                                        on the browser, it also depends on the
                                        post. There is no inappropriately wide
                                        space to present code, for instance. Or
                                        if you have a many-level list, greater
                                        width is almost certainly better. Or
                                        tables.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        An ideal situation is one where the
                                        author could make choices about the
                                        layout based on the content (typically
                                        per-page). This is how print layout
                                        works, after all. They might get 10-12
                                        words per line, but there&#8217;s also a
                                        lot of work put forth to make sure that
                                        isn&#8217;t 2-3 words on some lines,
                                        with hyphenation, image size, margins,
                                        and a variety of tweaks that can make
                                        the layout work better. Computer print
                                        is seldom handled like this, and
                                        there&#8217;s a limit to how much work
                                        you can put forth at all due to the
                                        reading environment that you can&#8217;t
                                        control (though I&#8217;m sure every
                                        developer and designer has encountered
                                        pressure to use images or PDF to achieve
                                        print-like consistency).
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        The appropriate compromises for
                                        computers aren&#8217;t the same as
                                        print, IMHO. Maybe 10-12 words per line
                                        is best, but it might be better to
                                        increase that amount to avoid some
                                        common situations where layout falls
                                        apart. There is some very unreadable
                                        content out there, made so because
                                        it&#8217;s been squeezed into
                                        whitespace-loving templates.
                                    </p>

                                        Maybe the <em>best</em> solution would
                                        be content authoring tools with
                                        conventions for breaking out of
                                        constraints. E.g., the ability to put
                                        <code>&lt;div class="wide"&gt;</code>
                                        around any content. I&#8217;m sure
                                        there&#8217;s applications that allow
                                        this explicitly, but they are few and
                                        far between.

                                        I’ve been told my site is visually
                                        striking, and yet I spent almost the
                                        entirety of my design efforts in
                                        obsessing over how to make it more
                                        readable and less cluttered. You can
                                        have both. You just have to care about
                                        both.

                                        Frankly I found this rant one-sided and
                                        somewhat ignorant. (And the comments are
                                        even more depressing.) Design is not
                                        making things pretty. Design is not
                                        lipstick. Design is making things work
                                        well.

                                        The solution to sites designed with too
                                        much focus on visuals is not to renounce
                                        design altogether and party like it’s
                                        1996.

                                        a web page/site should, IMHO, use all
                                        the space it is given
                                    </blockquote>

                                    <p>
                                        If every page had its own window that
                                        might be a fine argument, but tabbed
                                        browsing defeats this point. I am not
                                        going to resize my browser every time I
                                        switch a tab and not every page presents
                                        the same amount of different types of
                                        content at once (one, two, three
                                        columns, with different amounts of
                                        content, etc.). So I am going to
                                        routinely give pages more space than I
                                        would consider the ideal.

                                        And if you wanted to make your argument
                                        honestly, you would have to argue that
                                        each site should also give every reader
                                        a way to adjust line-heigh to their
                                        preferences.

                                        Sorry, but heaps of research on the
                                        readability of text makes a solid
                                        argument in favour of certain things
                                        that you can’t hand-wave away with a
                                        “old-media ideas in a fundamentally new
                                        medium” platitude unless you also supply
                                        new eyes and brains to go with the new
                                        medium.

                                        I could not agree more. I am constantly
                                        adjusting the font size to something I
                                        can read. Of course I have the problem
                                        of aging eyes which does not help.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        My other pet peeve &#8212; whitish or
                                        light grey text on a dark background. I
                                        launch a personal crusade on the issue
                                        every time I see a web design of that
                                        nature. I know it is all the Matrix
                                        vogue to have such designs, sigh. The
                                        Wachowski brothers should be marched to
                                        Troy, Ohio, tied to a Linotype machine
                                        and shot.

                                            <p>
                                                &gt; My other pet peeve —
                                                whitish or light grey text on a
                                                dark background. I launch a
                                                personal crusade on the issue
                                                every time I see a web design of
                                                that nature. I know it is all
                                                the Matrix vogue to have such
                                                designs, sigh. The Wachowski
                                                brothers should be marched to
                                                Troy, Ohio, tied to a Linotype
                                                machine and shot.
                                            </p>

                                            <p>
                                                Personally, I find light on dark
                                                to be much more readable than
                                                dark on light. My bias perhaps
                                                comes from two sources: my
                                                experience dealing with
                                                projectors, and my tendency to
                                                surf late at night.
                                            </p>

                                            <p>
                                                On projected media, light colors
                                                tend to bleed into darker areas,
                                                so the dark text gets swallowed
                                                by the light background
                                                surrounding it. I especially
                                                noticed this on my high
                                                school&#8217;s large LCD (which,
                                                granted, is not run by a
                                                projector) screen, which
                                                displays announcements and such
                                                before school. People generally
                                                had difficulty reading the
                                                blue-on-yellow pages, but
                                                yellow-on-blue was always fine.

                                            <p>
                                                The other is a bit more
                                                subjective to lifestyle choices
                                                &#8211; when I&#8217;ve been
                                                using my computer in a darkish
                                                room, with dark-schemed
                                                terminal, editor, and everything
                                                else, a sudden switch over to a
                                                white-backgrounded website does
                                                terrible things to my pupils.
                                                Keeping everything light, to
                                                avoid that, causes undue stress
                                                on my eyes, and I get headaches
                                                and have a hard time keeping
                                                focus.

                                        Amusingly, white space in print is not a
                                        modern design feature. It&#8217;s the
                                        result of centuries of typesetting
                                        history. Wide text and especially the
                                        concept of a fluid layout are fairly
                                        modern and are rather specific to
                                        digital media.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        White space can be (and often is)
                                        abused, but it isn&#8217;t inherently
                                        evil. People just need to learn how to
                                        use it properly. Unfortunately, the web
                                        is not currently capable of an ideal
                                        solution, so we&#8217;ve mostly
                                        degenerated to arguing about fixed,
                                        fluid, and elastic layouts.

                                        The images displayed in this blog are
                                        thought provoking and mesmerizing.Your
                                        observations regarding fonts, color
                                        contrasts, and white spaces is quiet
                                        interesting especially from the
                                        standpoint of a web master. I agree with
                                        you completely because that content of
                                        the web site is more important than the
                                        visual aspect. To make your content
                                        readable it is always a good idea to use
                                        bullets and numbering and create
                                        appropriate spaces (or whitespaces)
                                        between paragraphs. I think the aim is
                                        to make your content flow easily as
                                        opposed to too much overcrowding of
                                        words. Nevertless, your suggestions are
                                        welcome and make sense.

                                    <p>
                                        Ian, first i like to thank you for this
                                        useful post. You have mentioned few
                                        important areas of web design. I think a
                                        web site is not only for eye comfort and
                                        viewing pleasure, but also for visitors
                                        useful needs. The goal of a website
                                        designers must concentrate on how long
                                        the visitor stays at the website. So a
                                        good design, font size, color, contrast
                                        plays a vital role in designing because
                                        visitor may involved with the design as
                                        well as content. But this factors must
                                        not play as important role that visitor
                                        might be out of track and instead of
                                        looking at the content he might be busy
                                        with its design.
                                    </p>

                                        Great post, Ian. Keeping fonts regular
                                        size and maximum contrast makes your
                                        content accessible to a significant
                                        percentage of people who have mild
                                        visual impairment. Great work, thanks!
