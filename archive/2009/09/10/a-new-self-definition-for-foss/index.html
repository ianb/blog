                                    I&#8217;ve been programming Python web
                                    software for quite a while now. I considered
                                    coming here and talked about WSGI,
                                    standards, cross-framework integration,
                                    etc., but I decided I wanted to come up here
                                    and talk to you as compatriots, as fellow
                                    open source programmers.

                                    Over the past year or so I have been
                                    thinking a lot about politics. Not electoral
                                    politics per se, or the geopolitical
                                    situation, but the question of the meaning
                                    of what we are doing. Maybe it is some sort
                                    of programmer midlife crisis: why am I doing
                                    what I&#8217;m doing, and why does it
                                    matter? And also I have been thinking a lot
                                    about open source &#8212; what this thing
                                    that we&#8217;re doing means in the larger
                                    context. Are we just engineers? Is there
                                    some sort of movement? If so, what is that
                                    movement? Especially as open source has
                                    become more popular, the sense of a movement
                                    seems to dwindle. It felt like a movement 10
                                    years ago, but not as much today. Why should
                                    this happen? Why now, in the midst of
                                    success does open source seem less
                                    politically relevant than it did 10 years
                                    ago?
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    I&#8217;m also speaking somewhat to Django
                                    specifically, as I think it is one of the
                                    communities with a bit more resistance to
                                    the idea of the politics of code. The Django
                                    philosophy is more: the value of this code
                                    is the value of what you do with it.
                                    I&#8217;m not here to criticize this
                                    perspective, but to think about how we can
                                    find meaning without relying on the
                                    traditional free software ideas. To see if
                                    there&#8217;s something here that
                                    isn&#8217;t described yet.
                                </p>

                                    I&#8217;d like to start with a quick history
                                    of free and open source software. My own
                                    start was in highschool where I was taking a
                                    class in which we all used Emacs. This was
                                    my first introduction to any real sort of
                                    programming environment, to Unix, to a text
                                    editor that was anything to talk about. At
                                    the time Emacs would say at startup &quot;to
                                    learn more about the GNU project hit
                                    Control-H Control-P&quot; &#8212; because of
                                    course you need a keyboard shortcut to get
                                    to a philosophy statement about an editor.
                                    So one day I hit Control-H Control-P. I was
                                    expecting to see some sort of About Message,
                                    or if you remember the software of the times
                                    maybe something about Shareware, or even
                                    &quot;if you really like this software,
                                    consider giving to the Red Cross.&quot; But
                                    instead I came upon the GNU Manifesto.

                                        Let me quote the section &quot;Why I

                                            &quot;I consider that the golden
                                            rule requires that if I like a
                                            program I must share it with other
                                            people who like it. Software sellers
                                            want to divide the users and conquer
                                            them, making each user agree not to
                                            share with others. I refuse to break
                                            solidarity with other users in this
                                            way. [it continues...]

                                            computers without dishonor, I have
                                            decided to put together a sufficient
                                            body of free software so that I will
                                            be able to get along without any
                                            software that is not free.&quot;

                                            &quot;The fundamental act of
                                            friendship among programmers is the
                                            sharing of programs; marketing
                                            arrangements now typically used
                                            essentially forbid programmers to
                                            treat others as friends. The
                                            purchaser of software must choose
                                            between friendship and obeying the
                                            law. Naturally, many decide that
                                            friendship is more important. But
                                            those who believe in law often do
                                            not feel at ease with either choice.
                                            They become cynical and think that
                                            programming is just a way of making
                                            money.&quot;

                                        immediate head-over-heels in love with
                                        this concept. As a teenager, thinking

                                        world, having a statement that was so
                                        intellectually aggressive was exciting.
                                        It didn&#8217;t ask: &quot;how wrong is
                                        piracy really&quot;, or &quot;why are
                                        our kids doing this&quot;, but it asked
                                        &quot;is piracy a moral imperative&quot;
                                        &#8212; that&#8217;s the kind of

                                        actions or their long-term effects.
                                        Instead it asked: what must we do, not
                                        as a society, not in service of some
                                        end, but what are we called upon to do

                                        <em>right now</em>, in service of the
                                        people we call friends. It didn&#8217;t
                                        allude to any sociological explanation,
                                        natural selection, economics; there is

                                    <p>
                                        When I first encountered free software,
                                        I suppose about 15 years ago, this was
                                        during one of the more difficult periods
                                        of its evolution. It was past the
                                        initial excitement, the initial optimism
                                        that the project would take only a
                                        couple years to reach parity with
                                        closed-source Unix, it was before it was
                                        clear how the project would move
                                        forward. Linux was young and seemed to
                                        be largely off the radar of Richard
                                        Stallman and other GNU advocates, and
                                        they were struggling to fill in final
                                        key pieces, things like a kernel,
                                        widgets, and they hadn&#8217;t even
                                        thought about entirely new things like
                                        browsers.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        The message that came through from that
                                        period is not the message I wish came
                                        through. The message I wish came through
                                        was that message from the GNU Manifesto,
                                        that spirit of a new sense of duty and
                                        ability. When people talk about Richard
                                        Stallman and the Free Software
                                        Foundation and the GNU Project,
                                        they&#8217;ll often point to the GNU
                                        General Public License as the most
                                        important contribution &#8212; the GPL.
                                        I&#8217;m sure you all know something
                                        about it. Of course the core concept
                                        there is the idea of copyleft. Not only
                                        will the software be open, but
                                        it&#8217;s takes the implied perspective
                                        that the principles of freedom are
                                        rights &#8212; that unfortunately the
                                        world is not wise enough to see that
                                        use, distribution, and modification are
                                        rights; but the GPL still asserts that
                                        these <em>are</em> your rights. When you
                                        become one of us, when you participate
                                        in the freedoms this license grants you,
                                        when you use the GPL, there is encoded
                                        in the license a support for this sense
                                        of the natural right of free software.
                                        We, GNU, can&#8217;t encode that for the
                                        world, but for the software that we
                                        write these rights are inalienable.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        But as I said those were difficult
                                        times. There was a great deal of
                                        pressure. People were trying to
                                        understand what open source meant.
                                        People still struggle with questions:
                                        how would an economy function, how would
                                        a programmer get a job, if this is as
                                        successful as people hoped will we all
                                        just be out of jobs? Other questions
                                        were: who will write the software that
                                        no one wants to write? How can I,
                                        embedded in a situation where I
                                        can&#8217;t actually use only free
                                        software &#8212; remember at this time
                                        there was no way to use completely free
                                        software &#8212; how can I assert a duty
                                        to do something that is not possible?
                                        How can I be useful unless I interface
                                        with all these proprietary things? If I
                                        deal with companies which aren&#8217;t
                                        comfortable with open source software,
                                        then what? After all, open source seemed
                                        only barely plausible at this time. It
                                        was not an easy argument to make.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        And all this was before the term
                                        &quot;open source&quot; really took hold
                                        as a distinct idea. That itself is an
                                        interesting story. There was a time
                                        during this marketing period when there
                                        arose a kind of terminology divide
                                        &#8212; free software vs. open source
                                        software. The terminology divide was
                                        that the &quot;free&quot; in free
                                        software implied you couldn&#8217;t
                                        charge anything, that made people think
                                        about price, might even imply cheapness.
                                        Open source directly refers to
                                        programming, uses the feel-good term
                                        &quot;open&quot;, and doesn&#8217;t
                                        sound too revolutionary. But besides
                                        that there was also a substantial
                                        philosophical difference about the value
                                        of the software itself.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        So there was a difference in how things
                                        were going to be pitched, but also a
                                        difference in what people thought the
                                        general value of this project was. From
                                        GNU and Richard Stallman there was the
                                        notion that this was right because it
                                        was right; it was a moral imperative.
                                        The virtue of what we build is in its
                                        freedom; if it is also technically
                                        superior then that&#8217;s great, but it
                                        is not how we should judge our success.
                                        We were giving people
                                        self-determination: programmer
                                        self-determination, user
                                        self-determination&#8230; on the open
                                        source side the argument was that this
                                        is a good way to create software.
                                        Programmers working together can do
                                        better work. With many eyes all bugs are
                                        shallow. All working together,
                                        we&#8217;ll work faster, you get the
                                        benefit of free contributions from all
                                        sorts of people. People were clamouring
                                        to get all these proprietary companies
                                        with failing software products to open
                                        source their software; miracles will
                                        occur! What you thought was useless will
                                        regain value! You&#8217;ll reattain
                                        relevance!
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        The open source and free software
                                        philosophical divide: on one side
                                        practical concerns, on the other moral.
                                        And this is what I want to talk about
                                        later: can we find a moral argument for
                                        these practical concerns?
                                    </p>

                                        The basic free/open disagreement
                                        continues in debates over licenses: the
                                        GPL vs. the BSD and other permissive
                                        licenses. If you read the

                                        engineer&#8217;s license.

                                        So these two licenses in many ways
                                        became a focus and definition of free
                                        and open source software. If you look at
                                        the
                                        <a

                                            >Open Source Initiative</a
                                        >, which has served to define what
                                        &quot;open source&quot; means, it is
                                        basically just a
                                        <a
                                            class="reference external"

                                        >. If you use one of those licenses, the
                                        software is open source, if not then it
                                        is closed.

                                        I think this is disappointing, because
                                        licenses are just law, and law is not
                                        very interesting. A law tells you what
                                        you shouldn&#8217;t do, it doesn&#8217;t
                                        tell you what you should do. When both
                                        sides are talking about freedom, the
                                        licenses just define freedom as the lack
                                        of certain restrictions. Take away those
                                        restrictions and voila, you are
                                        free&#8230; as though we are all just
                                        bundles of freedom waiting to be
                                        released.

                                        With licenses we have a negative
                                        definition of our community. Either
                                        license you choose, the license feels
                                        like a reaction against closed source
                                        software. If you can imagine a world in
                                        which there was no copyright, where our
                                        platforms were all setup to distribute
                                        source code in modifiable forms, where
                                        everything was open and everything was
                                        free, then none of these licenses would
                                        matter. No one would be compelled to
                                        create the GPL in such a world; we
                                        wouldn&#8217;t advocate for copyright
                                        just so we can secure people&#8217;s
                                        freedoms. In that kind of world all this
                                        licensing disappears. And this
                                        isn&#8217;t even so weird a world. You
                                        can pretend there&#8217;s no copyright
                                        now. Maybe you have to reverse-engineer
                                        some stuff. There&#8217;s lots of places
                                        in the world where no one really gives a
                                        damn about copyright. But those places
                                        don&#8217;t feel open source to me, they
                                        don&#8217;t feel that more free. We
                                        aren&#8217;t made unfree just by legal
                                        restrictions; freedom is something we
                                        have to actively grasp.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        I don&#8217;t think what we do is
                                        predicated on copyright. Indeed, many
                                        projects are comfortable with an
                                        entirely confused copyright ownership.
                                        This causes very few problems. A focus
                                        on licensing makes us into a reaction
                                        against proprietary software, where we
                                        allow proprietary software and its
                                        makers to define what it means to be
                                        <em>us</em>.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        This concerns me because it isn&#8217;t
                                        just about formal definitions and
                                        terminology. When I say
                                        <em>what do I do</em>, I say I am an
                                        open source programmer. That&#8217;s not
                                        just an attribute, like saying that my
                                        hair is brown. Open source is a way in
                                        which I see myself, a way I think about
                                        my craft, my profession, and a way I
                                        justify the work I put out to the world:
                                        that it aligns with these values. So
                                        it&#8217;s very important to me what
                                        these values are. And it&#8217;s
                                        frustrating to see open source defined
                                        in reaction to closed source software,
                                        because personally I don&#8217;t care
                                        about closed source software that much.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        I never really cared much about fighting
                                        Microsoft, and I certainly don&#8217;t
                                        care now. I see myself as a builder;
                                        this is what always drew me towards
                                        programming. The desire to build new
                                        things. This is our privilege as
                                        programmers, that we always have the
                                        opportunity to build new things. If
                                        we&#8217;re asked to do something again
                                        and again and again, you always have the
                                        power to do it in a more abstract way,
                                        to generalize it away, until you can
                                        start to ignore the requests and move on
                                        to another problem. This is something
                                        unique thing to computer programming.
                                        These are the kind of unique attributes
                                        that make us different as a profession
                                        and as a craft than just about anything
                                        I can think of.
                                    </p>

                                        So I&#8217;m frustrated. Here we are
                                        stuck in this notion of a license as a
                                        self-definition. I want to find a new
                                        self-definition, a new idea of what
                                        makes us us.

                                        I was saying about Django, the community
                                        is not particularly enthusiastic about
                                        philosophy. Or maybe I should say,
                                        Django&#8217;s philosophy is: the value
                                        of the code is the thing you do with it.
                                        These abstract discussions about
                                        architecture, reuse, big plans&#8230;
                                        instead, Django as a community
                                        encourages you to keep your head in the
                                        code, think about what you want to do,
                                        and then do it. Don&#8217;t shave yaks.

                                        But I&#8217;m not here to tell you to
                                        get philosophical about freedom, or to
                                        berate you for a functional definition
                                        of value. I&#8217;d like to look at this
                                        community for what it is, and ask: what
                                        is the value system here? Maybe it
                                        isn&#8217;t described, but I also
                                        don&#8217;t think it is therefore
                                        absent.

                                        So&#8230; when I say I identify as an
                                        open source programmer, what is it that
                                        I am identifying as?
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        I don&#8217;t believe licensing makes
                                        something truly open source. There was
                                        this clamour in the past to get
                                        companies to open source their products.
                                        This has stopped, because all the
                                        software that got open source sucked.
                                        It&#8217;s just not very interesting to
                                        have a closed source program get open
                                        sourced. It doesn&#8217;t help anyone,
                                        because the way closed source software
                                        is created in a very different way than
                                        open source software. The result is a
                                        software base that just does not engage
                                        people in a way to make it a valid piece
                                        of software for further development. At
                                        least not unless you have something
                                        peculiar going on&#8230; an economic
                                        force like you had behind Mozilla that
                                        could push things forward even in the
                                        midst of all the problems that project
                                        had. One might even ask, is Mozilla
                                        still suffering from that proprietary
                                        background, when something like KHTML or
                                        WebKit which came from a truly open
                                        source background, and has been a more
                                        successful basis for collaboration and
                                        new work.

                                        So whatever it is that makes something
                                        open source, it&#8217;s not just
                                        licensing. Given a codebase, we
                                        can&#8217;t necessarily expect that
                                        someone going to care about it and love
                                        it and make it successful. A lot of
                                        people have described what makes a
                                        successful open source codebase;
                                        I&#8217;d like to talk some about what
                                        the communities look like.

                                        Open source works as a fairly loose
                                        federation of people together. Everyone
                                        involved is involved as an individual.
                                        Companies seldom participate directly in
                                        open source. Companies might use open
                                        source, they might sponsor people to
                                        work on open source projects, they might
                                        ask an employee to act as a liason. But
                                        it&#8217;s not cool to submit a bug as a
                                        company. You submit it as yourself. If
                                        someone asks a question, you answer as
                                        yourself. You don&#8217;t join a mailing
                                        list under the company&#8217;s name. And
                                        even when you put a company name on a
                                        product, it&#8217;s hard to relate to
                                        the product as a
                                        <em>project</em> without some sense of
                                        authorship, of the underlying
                                        individual.

                                        There&#8217;s also very little money
                                        being moved about. There&#8217;s not a
                                        lot of commercial contracts. You might
                                        get software, you might get bug fixes,
                                        you might get reputation, but
                                        there&#8217;s seldom any formal way
                                        setup to introduce commerce into the
                                        community. How many projects let you pay
                                        to escalate a bug? Even if everyone
                                        involved might like that, it&#8217;s
                                        just not there.

                                        But I want to get back to individuals.
                                        How things are created is not that
                                        someone determines a set of priorities,
                                        lays them out, then people work on
                                        implementation based on those
                                        priorities. That of course is how things
                                        typically work at a company, as an
                                        employee. But open source software and
                                        open source projects are created because
                                        an individual looks at the world and
                                        sees an opportunity to create something
                                        they think should exist. Maybe it
                                        resolves a tension they&#8217;ve felt in
                                        their work, maybe it allows that person
                                        to respond to the priorities from above
                                        better, but the decision to implement
                                        lies primarily with the implementor.
                                        When someone makes a decision to move a
                                        product from simply private code &#8212;
                                        regardless of the license &#8212; to
                                        being a real open source project, that
                                        decision is almost always driven by the
                                        programmer.

                                        Underneath most open source work there
                                        is a passion for the craft itself. This
                                        is what leads to a certain kind of
                                        quality that is not the norm in closed
                                        source software. It&#8217;s not
                                        necessarily less bugs or more features,
                                        but a pride in the expression itself. A
                                        sense of aesthetic that applies to even
                                        the individual lines of software, not
                                        just to the functionality produced. This
                                        kind of aesthetic defies scheduling and
                                        relies on personal motivation.

                                        As open source programmers we are not
                                        first concerned with how a task fits
                                        into institutions, how a task can be
                                        directed by a hierarchy or an authority,
                                        or even how the task can be directed by
                                        economics. The tasks that we take on are
                                        motivated by aesthetic, by personal
                                        excitement and drive.

                                        We are also in a profession where there
                                        is little stasis. If you can create
                                        something once, you can create it a
                                        thousand times, through iteration or
                                        abstraction. You can constantly make
                                        your own effort obsolete. A good
                                        programmer is always trying to work
                                        themselves out of a job.

                                        Djangocon didn&#8217;t exist a couple
                                        years ago. Django didn&#8217;t exist
                                        only a few years ago. And I don&#8217;t
                                        think there&#8217;s anyone here who
                                        thinks that, having found Django,
                                        they&#8217;ve reached some terminal
                                        point. It&#8217;s hardly even a point to
                                        pause. There&#8217;s a constant churn, a
                                        constant push forward that we&#8217;re
                                        all participating in.

                                        As a result it&#8217;s demanded of us
                                        that we have a tight feedback cycle,
                                        that education is not a formal affair
                                        but a constant process in our own work.
                                        There&#8217;s a constant churn, and a
                                        professional sense we&#8217;re kind of
                                        like fruit flies. A generation of
                                        knowledge and practice is short enough
                                        that the evolution is rapid and visible.
                                        You don&#8217;t have to be particularly
                                        old or even thoughtful to see the
                                        changes. You can look back even on your
                                        own work and on communities to see
                                        changes over the course of a couple
                                        years, to see changes and shifts and a
                                        maturing of the work and the community.

                                        Another attribute of open source: our
                                        communities are ad hoc and temporary. We

                                        split, recombine, and we constantly
                                        rewrite. There is both an arrogance and
                                        a humility to this. We are arrogant to
                                        think This Time Will Be Different. But
                                        we are humble enough to know that last
                                        time wasn&#8217;t different either.
                                        There will always be a next thing,
                                        another technique, another vision.

                                        Because of the ad hoc nature of the
                                        communities, we don&#8217;t have long
                                        collective plans. The ad hoc community
                                        may be the intersection of different
                                        <em>personal</em> long range plans, a
                                        time when different visions somehow
                                        coincide in a similar implementation. Or
                                        perhaps it&#8217;s just serendipity, or
                                        leadership. But we make each decision
                                        anew. I believe this protects us from
                                        being misled by sunk costs. The idea of
                                        a sunk cost is that when you make an
                                        investment, you&#8217;ve put in effort,
                                        that effort is gone. Just because
                                        you&#8217;ve put in effort doesn&#8217;t
                                        mean you&#8217;ve received value, or
                                        that the path of investment remains
                                        valid. But as humans we are highly
                                        reluctant to let go of a plan that
                                        we&#8217;ve invested in. We have a hard
                                        time recognizing sunk costs.

                                        I believe in our developer community we
                                        approach our work with sufficient
                                        humility that we can see our work as
                                        simply a sunk cost. Our effort does not
                                        entitle us to any particular success, so
                                        we can choose new directions with more
                                        rationality than an institution. Though
                                        it can also be argued that we are too
                                        quick to dismiss past investments; there
                                        is a youthfulness even to our oldest
                                        members.

                                        We do not have hierachies with decision
                                        makers above implementors. Some people
                                        have veto power (a BDFL), but no one has
                                        <em>executive</em> power. A decision
                                        only is valid paired with an
                                        implementation. You cannot decide
                                        something based on information you
                                        <em>wish</em> was true; you cannot
                                        decide on something then blame the
                                        implementors for getting it wrong. We
                                        are in this sense vertically integrated,
                                        decision and implementation are
                                        combined. The result may be success or
                                        failure, commitment or abandonment, but
                                        the hierarchy is flat and the feedback
                                        loop is very tight. And if an individual
                                        feels stymied, there is always another
                                        community to join or create.

                                        Though this is only a start, it&#8217;s
                                        these attributes that I would prefer
                                        define us, not licenses.

                                        I also would like that this could be a

                                        Why would we, as programmers, be unique
                                        or worthy of emulation? I mentioned
                                        before that we constantly work ourselves
                                        out of our job. We also create the tools
                                        we use to do the work. We define the
                                        structure of our communities.
                                        We&#8217;re consistently finding novel
                                        ways to use the internet build those
                                        communities. It&#8217;s not that we as a
                                        group are somehow uniquely wise, or some
                                        Greatest Generation, but we have become
                                        distinctly self-empowered. There is a
                                        uniqueness to us. It might be a
                                        coincidence of history, but it is there.

                                        A question I might then ask: is there a
                                        political meaning to this? This is the
                                        form our craft takes, but does that mean
                                        anything? We work with computers,
                                        someone else might work with their
                                        hands, an artist considers color, a
                                        salesperson learns how to put on a good
                                        smile.

                                    <p>
                                        I haven&#8217;t quite figured this out
                                        yet, but I think there&#8217;s something
                                        in this. Over the years I&#8217;ve found
                                        myself looking at politics in a
                                        increasingly technocratic lens; more so
                                        than as a liberal, conservative, or
                                        radical. That is, instead of looking at
                                        the world and seeing what&#8217;s wrong
                                        about it, and explaining it in terms of
                                        a class struggle, a cultural conflict,
                                        in terms of advocacy or invented enemies
                                        or allies, I see a system that just
                                        works how it works. It&#8217;s more like
                                        gears than like a war. The gears turn
                                        and sometimes we don&#8217;t like what
                                        results, but it&#8217;s not malice.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        But I also don&#8217;t think we are
                                        slaves to the technical functioning of
                                        the system. None of us are inevitably
                                        caught up in some statistical outcome of
                                        markets, or condemned by money in
                                        politics or advertising. At any time we
                                        can say Here Is What I Believe, and it
                                        is as powerful as any of those other
                                        things; we&#8217;re too quick to look at
                                        the people who aren&#8217;t asserting a
                                        belief, who aren&#8217;t asserting their
                                        own potential for self-empowerment and
                                        direction, and we ignore everyone who is
                                        aware and concerned and attempting
                                        self-determination. We are at danger of
                                        ignoring the great potential around us.

                                        It is in this sense that I wonder not
                                        just how we can spread the idea of
                                        freedom through licensing, which has
                                        inspired the free culture movement, but
                                        also how we can spread this idea and
                                        practice of individual action, of
                                        combining decision and implementation,
                                        and of constant ad hoc collaboration.

                                        I&#8217;m not just thinking of politics
                                        directly, but of professional lives as
                                        well. Right now we&#8217;re talking
                                        about healthcare. It&#8217;s a very
                                        political issue, and yet healthcare is
                                        ultimately a profession, a job, an
                                        action. How we work on that,
                                        collaboratively or not, is as political
                                        as any aspect of the system.

                                        One anecdote that made me think about
                                        this, is a task I had that involved
                                        putting authentication in front of a
                                        mailing list. The mailing list happened
                                        to be for wound, ostomy, and continence
                                        nurses, and in the process of the job I
                                        read a bunch of their emails from the
                                        archives. As wound nurses they spent a
                                        lot of time asking about specific
                                        questions &#8212; maybe a wound that
                                        wouldn&#8217;t heal, they kept draining
                                        the puss and it discharge kept
                                        reappearing, and did anyone have ideas
                                        of the next technique to try?

                                    <p>
                                        Reading a few of these I could tell this
                                        was a profession where you needed a
                                        strong stomach. But the whole
                                        interaction, the way they described
                                        problems, the way people came back with
                                        answers, it felt very familiar to me. It
                                        was the same kind of discussions I could
                                        imagine having about Linux
                                        administration or debugging. And the
                                        goals were similar. No one was making
                                        money, there wasn&#8217;t really
                                        reputation on the line, it was just
                                        people who wanted to help their patients
                                        and who wanted to help each other.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        So that mailing list was great, but
                                        it&#8217;s unfortunately not that
                                        common. And if nurses were open to that
                                        kind of collaboration, doctors
                                        don&#8217;t seem nearly as ready. And
                                        there&#8217;s a lot of professions where
                                        there&#8217;s not even that
                                        thoughtfulness. I believe in any
                                        profession there&#8217;s the ability to
                                        do it well or not; there&#8217;s nothing
                                        so rote or well understood that
                                        there&#8217;s no room for improvement.
                                        It doesn&#8217;t have to be fancy
                                        technology, it can just be a technique,
                                        a way of managing work; all things worth
                                        doing have some way of improving, by
                                        bringing in this same sense of
                                        collaboration and individual action and
                                        thoughtfulness, all things can be
                                        implemented better than they are now.
                                        What I&#8217;m describing isn&#8217;t a
                                        fancy new website for professionals, but
                                        about people look at their own work
                                        differently; the technology is not the
                                        hard part.

                                    <h2>The Political</h2>
                                    <p>
                                        Changing how people look at their work I
                                        think is political. It involves
                                        individual empowerment. It can mean
                                        economic change. I also think it
                                        deemphasizes competition. When I think
                                        about Pylons, or Django, or TurboGears,
                                        or WSGI, there&#8217;s competition, but
                                        it&#8217;s also collegial. There&#8217;s
                                        not really that much of a sense of
                                        survival. We aren&#8217;t carving out
                                        territories, we&#8217;re just finding
                                        paths to some unknown end. If something
                                        else wins out, well, we&#8217;re all
                                        just along for the ride. In the end it
                                        is inevitable that something else other
                                        than what <em>any</em> of us are working
                                        on will win out over what any of us are
                                        doing. Just like everyone eventually
                                        loses their job at least to death or
                                        retirement. There&#8217;s no permanency.
                                        But if we can be individually more
                                        productive, it doesn&#8217;t have to
                                        mean we&#8217;ve put someone else out.
                                        It <em>could</em> mean we all, all of
                                        society, all of humanity, just do
                                        <em>more</em>. Why do we have to set
                                        ourselves against the Chinese, or Europe
                                        against the U.S.? Why do we have to set
                                        ourselves one economy against another?
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Or consider government itself:
                                        we&#8217;re obsessed with our elected
                                        officials, but of course government is
                                        far larger than just the elected
                                        officials. The U.S. Federal Government
                                        alone has 1.8 million employees. We
                                        constantly threaten to institute
                                        accountability, meaning that we&#8217;ll
                                        poke and prod government workers from
                                        the outside and expect better outcomes.
                                        That we expect anything to come of this
                                        is absurd, but somehow accountability
                                        has become an easy alternative to
                                        constructive suggestions for
                                        improvement.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        But why shouldn&#8217;t we expect that
                                        government workers <em>want</em> to do
                                        better? I believe in fact those people
                                        doing the work are especially well
                                        equiped to figure out <em>how</em> to do
                                        better. But it&#8217;s not automatic.
                                        They aren&#8217;t empowered in a system
                                        that is so exceptionally hierarchical.
                                        Lately we&#8217;ve seen lots of efforts
                                        to ask the public how to do government
                                        work better, but we&#8217;ve seen
                                        nothing asking <em>government</em> how
                                        to do government work better.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        These are the kinds of things I&#8217;d
                                        like to see us all think about more:
                                        open source has done incredible things,
                                        has inspired new ideas, about more than
                                        just software and engineering, but I
                                        think we have yet more things to give.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>Thank you for your time.</p>

                                        Ian have you read Clay Shirky&#8217;s
                                        essay &#8220;Institutions versus
                                        Collaboration&#8221;? Do a google
                                        search, there is a video at TED where he
                                        lays out the thesis that we&#8217;re in
                                        the early stages of a universal cultural
                                        shift regarding how we work together
                                        nearly exactly like what you describe.
                                        He compares it to the shift in Europe
                                        from 1200 AD, where political authority
                                        was based on divine right to the treaty
                                        of Aachen when the notion of secular
                                        rule was firmly established. It took 400
                                        years for that shift to happen. He
                                        believes our current shift will take
                                        about 50-100 years.

                                            <p>
                                                I think I&#8217;ve read that
                                                (the TED talk is very familiar
                                                to me, at least), though not
                                                while I was writing this. I did
                                                also think about his book Here
                                                Comes Everybody, where he talked
                                                about some of these things. For
                                                some reason Clay Shirky
                                                doesn&#8217;t talk much about
                                                open source software production.
                                                There&#8217;s perhaps something
                                                less exciting about software
                                                production than politics or
                                                art&#8230; but we&#8217;re also
                                                years and years ahead of those
                                                areas, and our output is
                                                concretely and measurably
                                                useful, whereas politics and art
                                                are hard to judge. For instance,
                                                people were excited about what
                                                happened with the Iranian
                                                election and Twitter, but
                                                it&#8217;s unclear that the
                                                internet served any constructive
                                                purpose at all (it&#8217;s
                                                possible that it helped start a
                                                nascent movement that will rise
                                                up again in Iran, or that it
                                                made Iran seem more empathetic
                                                to Americans, but the jury is
                                                still out on that stuff &#8212;
                                                there was nothing immediately
                                                positive about the outcome of
                                                that event).

                                                        Still, there is much in
                                                        the implications of what
                                                        you describe in the

                                                        Anarcho-Syndicalism. I
                                                        kind of hate using those
                                                        terms because nobody
                                                        seems able to use them

                                                        misunderstanding them;
                                                        allowing their
                                                        over-hyped exponential
                                                        examples to define them.

                                        posting it here. I found it very
                                        interesting.

                                        Great post, thanks. I&#8217;ve been
                                        thinking a lot about why we are worthy
                                        of emulation and I found two more
                                        reasons:
                                    </p>

                                    <ul>
                                        <li>
                                            <p>
                                                Code is the best way to control
                                                a complex system. For an x86
                                                server we use software code, for
                                                our government and judiciary
                                                system we use legal code, but
                                                they are really quite alike.
                                                Generalizing a bit, we are good
                                                at writing code to control
                                                complex systems. Right now,
                                                we&#8217;re all focused on
                                                complex Turing machines, but
                                                that could change, especially as
                                                those non-Turing systems will
                                                have all their data accessible
                                                by Turing machines.

                                                Our craft is unique in that the
                                                cost of destruction is nil, so
                                                coding evolved to include
                                                refactoring as part of the
                                                development process. I
                                                don&#8217;t think there&#8217;s
                                                any other craft or profession
                                                out there where you are not
                                                ashamed of throwing away your
                                                old work, but it&#8217;s really
                                                all right if your professions is
                                                focused on knowledge.

                                        Fantastic essay, thank you for posting!
                                    </p>

                                        I share your technocratic view of
                                        government, or any significantly large
                                        organization. People always overestimate
                                        how much control and power the leader(s)
                                        have, but if the leaders do a good job
                                        then they have very little (personal)
                                        power at all. All decisions are be
                                        reasoned, agreed upon, and executed, as
                                        if obeying the laws of physics. Like
                                        gears in a machine.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        I view myself as an Open Source
                                        developer, a builder (or creator). I
                                        can&#8217;t remember a time when I
                                        hesitated posting the source code to my
                                        creations, mostly because I didn&#8217;t
                                        see the source code as the part that
                                        contains its value, but rather the idea
                                        it represents. I want the idea to
                                        flourish, even if someone else becomes
                                        responsible for it.
                                    </p>

                                        Finally, I very much enjoyed the
                                        anecdote about the nursing mailing list.
                                        I&#8217;ve heard similar impressions
                                        from nurses and their perspective on the
                                        battle between their opinion and that of
                                        the doctors. My impression is that the
                                        nursing movement is much more agile and
                                        progressive (very similar to the open
                                        source community), whereas MD&#8217;s
                                        are a proprietary corpus of R&amp;D and
                                        reputation.
                                    </p>

                                        Thank you for sharing your thoughts and
                                        your code.

                                        &#8220;What I’m describing isn’t a fancy
                                        new website for professionals, but about
                                        people looking at their own work
                                        differently; the technology is not the
                                        hard part.&#8221;
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        Yes. The open source style of organizing
                                        work, and of narrating work in a
                                        transparent way, is a key innovation
                                        that can and should spread to every
                                        profession.
                                    </p>

                                        I&#8217;ve been trying for a long time
                                        to use the open source model to
                                        illustrate this point &#8212; because
                                        it&#8217;s the best real-world example
                                        of it. But it&#8217;s hard because
                                        people both inside and outside the
                                        software world keep wanting to view the
                                        model through the lens of tribal
                                        warfare.

                                        Thank you for his refreshing read! This
                                        is a jewel I will definately share with
                                        my fellow developers in Academia — who
                                        sometimes forget that sharing of
                                        knowledge is a good thing!

                                        A relate post is &#8220;We No Longer
                                        Need Power&#8221; from Bruce Eckel and
                                        the comments there. I must say I read
                                        you post yesterday but I was not able to
                                        get the deep meaning of it. Only
                                        skimming throw the text I got the
                                        impression that you feel that a change
                                        is going to occur but don&#8217;t see
                                        the direction or how to focus people to
                                        go in some direction.

                                        I think we should learn the value of
                                        symbols, for example what is the meaning
                                        of a coin for society. We depend very
                                        much of such concepts, imagine there
                                        were not possible way to guarantee
                                        secure economic transactions, or that
                                        legal status are not respected by people
                                        any more &#8230;
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        In order to change we should be able to
                                        appreciate the kernel features that are
                                        at the core of our society. Such change
                                        require a deep knowledge of the human
                                        nature, an appreciation that I think we
                                        will never get when a person is only a
                                        mascaraed to live in a tribe.

                                        Thanks, Ian. It&#8217;s nice to hear
                                        introspectives on FOSS again. I miss
                                        those. Last year, I posted

                                        which is similar in nature to your post,
                                        and there wasn&#8217;t as much of a
                                        response as I expected.
                                    </p>

                                        I&#8217;m glad to see other people
                                        thinking deeply about these things.

                                        in which I admitted that I&#8217;m
                                        thankful for both open and closed source
                                        video games. I still wonder if that
                                        applies to the entire software world.
                                        Part of me thinks it does, but the
                                        little Stallman who sits on my shoulder
                                        keeps calling me a sellout ;)

                                        Nicely said. You might find &#8220;The
                                        Success of Open Source&#8221; by Steven
                                        Weber an interesting read. It&#8217;s a
                                        few years old, but touches on quite a
                                        bit of history and some of the
                                        motivations for participants in a few of
                                        the larger OSS projects. He also does
                                        some analysis of the difference in
                                        culture between BSD and GPL licensed
                                        projects.

                                        evolution of open-source technology.
                                        Tremendously insightful!

                                        I found this post just checking out what
                                        folks are saying about
                                        &#8220;yaks&#8221;. At first I thought
                                        it was just another &#8220;yak
                                        shaving&#8221; post. Somehow reading the
                                        first few paragraphs hooked me. I am not
                                        a programmer, just a simple yak rancher.
                                        Still I was fascinated by the political
                                        point of view. I ended up following most
                                        of the comments. Thanks for a great post
                                        and somehow broadening my thoughts on
                                        software and politics!

                                        Very interesting post, which lets me
                                        focus on a difference I didn&#8217;t
                                        recognize that well between Open Source
                                        and Free Software. I liked the political
                                        aspects you mentioned, too. On my point
                                        of view, if a kind of revolution is
                                        still possible in our (over-)developed
                                        world, it will be a digital one!

                                        Things change. For exp. I live in
                                        country (Lithuania) where in XIX century
                                        we had book smugglers &#8211;
                                        That&#8217;s right, books were illegal
                                        an they were brought from abroad by
                                        smugglers. Of course they were criminals
                                        or pirates by messurements of those
                                        times. But now they are heroes and we
                                        pay tribute for them &#8211; for
                                        bringing culture to our people during
                                        those dark times. So &#8211; think the
                                        same with piracy now. people like billy
                                        gatesy call these people pirates, they
                                        are steeling their money. But from other
                                        side &#8211; people from third world,
                                        they will never get chance to same
                                        technology, same knowledge and culture
                                        as rich nations do. What if piracy can
                                        change this &#8211; lead us to better
                                        world, where every man has a right to
                                        read, use, or entertain with content
                                        that was created by mankind.
