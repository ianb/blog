        <div class="document">
            <p>
                The whole web/WSGIKit/Rails thing has me thinking about the
                steps to get an application up and running, and I want to make
                that work really easily. I feel like WSGIKit does that fairly
                decently right now (no documentation, but that will come soon!)
                -- but I think SQLObject is also a key component in the equation
                (for any framework that uses SQLObject). So I've been thinking
                about how to make it easier to manage.
            </p>
            <p>
                The first thing I've done is
                <tt class="docutils literal"
                    ><span class="pre">ConnectionHub</span></tt
                >, which will become the &quot;default&quot; connection. It's
                just a way to register a connection after class creation, so you
                can (probably based on configuration) connect all your tables to
                the same database, after the modules have been loaded. It will
                look something like:
            </p>
            <pre class="literal-block">
import sqlobject

sqlobject.hub.processConnection = connectionForURI(
    'mysql://localhost/testdb')
</pre
            >
            <p>
                But frameworks can probably put in that glue on their own, so
                you can just define your classes with no boilerplate
                configuration or glue. This is something people are already
                doing in some projects (like sqlo for Zope 3 -- a project which
                seems entirely invisible to Google), but this turns it into a
                supported pattern. And it's just plain easier. You can register
                connections globally (<tt class="docutils literal"
                    ><span class="pre">processConnection</span></tt
                >) or per-thread (<tt class="docutils literal"
                    ><span class="pre">threadConnection</span></tt
                >).
            </p>
            <p>
                The other thing I've started work on is a
                <tt class="docutils literal"
                    ><span class="pre">sqlobject-admin</span></tt
                >
                command-line client. The program can find your SQLObject classes
                and create and drop tables, as well as show you the SQL
                <tt class="docutils literal"
                    ><span class="pre">CREATE</span></tt
                >
                statements and check your data definitions against the actual
                tables in the database (an imperfect comparison, but at least it
                can show obvious differences).
            </p>
            <p>
                Still to be written for
                <tt class="docutils literal"
                    ><span class="pre">sqlobject-admin</span></tt
                >
                is something that records the SQL
                <tt class="docutils literal"
                    ><span class="pre">CREATE</span></tt
                >
                statements and gives them a &quot;version&quot; (which doesn't
                necessarily match with your software's version), and also stores
                that version number in the database (in some special table).
                Later when you do development elsewhere and have to bring a
                database in sync with the latest version of your code, the tool
                will be able to query the database for its version and run
                upgrade scripts (that you hand-code). The operations are
                actually pretty crude, but it's mostly just to codify a process
                that allows for more agile and automated database evolution.

            <div class="document">
                <p>Hey Ian,</p>
                <p>
                    actually today I was doing my considerations about switching
                    to Ruby on Rails and there is really one thing keeping me
                    from switching to the <em>dark</em> side of the Rails
                    framework: lack of production ready PostgreSQL drivers. Ok,
                    it's just a suspect. The
                    <a class="reference" href="http://download.rubyonrails.com/"
                        >http://download.rubyonrails.com/</a
                    >
                    site shows on their left column some links to recommended
                    libraries and, guess what, their development is hanged since
                    2003 (<a
                        class="reference"
                        href="http://www.postgresql.jp/interfaces/ruby/"
                        >http://www.postgresql.jp/interfaces/ruby/</a
                    >) and supports PostgreSQL up to 7.2. So I searched a bit
                    more and found
                    <a
                        class="reference"
                        href="http://wiki.rubyonrails.org/rails/show/PostgreSQL"
                        >http://wiki.rubyonrails.org/rails/show/PostgreSQL</a
                    >
                    which doesn't mention how Pg 8 is supported. So I google a
                    bit and find a host claiming:
                </p>
                <p>
                    postgres-pr (0.3.6) A pure Ruby interface to the PostgreSQL
                    (&gt;= 7.4) database
                </p>
                <p>
                    So, wassup in the Ruby world with the Pg 8 support? You, for
                    sure, know this stuff better than me. Maybe the PostgreSQL
                    engine hasn't changed that much from version 7 to 8(having
                    added only a few things beside Win support) so this maybe is
                    a non-issue. But still I wouldn't like to get burnt loosing
                    data in some of my tables for some unsupported driver I've
                    used because there's no alternative to use MySQL.
                </p>
                <p>
                    But, probably, I'll decide to take my chances and switch
                    anyway.

                        Beats me, really. But I do know that the Postgres driver
                        situation has always been a little odd on Python, and I
                        guess that there may be some real technical reason for
                        that, between psycopg, Popy, PygreSQL, and maybe one
                        other driver. Now things are pretty stable, but it took
                        a while for that to get figured out.
