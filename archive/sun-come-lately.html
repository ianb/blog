            </p>
            <p>That sounds inflamatory. Sorry.</p>
            <p>I mean:</p>
            <ol class="arabic simple">
                <li>
                    It's pathetic that Sun is trying to catch up to
                    <em>Microsoft</em> on open source dynamic language
                    environments. Catching up to <strong>Microsoft</strong>?
                </li>
                <li>
                    It's also pathetic because they probably could have hired
                    Jim Hugunin years ago when he was working on Jython, and
                    both made Jython a well-supported tool and the JVM a more
                    dynamic-language-friendly environment. They're playing
                    catch-up now when they could have played themselves as a
                    leader before.
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                So, apparently lacking any vision whatsoever, Sun waits until
                <a

                >
                to actually put real effort into the dynamic language community.
                Of course better late than never, and I have no criticisms for
                investing in JRuby (nor is this a criticism of JRuby or Ruby),
                but but the whole timing comes off as merely reactionary.

                    I think you're right, Ian. To me sounds like they happened
                    to notice the virtues of dynamic programming and trying to
                    fill the gap. What I despise most in this all stuff is their
                    developers yelling &quot;jruby is cool!&quot;,
                    &quot;ironpython is cool!&quot; when the day before they
                    were trowing mud onto Python or Ruby because &quot;dynamic
                    is slow&quot; or whatever. Anyway, let things be :-)

                    Sun is a big company, requiring many people to work in
                    concert to achieve anything. While it is possible that
                    IronPython was part of the motivation for throwing support
                    behind JRuby, I doubt that it was the largest motivation for
                    the majority of people involved. Also, from Sun's point of
                    view, getting behind JRuby also makes more sense than
                    getting behind Jython, on account of all the Java
                    programmers currently getting excited about Ruby and Rails.
                    I'm hoping that much dynamic goodness will come of this for
                    JDK 7 or 8.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Still, I agree that it is was short-sighted of Sun to pass
                    on getting behind Jython back in 2001 or 2002.

                        Honestly I don't know what Sun would do to get behind
                        Jython now; the project doesn't have a champion anymore.
                        So I don't fault them for getting behind JRuby now
                        instead of Jython. But I think they were pretty dumb to
                        let Jython wither in the way it has. And I don't know
                        what it takes for Sun to get behind something, but all
                        they're doing is spending a few bucks to hire some
                        people so they can focus on a project that should be
                        strategic for Sun. This is exactly the kind of thing
                        that <em>should</em> be easy for Sun to do.

                            Sun is a big company. Tim was the guy who made it
                            happen, and he has some really cogent comments on
                            why it was JRuby, and what would be needed for Sun
                            to hire another language guru.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            As the Python FIT maintainer, I've had a request to
                            make it run under Jython. I'm not going to do it for
                            two reasons, one of which is that I'm not a Java
                            guy. The whole ecosystem is a foreign language for
                            me.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The other is that my current support base (minimum
                            Python level) is 2.3. AFAIK, Jython is still stuck
                            on 2.1. If someone wants to step up to the plate and
                            make it run with Jython (or IronPython or PyPy for
                            that matter) I'll certainly discuss applying the
                            patches. However, I'm not going to go back on the
                            minimum level of Python required.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The takehome is that if you want Sun to support a
                            couple of Jython developers, talk to Tim. But I
                            suspect that the people in question will have to
                            show their interest in very concrete ways first.

                    Sun has a history of letting cool little language work go
                    unnoticed.
                </p>
                <p>
                    15 years ago they had an entire windowing system with a
                    built-in forth interpreter (NeWS) and let it die in favor of
                    the whole X / open look / Motif mess. At the same time more
                    or less completely ignored the cool perl and shell
                    extensions that were going on (anyone remember windowed
                    Ksh?).
                </p>
                <p>
                    They had a great scheme shell with all sorts of neat stuff
                    but it languished and died at the same time MSFT was
                    teaching the world to love VB and fostering an entire VB
                    addon market. They did learn their marketing lession from
                    that somewhat with Java while completely ignoring python.
                    They had Tcl for a while but never did anything with it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now they are starting to notice python and ruby, which is
                    good because at least the python and ruby developers have a
                    good history of taking cool features from functional
                    languages little by little. But where of all places is some
                    of the best functional language work being done these days?
                    Give you a hint (it's not Sun).

                        Unlike MS, Sun makes $$$ from selling hardware. Unlike
                        IBM, Sun doesn't/can't provide the whole solution to the
                        customer. For years Sun nerver gets the application
                        software right. Otherwise there won't be weblogic and
                        websphere. When the Sun management has no vision on how
                        to make money on application software(they are a
                        hardware vendor), what you can expect that they can get
                        the programming language right. Tim Bray is exceptional.
                        He would have done lots of good to Sun if he's joined in
                        1998. I love /usr/sbin/dtrace and /usr/sfw/bin/python.

                    >15 years ago they had an entire windowing system with a
                    built-in forth interpreter (NeWS) and let it die in favor of

                See
                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NeWS"
                    >the wikipedia entry</a
                >
                on possible reasons for the demise of NeWS. In short 1) X was
                established before NeWS, 2) NeWS required licensing from Sun,
                and 3) it practice it proved difficult to use.
