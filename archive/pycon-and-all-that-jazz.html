                Well, back from PyCon. It felt very busy... whether it was a
                BoF, or working on my presentation, or working on
                <a class="reference" href="http://formencode.org">FormEncode</a>
                so that I wasn't talking about vaporware... anyway, it was very

                Anyway, if I didn't have time or the leftover thoughtfulness to
                blog about it at the time, I'll try to write about some of the
                ideas after the fact.

            Lots of Python systems have tried hot-fix and resume. They don't
            work very well, though some may get close. Some of the problems are
            actually quite challenging regardless of environment -- you have to
            take each object and figure out a way to update it according to new
            specifications. So you either have to specifically specify how to
            upgrade each object (which is burdensome and is more code that can
            contain bugs, especially burdensome when you are just doing active
            development and have no valuable objects).
            <br />

            <br />
            In Smalltalk, sure, you can add another instance variable -- but
            they all end up as nil. That very well may be an impossible
            situation except when updating an old version of the instance
            variable. So how do you deal with that? Allow for the possibility of
            nil, even though that's a transient possibility? I'm sure there's
            tools or pattersn to deal with this, but it can't just be automatic
            in the general sense.

            CLOS - the object system of Common Lisp - solved these update
            problems quite early on. You have many ways to update instances on
            the fly when classes change. Sure, it's not fully automatic - it
            can't be fully automatic. But it is very easy to do. Erlang goes
            even further. Of course that's because of it's primary use that
            _needs_ hotfixing.

            Pause the processes that use the objects we wish to mutate, mutate
            the objects, initialize the changed fields, resume the processes.
            (The processes never see the "impossible situation".)

            Well, it's burdensome when you're only working on a development
            server, and/or you aren't performing any long-running computations.
            (Note that, in Webware, restarting the server doesn't cause any lost
            connections.) In a web environment, long-running computations aren't
            used that often, or if they are you might already have mechanisms to
            keep them running outside of the main server process. But yes, you
            have to consider how you'll restart the server safely.
            <br />

            <br />
            I can imagine it would be more of an issue if you were using objects
            that were persisted for a long time, and you wanted to upgrade those
            objects and maintain a list of "patches" that you could use to
            upgrade other objects when you deploy the software (though that's a
            challenging problem in itself). That's not generally a style that's
            used a lot in Webware, and probably not the style used anywhere
            where you don't have an object database.
            <br />

            <br />
            And if you have an object database... well, then you really do need
            to upgrade objects, and with considerable robustness and with a
            formalized process. But that quickly becomes a quite different
            discussion.

            <br />
            If it's acceptable to simply stop/start the process, then it's
            strange to describe it as a long-running process.

            Well, "long-running processes" makes sense in the domain that I am
            most familiar with -- daemons and servers -- which can usually be
            easily restarted, but are not restarted for every request (in
            contrast to CGI or inetd servers). But yes, you're right, it is
            confusing terminology, since it means different things depending on
            context.

            Somehow, all this reminds me of that famous "Worse is Better" paper.
