                in the latest Wired. To quote:
            </p>
            <blockquote>
                Green-minded activists failed to move the broader public not
                because they were wrong about the problems, but because the
                solutions they offered were unappealing to most people. They
                called for tightening belts and curbing appetites, turning down
                the thermostat and living lower on the food chain. They rejected
                technology, business, and prosperity in favor of returning to a
                simpler way of life. No wonder the movement got so little
                traction. Asking people in the world's wealthiest, most advanced
                societies to turn their backs on the very forces that drove such
                abundance is naive at best.

                <p>
                    The rise of worktime was unexpected. For nearly a hundred
                    years, hours had been declining. When this decline abruptly
                    ended in the late 1940s, it marked the beginning of a new
                    era in worktime.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Since 1948, the level of productivity of the U.S. worker has
                    more than doubled. In other words, we could now produce our
                    1948 standard of living (measured in terms of marketed goods
                    and services) in less than half the time it took in that
                    year. We actually could have chosen the four-hour day. Or a
                    working year of six months. Or, every worker in the United
                    States could now be taking every other year off from work --
                    with pay.
                </p>
                <p>
                    How did this happen? Why has leisure been such a conspicuous
                    casualty of prosperity?
                </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
                And I can't help but think the green-minded activists were right
                all along, and not just because of global warming. The
                product-driven society we're building is inane. And Wired is
                right there in the middle of it, obsessed with its stupid
                gadgetry. I am so, so, so tired of gadgets.
            </p>
            <p>
                But Wired isn't tired of gadgets, they just
                <em>love</em> consumerism, so they feel a need to criticize good
                people who are concerned with something other than the
                acquisition of status and wealth.
            </p>
            <p>
                But that's not really my point. My point is that the
                environmentalists are still mostly right, and the technologists
                are still mostly wrong. The environmentalists aren't
                <em>all</em> right -- sometimes they can be reactionary
                luddites, or suggest solutions that are unreasonable because
                they are predicated on population contraction or other
                impossibilities. But when they speak of conservation, frugality,
                and conscientious consumption, they are right. They believe we
                have a duty to give more back to the world than we take; you
                aren't <em>clever</em> when you trick the system and take more
                than you give: you are repugnant.
            </p>
            <p>
                What do the technologists offer? Tremendous <em>potential</em>,
                no doubt, and offers of real progress. But they are bound by
                this same economic force that the environmentalists wish they
                could escape. If you can't sell it, it isn't worth doing.
                Everything has to be <em>monitized</em>. Every transaction must
                be taxed, every benefit mitigated with a dollar cost, even if
                that cost is applied artificially... and if you can't monitize
                then it does not deserve attention.
            </p>
            <p>
                And of course this drives us to consumption, even as it damages
                both the planet and our personal lives. And how to solve it? The
                technologists answer: more consumption, always more
                consumption...
            </p>
            <p>
                The environmentalists were right then, and they are right now,
                and the consumerists are still wrong, and they've squandered too
                much of our technology and potential. There are many good things
                we've done in our modern society, and many things we've
                accomplished, but these have all been done for higher minded
                reasons than the acquisition of wealth.

            <div class="document">
                <p>
                    It seems to me that the Wired article is a combination of
                    the usual breathless Wired rhetoric with someone who either
                    has only just realised that environmentalism isn't about
                    1960s stereotypes, or that the best way to promote an agenda
                    is to needlessly and inaccurately trash other people to make
                    yourself look good. Of course, there are schools of thought
                    that claim that economics can do a sufficient job of
                    limiting mankind's impact on the environment; for example,
                    as weather gets more severe, this affects the insurance
                    business, which in turn affects anyone buying insurance,
                    which can affect any number of things. But it's debatable as
                    to whether the market can propagate the signals fast enough
                    and to the necessary places to make the right decisions
                    without governments stepping in and forcing people to change
                    their ways.
                </p>
                <p>
                    And I think there's another school of thought that
                    desperately clings on to the belief that we can enjoy a
                    luxurious lifestyle of overconsumption forever if only we
                    have the technology. That group doesn't seem to consider the
                    very special combination of circumstances that have produced
                    the late 20th century lifestyle: abundant stores of cheap
                    energy (burning millions of years of stored energy in an
                    instant), fortuitous control of disease using agents that
                    may prove to be unsustainable, amongst other things. The
                    problem is that if we do escape any disaster scenario, I
                    imagine that some of these people will believe that
                    environmental change was never a really serious threat,
                    whereas if things get really bad, no-one will be in any
                    doubt, but no-one will be able to do anything about it,
                    either.

                        I think this is actually a false choice. Or, at least,
                        implies a choice between personal satisfaction and
                        collective responsibility towards the environment. But I
                        think restraining consumption can increase personal
                        satisfaction, if we do it thoughtfully and not as slaves
                        of the market. In the US everyone has a car or SUV and
                        two televisions, but we also have a horrible healthcare
                        system that shows off every disfunction of market based
                        infrastructure. But we do nothing to fix that, because
                        we have no idea how -- the idea of doing anything that
                        isn't driven by the profit motive is beyond the
                        conception of our institutions.

                        What's interesting is that there have been proposals to
                        improve healthcare coverage which have been
                        market-oriented and which have fairly obvious economic
                        motivations: it's easier to prevent health problems
                        amongst the uninsured than to provide emergency
                        treatment later on. I can't see why, when both
                        compassionate <em>and</em> financial justifications
                        exist to improve healthcare coverage, that something
                        decisive isn't done, but I guess that says quite a lot
                        about the people dragging their feet on the matter.

                        Perhaps the most promising sources of "alternative"
                        energy can be brought online on a viable basis soon
                        enough to make energy something we never have to worry
                        about again, but there's the question of whether we'll
                        ever get a better shot than right now (or in the next
                        few decades) at achieving such things. It's much harder
                        to muster the effort for nuclear fusion research or for
                        things like a space programme in a society without
                        access to cheap and convenient energy.
