        <div class="document">
            <p>
                Well, I started
                <a class="reference" href="http://pythonpaste.org/djangopaste/"
                    >giving a run at DjangoPaste</a
                >. I was hoping it would be more straight-forward than CherryPy,
                but maybe it's actually a bit worse. Lots of things are global
                -- configuration is loaded and used on import, not at runtime.
                This is the hardest part of Pastifying an application/framework.
                Right now I only have an entry point for projects, when really I
                want to access individual applications, as I think Paste makes
                projects unnecessary. The only fundamentally complicated part of
                that is the admin screens, which are applications that know
                about other applications. I think that the admin application
                will have to be a middleware of sorts (composite app, in
                particular).
            </p>
            <p>
                But, even if Django might actually be a bit harder, the primary
                <a
                    class="reference"
                    href="http://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/1212"
                    >ticket that I opened</a
                >
                is already in the process of being fixed the morning after, so
                there's good momentum. And really I'm still very fuzzy about how
                well CherryPaste will work, because CherryPy isn't very
                expansive, and even if I can get the framework working that
                doesn't mean each application will work. So ultimately I'll
                really just be targetting TurboGears, as that's a set of
                applications that work similarly. Django involves things like
                database configuration up front, so if it works for one app then
                it is likely to work for all of them.
            </p>
            <p>
                Really this whole process of adapting projects to Paste started
                with a
                <a
                    class="reference"
                    href="http://projects.edgewall.com/trac/ticket/2581"
                    >patch to Trac</a
                >. That went really easily (even though there's more I'd like to
                do with it), and it made me
                <a
                    class="reference"
                    href="http://pythonpaste.org/archives/message/20060110.222846.3acb894c.en.html"
                    >feel optimistic</a
                >
                about this assimilation process. And that was based on the
                ability to monkeypatch and otherwise force compatibility
                separately from the original package. I always figured that
                would be transitional, that it would be good to bring that
                support into the original package directly, but I like the idea
                of not having to negotiate each conversion. Now I'm a little
                less optimistic about that. But we'll see how it goes.

                    We've already fixed one of the two tickets you opened, so
                    there's definitely interest in getting Django to work with
                    Paste. :)

                    Hugo's on the task, so the necessary tweaks to Django should
                    be available after not too long.

                    honestly I never understood what this pastifying was about
                    ... now it seems no other app can be easily
                    &quot;pastified&quot; ... I think there is a message in
                    there

                    I was curious about how difficult paste was to integrate
                    with twisted. I see on paste website is some support for it.

                        twisted.web2 has a WSGI server, so at that level it
                        should be workable. Twisted
                        <em>applications</em> generally aren't WSGI-compatible.
                        I have done a little work on making the Twisted server
                        usable in Paste, but never finished it.
