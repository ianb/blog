                When I cut a release for WSGIKit, I want the experience to be
                pretty easy -- you download the package, run a command, you got
                a server you can play with. It's pretty close to that right now,
                you can run:
            </p>
            <pre class="literal-block">
./server.py --webkit-dir=../examples/todo --server=wsgiutils \
    --reload -v -D
</pre
            >
            <p>
                To do that I have to ship some dependencies, like a server (<a
                    class="reference"
                    href="http://www.owlfish.com/software/wsgiutils/"
                    >WSGIUtils</a
                >
                is small, but now with
                <a
                    class="reference"
                    href="http://twistedmatrix.com/projects/web/"
                    >TwistedWeb</a
                >
                2 it's pretty reasonable as well). Maybe even a couple of
                servers. And if I want to make use of other people's middleware
                or libraries, I don't want to import them into my repository and
                namespace. I just want to distribute the files.
            </p>
            <p>
                One option is to use a zip file, which Python can import from.
                You just add the zip file to
                <tt class="docutils literal"
                    ><span class="pre">sys.path</span></tt
                >. For pure Python packages this works okay -- and if it's not
                pure Python it's not a simple install anyway and I don't mind
                leaving it out and forcing the user to install it on their own.
                There are some problems, however --
                <a
                    class="reference"
                    href="http://peak.telecommunity.com/DevCenter/PythonEggs"
                    >Eggs</a
                >
                try to solve this, but there's still a little work to do there.
            </p>
            <p>
                Then I realized I didn't really like zip files. Zip files nested
                in zip files, what does that buy? And anyway, I want users to
                have access to all the source unpacked, regardless of its origin
                -- this is the transparency we like in an open source framework.
                They shouldn't <em>need</em> to look at the source. But I
                actually <em>want</em> them to, since then they are more likely
                to contribute, and to generally feel comfortable with the
                infrastructure.
            </p>
            <p>
                So, my plan is to put all the external packages in a
                <tt class="docutils literal"
                    ><span class="pre">3rd-party</span></tt
                >
                directory. I named it so it's an invalid Python package, and
                people can't import from it directly. Instead for each package
                there's a subdirectory that is added if we need to load the
                package, so
                <tt class="docutils literal"
                    ><span class="pre">3rd-party/wsgiutils-files/</span></tt
                >
                is added to
                <tt class="docutils literal"
                    ><span class="pre">sys.path</span></tt
                >
                if
                <tt class="docutils literal"
                    ><span class="pre">wsgiutils</span></tt
                >
                can't be loaded the normal way. I'm 100% okay with adding 100K
                to the download to make the experience more pleasant -- heck,
                I'm probably okay with something much larger than 100K, it's
                only disk space and bandwidth, and both of those are cheap these
                days. I made a
                <a
                    class="reference"
                    href="http://svn.w4py.org/WSGIKit/trunk/wsgikit/util/thirdparty.py"
                    >little module</a
                >
                to support this -- no magic, nothing very fancy at all.

                    I would rather see a separate tarball labeled
                    <tt class="literal"
                        ><span class="pre">wsgikit-demo-A.B.C.tar.gz</span></tt

                    an application. If you were distributing a
                    fully-independant, batteries-included application for
                    Windows, then including all of the dependencies in a
                    convenience package might be worth it. However, as a
                    framework library, I would be disappointed to see cruft in
                    the tarball. It would simply take up mirror-space and
                    filesystem space for those that wish to create binary
                    packages of your library.

                <p>
                    There was recently a discussion on the gnu-prog list about
                    trying to formalize dependency requirements for applications
                    in the form of some XML or RFC-822 document in the top-level
                    directory of the tarball. Most of the ideas where shot down
                    over implementation details, duplication of effort
                    complaints, and unnecessarily making the build process too
                    complicated.

                <p>
                    Perhaps if you could leverage PyPI information regarding
                    package versions and locations, you could bootstrap the
                    retrieval and installation of the necessary software for
                    your demo; something you could optionally tie in to
                    <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">setup.py</span></tt
                    >.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Really, what it boils down to is that you need to
                    <strong>inform your user</strong> of the necessary
                    information rather than trying to hold his/her hand
                    throughout the process.

                        I want a pleasing immediate experience, so informing the
                        user isn't really what I'm looking to do. OTOH, it
                        probably makes sense to package two tarballs. Either way
                        the package includes just one

                        would only make a difference when you run the server out
                        of the unpacked directory.

                        OTOH, Twisted is looking pretty large -- 800K
                        compressed, to include twisted core, twisted.web, and
                        Zope interfaces. Which is disappointing. WSGIUtils and a
                        couple other servers are only a file, so it's easier.
