        <div class="document">
            <p>
                In my
                <a class="reference" href="my-python-4k.html">Python 4K</a> post
                I said:
            </p>
            <blockquote>
                I want nothing to do with any programmer who would mis-indent
                their code. If you want to mis-indent your code you are an
                idiot. If you want idiotic code to be an option you are being
                absurd.
            </blockquote>
            <p>
                This might come off as a little... well, not a friendly way of
                saying it. Maybe I'll expand a little:
            </p>
            <ul class="simple">
                <li>
                    We all know what &quot;correct&quot; indentation is. Really,
                    all of us, from every language.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Python enforces only correct indentation (though still with
                    a certain amount of flexibility). The only hitch is with
                    multi-line statements. Yet the newline as a statement
                    terminator doesn't seem controversial. Go figure.
                </li>
                <li>
                    So, Python is enforcing the bare minimum of style. By
                    &quot;bare minimum&quot; I mean that level of style that
                    even <em>you</em> will curse yourself for not using, and a
                    level of style that if you don't conform to will cause
                    revulsion for anyone else who sees your code.
                </li>
                <li>
                    It's not that hard to indent your code properly. Indenting
                    improperly is not a big time saver, even for one-off
                    scripts. Some people say &quot;one-off scripts usually
                    aren't&quot;. But you don't have to say that -- even for
                    really truly one-off scripts indenting is not hard.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Coming up with stories where it is better not to indent your
                    code properly is the &quot;absurd&quot; part. It's just not
                    worth it, and I honestly don't believe anyone rationally
                    argues otherwise.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Admittedly, people argue it irrationally. I think they feel
                    Python is being paternalistic, and they don't like that; it
                    invokes an emotional response. I think that is doubly
                    irrational, because there's all sorts of other things Python
                    requires that people don't worry about -- like case
                    sensitivity -- simply because programmers are already used
                    to those things. Why the concern over something even less
                    controversial than case issues?
                </li>
                <li>
                    Significant whitespace leads to very readable syntax errors.
                    (Newline terminators also do this, as does
                    <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">=</span></tt>
                    as a statement, and some other syntactic details.)
                </li>
                <li>
                    It really helps programming flow that most all syntax errors
                    in Python are trivial to detect (at least for an experienced
                    programmer -- but you don't have to be experienced in Python
                    to understand syntax errors quickly, you just have to be
                    experienced in any Algolish language).
                </li>
                <li>
                    Do you really have no memory of how obnoxious some other
                    languages can be about syntax errors? Like, really really
                    obnoxious? It's not worth it, especially when the syntax
                    errors are less helpful because of a complete non-feature
                    like insignificant whitespace.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                <strong>Update</strong>: I really messed something up and
                everyone who submitted comments had them sent into the void.
                What baffles me is that people then replied to the empty
                comments...? Anyway, sorry about that; fixed now.
