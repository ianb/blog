</div><h1>Naming Conventions</h1>
 <p>

One thing that's nice about Zope 3 is that they've been fairly
conscious about their <a href="http://dev.zope.org/Wikis/DevSite/Projects/ComponentArchitecture/CodingStyle">coding
standards</a>.  Being <a href="http://www.python.org/peps/pep-0008.html">PEP 8</a>  there's not
a lot of guidance for coding standards, and PEP 8 is vague on a number
of things.

<p>

For instance, they have some <a href="http://dev.zope.org/Wikis/DevSite/Projects/ComponentArchitecture/ZopePythonNamingConventions">naming
conventions</a>, with a combination I've never really seen before.
All public methods are named with mixed case, but local variables use
underscores.

<p>

However, they don't address how some other objects should be named,
for instance public objects.  A common case would be a registry
object; the class that implements the registry is never exposed
publically, and there's always just one instance of that class.  I
often name the class something like <tt>_Registry</tt> and the
instance <tt>Registry</tt>, but I think that may be confusing.  In
Smalltalk the convention is to use <tt>TheRegistry</tt>.  But the
class really <i>is</i> private, so a leading underscore is
appropriate; however, maybe <tt>The</tt> is good, because it makes it
clear you are dealing with an instance.  I don't know.

<p>

Anyway, the lack of consistency, or even a strong convention in Python
for these things is a bit annoying.  Or maybe it would be nice if
Python was like <a href="http://blog.colorstudy.com/ianb/weblog/2004/01/26.html#P58">XL</a>
and was neutral on the whole matter.

 I like your idea of naming the class _Registry and the instance Registry. I don't think it's confusing at all, and the underscore signals your intent nicely.
