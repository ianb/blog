        <h1>Javascript Convert...?</h1>
        <p>
            I never like Javascript. Still don't. But I still find myself drawn
            to DHTML in interfaces. It's more responsive, and frequently a lot
            easier to implement (even if I'm still a Javascript novice).
        </p>

        <p>
            Most recently I used
            <a href="http://www.kryogenix.org/code/browser/sorttable/"
                >sorttable</a
            >
            in a project. It was far easier to implement than a server-side
            sorting, especially if you want to sort orthogonally from search
            terms or other selectors, or handle multiple sortable tables in the
            same page. And it gives a better user experience to boot. I'm not
            sure about the browser compatibility, but the application already
            has high browser requirements (since it include a WYSIWYG editor) so
            I'm not too concerned.
        </p>

        <p>
            Since I'm still a server-side programmer, I made a few extensions to
            make it easier to customize. You can add a
            <tt>sortval</tt> attribute to a table cell, which will be used for
            sorting instead of the contents of the cell, and a
            <tt>sortsuppress="1"</tt> attribute to column headers to suppress
            sorting on that cell. This way I can use nicely-formatted dates like
            "Yesterday, 8:42am" in my cells, but put the timestamp in the
            <tt>sortval</tt> attribute to sort on. The modified code is
            <a href="https://ianbicking.org/software/sorttable-ib.js">here</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
            I'm very pleased with the result. Cheers to Stuart Langridge for a
            nice bit of code. (His
            <a href="http://www.kryogenix.org/code/browser/aqlists/"
                >expandable tree</a
            >
            code was also helpful)
        </p>
