            Well, we all know why November 2 was so disappointing. Or, at least
            you know why it was disappointing to me and so many others. But,
            after moping around for a couple days, here's my attempt at
            positivity.
        </p>

        <p>
            One lesson from the election: facts and policy and reason don't mean
            anything. The
            <a href="http://mondediplo.com/2004/10/02usa"
                >demographics which voted for Bush</a
            >
            didn't particularly benefit from Bush's policies. They tended to be
            <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/zestyping/80949.html"
                >misinformed about the world around them</a
            >. But it's not like they didn't have the opportunity to be
            informed, so just providing more information isn't going to change
            this.
        </p>

        <p>
            What's the upside? Well, if it's not about facts and policy,
            suddenly we're freed up a bit more. There's been this race to the
            center - thinking if we can just cut even closer down the center,
            then somehow the majority will end up on the Democratic side. Bush
            is obviously a counter argument, as he's far to the right. But more
            generally, when facts and policy don't matter, there's nothing to be
            won in the center. (Of course, a linear left/right is a convenient
            simplification in itself, but that's a separate topic.)
        </p>

        <p>
            So maybe, instead of trying to slow the tide of conservatism, people
            will have the guts to move in a more progressive, not just
            reactionary direction. That won't solve anything, but it won't hurt
            either. Enough of Clinton's Third Way. (And on the topic of Third
            Way - we failed in the US, Australians failed to dump Howard, at
            least can you Brits get rid of Blair already? Can we get just a
            <i>little</i>
            <a href="http://mesozoic.geecs.org/cogito/archives/000096.html"
                >accountability</a
            >
            somewhere?)
        </p>

        <p>
            We need to find a new direction in the culture war. Cool
            <a
                href="http://blog.colorstudy.com/ianb/weblog/2004/10/29.html#P169"
                >won't do it</a
            >; it's too exclusive, it's already alienated many people, and
            alienation is part of the <i>essence</i> of cool. It can't just be
            about Hollywood. Apparently <i>Will and Grace</i> hasn't made
            America much more tolerant. Can we find something else? Maybe a
            distrust and even hatred of corporations? There's a wealth of
            <a
                href="http://archive.salon.com/comics/boll/2000/06/29/boll/story.gif"
                >cultural material</a
            >
            there. Or maybe there's something else.
        </p>

        <p>
            Christianity has its own role in all this. That's disappointing.
            Jesus wouldn't have been happy with Bush. Still, there's some
            <a
                href="http://www.sojo.net/index.cfm?action=action.election&item=confession_signers"
                >real potential</a
            >
            there as well. There's too many ministers who take after Cotton
            Mather, and not enough that take after Martin Luther King. More
            attention to
            <a href="http://www.cjd.org/paper/jp2war.html">this</a>, and a hell
            of a lot less of

                >this</a
            >.
        </p>

        <p>
            I'll probably stop posting much about this soon; not that I feel bad
            about posting, but I feel a need to withdraw from news some. News
            serves little purpose. But I'll be looking out for good ideas.

            Good start, you didn't call your opponents "enemies" (too much enemy
            talk around these days).
            <br />
            You won't believe it, but the uninformed voter study was a setup.
            The common wisdom is that less than 10% of people are news & policy
            junkies. Everyone else knows about the one or two issues that matter
            to them most. So if you don't know and someone asks you if
            Kerry/Bush (who you think well of) supports a treaty (treaties sound
            like good things) you answer yes. If you ask about treaties that
            Kerry supports but Bush doesn't you get the result in the study (all
            ignorant voters say yes, but only the Kerry ones are correct). Some
            control questions about real sounding but made up events would go a
            long way to measuring that kind of error. More questions that
            ignorant Kerry voters would guess wrongly on wouldn't hurt either.
            <br />

            <br />
            You make a mistake that pro-Bush people don't believe in issues.
            That they don't have a "hatred of corporations" might strike you as
            absurd but you can't conclude from that they have no opinions. They
            just don't share yours. You seem to think that <i>because</i> they
            share none of your opinions they must not have thought about
            anything at all. Looking down on those voters isn't going to pick
            you up any votes in the next election. The zoo mentality ("let's go
            to the foreign land called Alabama and observe the natives") comes
            off as pandering or condecension, not understanding.
            <br />

            <br />
            I do hope the Democrats get their stuff together (I think they will,
            because they have to). The worst thing that could happen is that the
            leftmost part of the party seizes power and the Republicans have an
            even bigger lock on power for the next ten years. Whenever that
            happens (with either party) you get incumbent politicians that just
            do whatever they like (spending my money to do it) without fear of
            losing their seat. The Republicans hit their nadir with Goldwater
            and it took 40 years for the pendulum to swing the other way. (The
            "Goldwater Moment" is now looked on fondly as the point Repubs woke
            up and got their collective stuff together, but if I was alive then
            I don't think I'd be happy with taking a beating and having to spend
            20 years building infrastructure).

            If the planet has not blown up in 4 years, maybe we'll FINALLY
            figure out how evil corporations are, how much of our civil
            liberties have been lost in the name of security, and how
            ridiculous, pompous, and arrogant we seem to the rest of the world.
            <br />

            <br />
            Maybe we'll figure it out, but I doubt it.

            Jack: I'm not going to respect the Bush supporters' world view. I
            could go into why, I could go to great length to talk about why they
            are misinformed and are unintentionally voting against their
            beliefs, but it's kind of a moot point. Those people are not my
            enemies (though the Republican insiders <i>are</i>), and I don't
            think they are stupid, but they are being manipulated, and they bare
            some of the blame for that. And anyway, I'm not a public figure, so
            it doesn't matter if I pander or condescend, I'm not a figurehead,
            I'm not even a decision maker, and if these ideas mean anything it's
            only because they spark some interest among like-minded people. I
            don't have to be polite to the opposition, there's no real point to
            it.
            <br />

            <br />
            As far as the anti-corporate sentiment... well, that's an area where
            there's potential, an untapped belief system that I sense in our
            society, but it has few outlets. And certainly no outlets that are
            accessible to Red State Americans; I don't expect these people to
            become anarchists and live in collectives and protest WTO meetings.
            But I think the sentiment is there, but with few groups willing to
            tap it. The Democrats aren't going to do it, at least not as they
            are now. But it could still happen, and it could be powerful. For
            all the people who value humans above institutions, it could be very
            powerful.

            <br />
            Just not going to happen I'm afraid - there's no credible
            opposition! The conservatives are a lousy option, and the liberal
            democrats are too small to get a large enough swing to win an
            election. The best we can hope for is that the liberal democrats
            overtake the conservatives as the second largest party and start
            putting on a decent opposition.

            Ian,
            <br />
            I agree with your statement that Jesus wouldn't have been happy with
            Bush. He has done many things against the teachings of Christ.
            Still, he was pro-life and he did something about it (partial birth
            abortion bill) and so he got my vote. These elections usually are a
            vote for the lesser of two evils (with each person voting according
            to their own conscience).
            <br />

            <br />
            However, I think ministers would set their sites too low if they
            were to set their goals on emulating Martin Luther King. He was a
            great man and is to be honored for his message of peace and the work
            he did. But better yet, why not
            <a href="http://www.luther.de/en/" target="_blank">Martin Luther</a
            >? I can think of few better people to emulate in we're to make a
            better tomorrow. Neither a Democrat or a Republican, and a very well
            educated man, as I hear. Wouldn't you agree?

            You aren't going to get anywhere so long as you claim that Bush's

            James: I'm not a diplomat. The election is over, there is no point

            opponents think, and they are wrong, but I don't expect explanations
            to matter. People determine their axiomatic beliefs, then they look
            for supporting evidence. The right has framed the discussion so that
            axiomatic beliefs are aligned with their own, focusing on the small
            overlaps they can find.

            Ian,
            <br />
            They have gone up, you're right. America is still composed of people
            who are agents of free will and abortion is still legal. However,
            when abortion is illegal, they will go down.
            <br />

            <br />
            Now, making abortion illegal only treats the symptom, albeit a very
            devestating one, and not the root cause of the problem. Abortion is
            just a symptom of the real problems - selfishness and
            irresponsibility. How to change that? Well, that kind of change a
            person can only experience by placing one's faith in Jesus Christ as
            savior. And that experience can only be through free will. It cannot
            - <b>it must not</b> be forced upon anyone. Well, it just can't be
            forced on anyone, just won't work.

            So, Bush can only accomplish so much in the realm of the unborn, but
            I'm confident he's the best (only?) candidate for legislative reform
            where abortion is concerned.

            <br />
            Do you disagree on that point?

            A serious question to Perry:
            <br />

            <br />
            As a pro-life supporter, are you willing to bear the cost of
            childcare and health insurance for some large portion of the ~1.3
            million new children that will be born every year as a result of
            making abortions illegal? Is there a way to work out a system that
            allows me to not bear that cost?
            <br />

            <br />
            Just trying to understand.

            Bush isn't going to make abortion illegal, he'll just keep the legal
            harrassment up. He's just a flirt, he wants your vote, but he can't
            do anything very substantive. If you want to decrease the number of
            abortions, you either have to improve birth control, or change our
            culture. Good luck on the culture thing.
            <br />

            <br />
            Bush <i>has</i> been bad at improving birth control. His
            abstinence-based programs, for one: they don't increase abstinence,
            and actively lie to youth about basic sex education (for instance,
            slandering the effectiveness of condoms). The people behind these
            programs are just plain liars. I'm sure they think they are doing
            the right thing, that it's better to lie to youth to scare them
            straight. I disagree with that on principle, but from a practical
            point of view it has also failed.

            So, someone votes for Bush because he is against abortions, but he
            is also the one who made a war against Iraq and killed a lot of
            people and a lot of kids. I think I am pro-life in being against
            wars not abortion.
            <br />
            But maybe the war was better than the embargo with had already
            killed a lot of children because they couldn't get medicine and
            food.
