                on car-use in Manhattan.
            </p>
            <p>
                The basic conclusions are that low-volume passenger cars are
                taking up space and causing traffic problems, while having low
                value to the area. I.e., people aren't providing business or an
                economic incentive, they could use mass transit, and they are
                getting in the way of high-value traffic like deliveries and
                high-capacity passenger vehicles like buses.
            </p>
            <p>
                The response to things like this is often to punish low-volume
                passenger vehicles. Some of these options are implemented in a
                very dumb way. For instance, encouraging medium-volume passenger
                vehicles with special lanes for vehicles with more than one
                passenger. Usually the poor delivery trucks get stuck with the
                rest of the traffic. Or parking is constrained and/or expensive.
                Or there's a toll for all vehicles entering the central business
                district, like in London.
            </p>
            <p>
                Not surprisingly, it doesn't make people happy to be punished.
                It's also a really lame response. If people are using cars
                instead of other options, then why?
            </p>
            <p>
                I think it is because mass transit sucks. It sucks a lot.
                Horribly. There's sometimes a perception problem, sometimes an
                intimidation factor, but mostly it's just that mass transit is
                awful.
            </p>
            <p>
                I say this as a person who uses public transportation and
                actively dislikes cars. But that doesn't blind me to the real
                disadvantages of our current options.

                        The incremental cost of a car trip is low compared to
                        mass transit. In Chicago it now costs $4 to make a round
                        trip ($4.50 if you transfer). Per person, regardless of
                        distance. For many people even the total operational
                        cost of a car is likely to be lower. For a family
                        traveling together the price can be rather absurd (even
                        if children get discounted fairs -- discounts which are
                        not well facilitated as systems are automated).

                        If transit isn't a complete solution -- i.e., people
                        can't actually get rid of their cars -- then only the
                        incremental cost matters.

                        Transit generally fails in several situations. No late
                        night service. Poor service to certain areas, even
                        inside the city. Difficult to use for things like
                        grocery shopping. Not much consideration of the
                        importance of car and trunk rentals as a complementary
                        service. (Generally, no consideration <em>at all</em> of
                        the changes in and needs of a community.)

                    <p class="first">
                        It typically takes 2-4x longer to get somewhere on mass
                        transit. This is door-to-door time;
                        <em>sometimes</em> mass transit can be faster for the
                        portion of the trip where it applies. But usually it is
                        much slower. When you add wait times and time to walk to
                        your actual destination, it's almost always slower. Even
                        commuter rail, which is one of the most effective kinds
                        of mass transit, doesn't do that well here.

                        Mass transit seldom goes where you want it to. Chicago
                        buses actually do really well because of the grid system
                        -- it's two bus rides to get just about anywhere, and
                        you can predict exactly what those bus rides are. The El
                        sucks; it is optimized only for people going to and from
                        downtown. In most cities there are large portions of the
                        city that are either not served at all, or only have
                        service going to one location (with transfers for other
                        destinations).

                        Service that stops closer to where you want also makes
                        it slower to get there. More stops means nearby service.
                        More stops means stopping for other people's stops, and
                        thus slower service.

                        Many forms of mass transit are not energy efficient.
                        Light Rail frequently uses more BTUs than a car ride
                        (depends on ridership). Heavy Rail (conventional subway
                        systems, which is ironically usually lighter than Light
                        Rail) fairs a little better, but not substantially
                        better than cars. Buses do okay, commuter rail is
                        excellent. If you factored in the overhead of electrical
                        distribution (which I understand is substantial) I
                        expect mass transit would do even worse.

                    <p>
                        To be fair, this doesn't keep anyone off mass transit.
                        But it is fair to tax the environmentally detrimental
                        aspects of cars. But -- excluding smog and other
                        localized environmental factors -- cars aren't that bad
                        compared to current alternatives.

                        Maintenance and capital costs for these systems are
                        insane. Only buses do okay. Trains have staggering
                        capital costs. Significant maintenance on even a small
                        section can require shutting down the entire line.
                        Avoiding shutdowns requires slow and meticulous
                        maintenance processes that are expensive, and
                        discourages upgrades.

                        Buses aren't that nice of an experience. Unpredictable
                        schedules. Generally uncomfortable, and they don't
                        really free up time -- you can listen to the radio in
                        your car just as well as in the bus, and you can't do
                        much more than that in a bus. Except when given special
                        lanes buses always travel slower than cars.

                There are incremental ways to improve things, without using a
                stick approach:
            </p>
            <ul class="simple">
                <li>Longer lights and other traffic designs for buses</li>
                <li>
                    I think bus drivers should get a little more aggressive too;
                    though when riding a bike buses doubly scare me
                </li>
                <li>
                    Faster systems -- the El is old and slow; other systems are
                    faster (still seldom as fast as cars, even in traffic)
                </li>
                <li>
                    Decrease headways (why Chicago is putting huge amounts of
                    money into extending the length of all the train stations
                    instead of just running trains more often I cannot fathom)
                </li>
                <li>
                    Lower fares dramatically -- they don't even cover
                    operational costs anyway
                </li>
                <li>
                    Free for children -- in addition to being family friendly
                    (current transit systems are actively unfriendly to
                    families) this will get people comfortable with the transit
                    system at a young age
                </li>
                <li>
                    Systems like
                    <a class="reference" href="http://www.igocars.org/">I-GO</a>
                    provide an interesting complementary car service; I'm sure
                    it's heavily subsidized, but the result seems surprisingly
                    affordable
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Still, I'm not optimistic. The basic structure of mass transit
                is ineffective. It feels like the mainframe of transportation
                systems. Toss a bunch of people together and into a batched
                process, ignoring latency while optimizing for bandwidth and
                forcing people to adapt to the system instead of adapting the
                system to the people. The result is slow and uncomfortable. It
                also scales in only one way: it handles large number of people
                coming and going from the same location at the same time of day.
                So long as the number of people remains within capacity. Once
                you go over capacity the system starts to collapse. If people
                have a wider variety of start and end points, if they are
                traveling different distances, if they are traveling in
                different densities at a variety of times it doesn't work. As
                <em>mass</em> transit it <em>never will</em> work.
            </p>
            <p>
                Cars scale pretty well. The door-to-door experience is well
                thought out. The result is an extremely ugly community (parking
                lots and traffic lights everywhere), but the transportation
                portion works. Though there are scaling problems as you move
                from free-flowing highway traffic to regulated local traffic,
                the service provided is complete. Traffic and parking is a
                problem these days, but car-based transit has improved
                continuously and dramatically in the last 100 years, in response
                to demand. We're seeing diminished returns and reaching the
                scaling limits, but we shouldn't discount what's been
                accomplished so far. Mass transit has only improved in very
                small ways. Cars-based transit is like packet-based networking;
                we know how superior that model is for internet traffic, and the
                benefits of that model are just as relevant for transit as for
                internet traffic.
            </p>
            <p>
                All this is my long-winded way of getting to my real point, the
                thing I actually feel optimistic about: we need dramatically
                different <em>public</em> transit that is not
                <em>mass</em> transit. We need to revolutionize public transit.
                We can't put up with these horrible systems we have today. It
                isn't honest to push these systems as though they are something
                they are not. It isn't honest to encourage communities to invest
                many billions of dollars in systems that we <em>know</em> don't
                work.
            </p>
            <p>
                People often say &quot;we need a good transit system like in New
                York or Chicago&quot;. I don't know the NYC transit system well,
                but I can say without a doubt that
                <strong>Chicago mass transit sucks</strong>. The traffic sucks
                too, as does parking, so the mass transit is
                <em>relatively less sucky</em> than elsewhere. But it still
                sucks. Please don't use us as a model.
            </p>
            <p>
                I've already gone on for too long, but I will say that I am
                thoroughly convinced that what we need is
                <a class="reference" href="http://cprt.org/"
                    >Personal Rapid Transit (PRT)</a
                >. PRT is an automated rail-based system with small cars
                (typically 1-3 passengers). Service is direct, and stops are
                made offline -- when one car stops it doesn't hold anyone else
                up. The systems are as small and light as possible. No 20-ton
                vehicles to carry around at most one ton of passengers. The
                systems won't be built in spoke-like systems with hubs as
                transfer points; instead they use a series of intersecting loops
                that provide coverage without centralization. Redundancy is
                built in. New systems can come online incrementally, and every
                addition expands the overall capacity. It looks a lot like the
                internet.
            </p>
            <p>
                The result has the potential to provide better service than cars
                for most cases (you still can't go camping via PRT). The capital
                costs are lower than any other rail-based transit, and compare
                well against roads. Service is provided faster and more
                comfortably than a bus. Because the system is made as light as
                possible it is feasible to have lots of stations, giving good
                coverage. Because of the ease of expansion and adding
                connections, it can work well with other kinds of transit, and
                adapt to the community.
            </p>
            <p>
                The technology is not mature, but this is a <em>benefit</em>.
                Traditional mass transit is mature, and thus we can't expect
                them to get substantially better anytime soon (automobiles are
                also a very mature technology, and we're seeing only very modest
                advances.)
            </p>
            <p>
                We know how traditional transit works, and we know it works
                poorly. With PRT we have a system with
                <em>future potential</em>. Despite the fact that PRT is an idea
                that has languished for years, it is an idea that is
                <em>so cool</em> I can't help but feel excited just thinking
                about the positive effects it could have on a community. And the
                crazy thing is that it is not even very high tech, and even the
                most conservative claims of its potential are revolutionary.

                        I certainly have no love for cars, and appreciate
                        there's a lot of hidden costs, and that those costs
                        should be born by the people using cars. But I also
                        think many anti-car people are using the car subsidy as
                        an unwarranted excuse for the failures of mass transit.
                        People won't use mass transit, and they hope through
                        ever increasing punishment they can get them to use mass
                        transit, even as the mass transit systems stagnate or
                        even decline in utility. The next system should be
                        better than the last, it shouldn't just rely on a
                        collapse of the last system.

                <p>Nicely done. Let me add my 2c:</p>
                <ol class="arabic simple">
                    <li>
                        Mass transit works well only in densely populated areas.
                        It is a simple fact of life. Basically your trip consist
                        of 3 components:
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <blockquote>
                    <ol class="loweralpha simple">
                        <li>the trip to the departure station</li>
                        <li>the trip itself on a mass transportation system</li>
                        <li>the trip from the arrival station.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>
                        Let's assume that the tolerable trip to/from a station
                        is 15 minutes. If you walk, it means that it is
                        approximately 1 mile long. Now imagine a 1-mile sphere
                        around your station. This is a service zone. You better
                        have a lot of people living/working/visiting here. You
                        need skyscrapers to utilize this volume efficiently.
                        Some underground facilities (like underground malls)
                        will be helpful too. How many U.S. cities fit the
                        picture? New York --- yes, Los Angeles --- yes, Chicago
                        --- probably, Houston --- unlikely, and so on (I covered
                        the top 4 most populous cities). My point is: a mass
                        transit system will be unprofitable in almost all
                        American cities or it would be inconvenient to use.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A case in point: it takes me &gt;15 minutes to drive to
                        the nearest DART station, which will take me to the
                        downtown. It takes me 20-25 minutes to drive to the
                        downtown in my car. Could you guess what I do? My DART
                        line goes along 75, which has a speed limit of 60 MPH.
                        DART cannot exceed 45 MPH and stops frequently. It takes
                        more than 20 minutes to get to the downtown using DART.
                        Like everybody else I pay my taxes to support DART (1%
                        of all sales goes there) and like majority of locals I
                        cannot use it.

                        Any mass transit system sucks, if you need to travel
                        with bags, packages, and stuff in general. Try to go
                        shopping and bring back what you bought. Try to visit
                        several stores during one trip. No matter what you do it
                        is inconvenient.

                    <li>
                        Mass transit is convenient, if the only thing you need
                        is to haul yourself. If your commute to work takes
                        &gt;20 minutes, there are many things you can do to
                        spend this time productively rather than being alert
                        driving: reading, answering e-mails, working on laptop,
                        and so on.

                    <li>
                        There is one good alternative to a mass transit: a
                        telecommute --- the most economical and efficient form
                        of transportation. :-) As far as I can tell there are
                        many lines of work, where it is appropriate and
                        acceptable.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        A lot of public transportation advocates use European
                        countries as an example. Usually they forget to mention
                        that their price of gas is roughly twice higher than in
                        U.S.A. because of excise taxes, which were designed to
                        help European economy after WWII. ;-) It is one more
                        example of punishment you mentioned.

                    I <em>love</em> the idea of PRT, but I have to agree with
                    Eugene that there's not a lot of cities where it could cover
                    its running and maintenance costs over more than a small
                    area. Here in Sydney, Australia, a gigantic problem would be
                    purchasing the real-estate for the stations and tracks.

                    Also, a nit: as nice as a complimentary car service would
                    be, it's more accurate to describe I-GO as a
                    &quot;complementary&quot; service.

                        A PRT rail line is only supposed to take up one lane,
                        and could be put into a parking lane, so the real estate
                        is fairly limited. It's also compatible with other
                        traffic, unlike LRT or some other systems. Elevated
                        heavy rail is much harder, because they are so heavy; as
                        a result no one seems to be building them anymore. Those
                        take up a lot of real estate, probably the biggest cost
                        for doing any expansion (especially a dense city); going
                        underground of course has its own very high costs.

                    I believe that PRT will be what cities will be using in the
                    future. The &quot;future&quot; being 50-100 years. If you
                    look at the numbers (cost per mile, capital costs, etc.), it
                    just makes far too much sense. The reason PRT hasn't been
                    done is that PRT hasn't been done: the transportation
                    industry is incredibly conservative and awash with monied
                    interests (at least in the US). All it will take is one
                    success, and it should take off.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Look at it this way. If an average city put in a single PRT
                    loop through the middle part of the city, and maybe a run
                    out to an airport, do you think a shopping maul might be
                    willing to through a few million to be added to the loop?
                    How about an apartment complex? It scales the same way the
                    Internet did.

                <p>
                    Now, jumping to python here, if we want to help make this
                    happen, the way to do it is to create a simulator where all
                    someone has to do is put in a 3d view of a city and a track
                    pattern, and then they should be able to virtually ride the
                    new system. Multiple CPUs may be required :-). I seem to
                    recall that google was doing a 3d capture of San Francisco a
                    while back. I'm not sure how far that's gotten.

                        looking to move out of defense (peace surplus, hah,
                        remember those days?), and they were foisting decisions

                    Longer trains vs. more frequent trains is usually a result
                    of old signalling systems that can't cope with higher
                    frequency. I know this is the case here in Melbourne.

                    Well you've almost got it. I'd make a few changes. First,
                    I'd do away with the rail and make the cars drive themselves
                    on the existing roads. This gets rid if the big
                    infrastructure building problem and makes the trip door to
                    door. Sure cars can't drive themselves yet but they're
                    getting there. They don't have to be perfect - just better
                    than a human being. That's a pretty low standard to meet if
                    you ask me.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Second, get rid of the fixed routes. When you need a ride,
                    you punch a button on your GPS enabled cell phone and tell
                    it where you want to go. A big server farm puts that data
                    into the system and then matches you up with an existing car
                    that's going to the same general area as you and that also
                    has space available. Your ride gets selected out of the
                    existing cloud of vehicles currently on the road.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You could do this now by using drivers until the self driven
                    vehicles become available. To scale the system for rush
                    hour, you let people use their existing cars in a dynamic
                    carpool. They're instructed by the same cell phone on who to
                    pick up on the way to and from work. For off ours, you keep
                    a certain number of vehicles availble. You'd loose money on
                    the off ours but it would be worth it because the system
                    works best if you can eliminate the personal vehicles.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Cars cost a fortune. By using the existing infrastructure
                    and eliminating the need for a personal car, you should be
                    able to move more people much more cheaply than any existing
                    system. The only problem would be writting the software that
                    matches people up to the best car for their trip.

                        That's very much like the rail option, except at-grade.
                        This works okay as long as the system is closed. That
                        is, <em>people</em> are not allowed in the system. Being
                        better than humans at working with humans is a nearly
                        AI-complete problem. Judging, for instance, the
                        intention of a biker or pedestrian at a crosswalk
                        requires a subtle reading of body language. So, get rid
                        of the humans and you are all set.

                    <p>
                        Of course, this kind of environment is being set up in
                        many communities. Many suburbs are already
                        human-hostile, with more and more &quot;order&quot;
                        being imposed with special lanes, traffic signals, etc.
                        But it doesn't appeal to me very much. The technology
                        for that kind of automation is crazy hard.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A more modest -- but still far from implemented -- goal
                        is cars that are automated on the highway. In this model
                        you have a closed system -- special highway lanes --
                        that cars can reliably work in. The infrastructure costs
                        are lower because it isn't a complete system, and relies
                        on drivers for much of the driving (everywhere except
                        the highway). It's incremental to a degree, because not
                        everyone has to use those lanes, though the people that
                        do will have to replace or upgrade their cars. There is
                        an efficiency because the lanes are much higher
                        capacity. In theory I think there is some energy saving,
                        because cars might actually travel close enough together
                        to decrease drag; though I'm not sure if that's actually
                        significant. In some proposals the cars go quite fast
                        (e.g., 80 or 90mph) which means significantly reduced
                        mileage. One of PRT's potential advantages is not the
                        raw speed (though some systems are designed for high
                        speeds), but running at a consistent and efficient
                        speed. This is good for efficiency. The
                        low-hanging-fruit of energy efficiency vs. speed is to
                        increase (or at least retain) average speed, while
                        decreasing maximum speed. Automated car systems
                        typically only increase maximum speed to increase
                        average speed.

                            Reading my own reply, I wonder how I kept typing

                            Like I mentioned, you could use drivers until the
                            vehicles could drive themselves. I pictured a system
                            where independent drivers would purchase their own
                            vehicle and join the driver network. They wouldn't
                            have set routes but would get directed by the cell
                            phone or other GPS enabled device to where they pick
                            up and drop off passengers. The driver network would
                            take care of all the billing. Individuals who work
                            other jobs could join the driver network during rush
                            hour to help pay their personal vehicle expenses.
                            Drivers working at night when there's less demand
                            would get paid more per passenger. Even though the
                            network would loose money at night, it could make it
                            up during the day but service would be available
                            24x7.

                        <p>
                            With the cell phones networked together with
                            built-in GPS, the hardware is in place to do this
                            now. The software to track that many vehicles and
                            match up the passenger with the best car is the
                            difficult part. I don't even know if it's possible
                            but it would be interesting to build some sort of
                            simulation just to get a feel about how hard it
                            would be. I've wanted to work on it for a long time
                            but I'm too busy and I'm really not bright enough to
                            do that kind of work.

                            If you did get it working, the other problem would
                            be getting people to use it. By nature, it works
                            better with the highest volumes. If you've got
                            10,000 cars hooked up to the network, the chances of
                            you finding a ride going the same route as you is a
                            lot better than if you only have 500 cars. At
                            100,000 cars, you probably wouldn't have to wait
                            long for a car and the car wouldn't have to make
                            very many stops. To get higher participation, you
                            have the government subsidize it for a while.
                            Companies that offer carpool incentives could use
                            that to encourage people.

                            it working. It could revolutionize transportation
                            worldwide. Like you said, current mass transit
                            doesn't work very well. Here in Phoenix Arizona,
                            we're too spread out for any traditional mass
                            transit to work. Here, you need a car.

                                of the micro bus lines common in the developing

                                Microbuses, driving on kind of ad hoc routes and
                                picking people up. They don't take you to your
                                exact destination, and there's no high-tech way
                                to manage or get a pick up, but they are
                                definitely a more decentralized kind of bus.

                                transportation. How buses can run at a profit

                                understand. But for the most part they really do

                                maintenance is much less... thorough. And they
                                drive fast. And they use old vehicles -- less
                                capital costs. Still, kind of crazy they can
                                make it work and profit. That said, here in the
                                non-developing world taxis are expensive. They
                                are actually taxed, not subsidized, and they
                                don't pick people up in the same way, and they
                                have higher capital costs. But I worry that
                                there are basic economics that make them
                                unpractical. Drivers and mechanics are paid more
                                here. People expect a nicer riding experience.
                                But maybe it isn't impossible, if done right and
                                smart.

                                    Yeah. I guess people would have a hard time
                                    paying the actual cost but that's more of a
                                    perception problem. The system would have to
                                    be cheaper than owning your own car. People
                                    are paying the cost now it's just hidden in
                                    their existing budgets.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    As a little exercise, I tried to figure out
                                    about what my current per-trip cost is for
                                    my 2001 Tundra pickup. It cost 18,000 so
                                    lets assume I can drive it for ten years so
                                    the yearly cost is about $1,800. During that
                                    time, I'll figure that regular maintenance
                                    will average $500 per year. I drive around
                                    16,224 miles a year making six 52 mile round
                                    trips a week. I get about 18 miles per
                                    gallon so my yearly gas bill should be
                                    around $2000. I also pay about $1,200 in
                                    insurance. That comes out to a total of
                                    $5,500. I'm figuring on 312 commutes to work
                                    a year so every single time I drive to work
                                    and back it costs me about $17.62. I
                                    probably wouldn't pay $3 for a one way bus
                                    ride but I'll pay much more than that to
                                    drive without even knowing I'm doing it.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    That's part of the political problem. You
                                    can create a system that's much more
                                    efficient because you increase the ride
                                    density. Put an average of four people in
                                    that car without adding too many miles to
                                    the trip and you greatly decrease the
                                    per-person cost. There are billions of
                                    dollars in potential savings! Plus, if you
                                    can get enough people using it, it decreases
                                    traffic which increases both fuel and time
                                    efficiency. In many places, it would speed
                                    up commute times because even though you're
                                    making more stops, you wouldn't be stuck in
                                    traffic.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Bootstrapping the system would be the hard
                                    part. If you can't get enough people to use
                                    it, it wouldn't work. The wait times would
                                    be too long. I have my doubts about whether
                                    you could ever get it up and running but if
                                    you could, it would be the only mass transit
                                    system that would work out here in the west.

                                    In Russia (at least when I visited in
                                    1995-96) there are &quot;routed taxis&quot;
                                    (marskrutnaya taksi) and &quot;taxis&quot;.
                                    The routed taxis are vans and just take you
                                    to the nearest metro station. They fill the
                                    gaps in the streetcar/trolleybus/autobus
                                    network in the outer parts of the city.

                                <p>
                                    The &quot;taxis&quot; are private cars,
                                    driven by people who need money or are just
                                    bored, so they drive around all night giving
                                    people lifts for maybe $3 a trip. People who
                                    don't want to be seen taking public
                                    transportation take &quot;taxis&quot;
                                    instead, and everybody uses them in the
                                    off-hours. You just hold out your hand
                                    (straight out, not thumb up) at the passing
                                    cars until one stops, and then negotiate a
                                    fare. I had friends who drove them
                                    occasionally. I wondered if they were safe
                                    but I never heard of anybody getting robbed
                                    in one.

                    I saw The Oil Drum article too -- quite interesting. I agree
                    with you, mostly, and have been hoping PRT gets taken
                    seriously. I do, however, have a couple of notes. (1)
                    Chicago is not a good transit model, but Portland is. (2)
                    Urban planning has to be holistic.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Chicago is not a model of efficiency, transparency, or
                    modernity in its transit system. I don't mean to rag on your
                    city, but it doesn't have a reputation for transparent
                    governance or efficiency. $4 for a ride? That's crazy!
                    Denver charges $1.50 and is rated as being the best public
                    transit system in the country. But the real model for
                    transit isn't Denver, because Denver has high city ridership
                    but the suburbs are sprawling disasters. The American model
                    city should be Portland.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Portland, and the state of Oregon, have taken an active role
                    not only in containing sprawl, but pursuing a master plan
                    that incorporates all aspects of city design. Building
                    permits are not rubber-stamped -- they have to be part of
                    the plan. Can you imagine if Python accepted every single
                    patch that came its way, and there was a huge profit motive
                    in patching Python? It'd be a disaster! And that's exactly
                    how a lot of our cities happen. There's no plan or design,
                    just approved building permits.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The city design, including the design of private property,
                    has to be holistic. It has to incorporate transportation,
                    recreation, shopping, open space preservation, and other
                    aspects of city life. If you build a sidewalk along a wide
                    street with strip-malls on each side, that doesn't encourage
                    pedestrian traffic. It you build a &quot;transit
                    center&quot; in a city with a population density of 400/sq2,
                    that doesn't make it a transit city.

                        BTW, it's $4 round trip, $2 one way. So Chicago is a
                        little on the high end, but not at all abnormal.

                    <p>
                        Chicago's El infrastructure is certainly not
                        representative of new construction. Much of it is -- as
                        infrastructure goes -- pretty ancient. They started
                        building it out 100 years ago, after all. I think New
                        York and London have the same issues. Modern heavy
                        rail/subway systems are much faster. The El in
                        particular seems to be hard to maintain -- putting 20
                        ton cars on metal stilts is not very maintainable. Real
                        upgrades take years of interrupted service, so that's
                        not very feasible either. The result is a pretty slow
                        train system. I think the Brown Line (one of the
                        slowest) averages 15mph (including time at stations).

                    <p>
                        Chicago has crazy sprawl in the suburbs, but I'm not
                        even considering them at this point -- there's still a
                        very large urban area of Chicago of medium density
                        that's not being well-served. I bring it up in part to
                        shoot down another mass-transit-phile argument, that if
                        you just had the right urban planning this would be
                        easy. Chicago proper has planning that is amenable to
                        mass transit, but it still doesn't work very well. We
                        have a decent amount of bikers (by US standards) and
                        lots of pedestrians, and lots of people that don't own
                        cars. Everything other cities are trying to achieve. And
                        it still doesn't work. There's no significant natural or
                        manmade barriers to non-car traffic in the city, which
                        is better than lots of places. But it still doesn't
                        work. Box stores with parking lots in front have made up
                        a sad amount of new development in Chicago, but most
                        commercial space is still right on the sidewalk. We have
                        12k people per square mile. We have alleys, and we don't
                        have many driveways crossing sidewalks. We have lots of
                        one-way streets. Almost all our streets are multi-use --
                        shared and chaotic and cooperative. Chicago has most of
                        the things that New Urbanists talk about. In a lot of
                        ways Chicago is the best of a bad lot. But it still
                        doesn't work!

                        Maybe if a city is just more clever it could work.
                        Adding bike lanes on existing streets next to a parking
                        lane doesn't make for a great bike lane. Building a less
                        centralized set of trains would be better than the
                        spokes we have. Public bathrooms downtown would be
                        super. Sometimes the sidewalk is too narrow. Vehicle
                        pollution is a real problem as a pedestrian; I wish we
                        had better emission controls. Our parks, though
                        generally well used, are mostly quite sterile, and
                        others can be hard to get to, especially with public
                        transit (since the nicer parks are on the edge of the
                        city, and they aren't on the way to anything, so they
                        get worse service).

                    <p>
                        But frankly I'm rather skeptical. I've heard lots of
                        good things about Portland's planning and transit. But I
                        still think we need something a bit more radical. I feel
                        like a lot of the reaction against the suburbs is just
                        reaction, just reactive, just trying to fight against
                        something. I know what they are fighting for, too; but
                        it's caught up in values and goals that can't be
                        transferred, or are too hard to transfer, and too hard
                        to get people to care about. But real functional
                        improvements are much easier to express and convert
                        people to than these vague values we have. The best
                        planning isn't just pleasant, but it's inclusive and
                        expansionist and functional and productive. Those are
                        the defining attributes of America -- and the suburban
                        style of planning has lived up to those things, as ugly
                        and impersonal and wasteful as the result is.

                            See my reply below about radical changes. Portland
                            did a lot of things right. If you haven't been there
                            it's quite an enjoyable experience. Not just the
                            transit, but the little parks downtown, Powell's
                            books, etc. The transit is cheap. The MAX light rail
                            goes east, west, and north into the suburbs (and
                            would have gone to Vancouver WA if they hadn't voted
                            it down). The east line was the first, unfortunately
                            it has way too many stops. But they built it in open
                            woods in Gresham where they wanted development to
                            occur, rather than letting sprawl happen and then
                            having to take out businesses for it. But many
                            people I know live in southeast Portland which has
                            no MAX, and you have to wait half an hour for a bus
                            on Sundays. This even though it's an inner-city
                            neighborhood close to downtown.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Seattle has a better bus system, more frequent,
                            almost 24 hours to the inner neighborhoods and the
                            airport, and almost as cheap. But it's
                            <em>only</em> buses. So if there's a
                            baseball/football/basketball game or just an
                            everyday accident, you'll be sitting still for a
                            while. They are building light rail, and we almost
                            had a monorail too but it was cancelled. (Not the
                            60s monorail; I mean one that residents could
                            actually use.) The regional organization that's
                            building the light rail, Sound Transit, refused to
                            consider monorail or PRT because &quot;light rail is
                            the only system proven in the US, so it's the only
                            system we can get a federal grant for&quot;. The
                            monorail advocates said screw the federal funding,
                            we'll build it ourselves. It would have covered the
                            west side, where light rail was not slated.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            It sounds like you've read Jane Jacobs (The Death
                            and Life of Great American Cities); she was the
                            first New Urbanist if you want to call it that, and
                            has many good ideas about making cities human-scale
                            even though she was writing in the 50s. Basically,
                            things have to be &quot;small&quot;. There can be a
                            lot of small things over a large area, but no huge
                            housing developments or lonely big buildings.
                            Chicago... is partway there, but still has more
                            &quot;bigness&quot; than it needs. I think it was
                            Clark Street between Belmont and Fullerton that I
                            felt that, near some big block-long stores. And
                            Fullerton near Orchard Street; things felt a little
                            more spread out and residential than they had to be.
                            (I don't believe in pure residential areas.) I don't
                            know about Chicago parks, but Jacobs points out that
                            parks in general must be laid out for the
                            convenience of the park user, not built arbitrarily
                            to look pretty. So many parks have empty benches...
                            because they're not in places where people want to
                            sit. People want to watch other people, so benches
                            near other people get well used. Plazas get well
                            used for the same reason. Does Chicago have any
                            central plazas? Those are rare in the US, but
                            they're the things that could make the biggest
                            difference in making a city &quot;comfortable&quot;
                            if done right. But they have to be close to people's
                            houses or wherever they would normally be anyway.
                        </p>

                            Transit suffers from the same problem: you have to
                            start with what the riders want. Speed, frequency,
                            comprehensiveness. Most transit systems fail on all
                            three counts. Cities don't build what transit riders
                            want; they build the minimum necessary to get the
                            advocates to shut up. Or they delude themselves that
                            one light rail line will solve everybody's transit
                            needs.

                    While I mostly agree with what you say, existing mass
                    transit tends to be not much better than cars, I have to
                    take issue with this statement:
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                    A highway lane of car traffic transports far more people

                    I don't think this is in any meaningful way true. Typical
                    theoretical rail capacity per unit land area is 5-10 times
                    that of human piloted highway systems. While Chicago has far
                    more auto commuters than rail commuters, it also has vastly
                    more highway lanes than rail lines.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It's certainly true that the El doesn't use its capacity
                    particularly well, but I believe its throughput were unit
                    area is still much better than the highway system,
                    especially at rush hour.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This is one of the less discussed benefits of transit, the
                    Car Free Cities folks are big into the benefits of lowering
                    transportation footprint for density and overall livability,
                    I think they have a reasonable point.
                </p>
                <p>
                    With that said, I'm all for better systems than light rail.

                    The main problem is that cities in the US weren't designed
                    so people could live within walking distance of work and the
                    store and nightclubs and the like. Then people wouldn't need
                    much transportation. A few older neighborhoods are walkable,
                    and -- surprise, surprise -- these happen to be the most
                    desirable addresses and have the highest real-estate value.
                    You'd think the zoning regulators would get a clue and build
                    more neighborhoods like that, enough to saturate the demand
                    and bring the prices down. Especially since people in those
                    neighborhoods use half as much energy per capita as others.

                    The automobile is so dead. The game is up not when the last
                    drop of oil is used, but when half of it is used. Then the
                    price will rise significantly and rapidly. There's
                    disagreement in the oil industry on when it will occur, but
                    David Goldstein (Out of Gas: the End of the Age of Oil)
                    argues it could come in four years. All the 30-year
                    predictions fail to account for the ever-increasing demand
                    in China and India, and assume the US level will remain
                    steady and not increase (fat chance). Some other countries
                    have good public transportation and walkable cities to fall
                    back on, but the US has pissed away most of its
                    opportunities. This should really worry us. A terror attack
                    is nothing compared to a 15-year depression until
                    alternative-fuel cars become viable on a mass scale. What's
                    going to happen when 80% of Americans can't get to work
                    because they can't afford gas for their SUV, and the public
                    transit line that would have taken them to work was never
                    built?

                    Low-volume cars really are the problem. See all the empty
                    space around the person that's taken up by the vehicle. Feel
                    the weight of the vehicle, how much power is required to
                    move it. I've heard a double-length bus gets three miles a
                    gallon. At that rate you only need twelve people to
                    compensate for a 36 MPG car -- and the bus has room for
                    forty more people, all within three car lengths. The reason
                    there's traffic congestion is the planners won't dare to
                    build a system that would <em>really</em> accommodate 1.2
                    cars per person. You'd need freeways a mile apart, and
                    parking lots significantly larger than our current ones.
                    That was already recognized in the 50s, and the freeways
                    were proposed, but even the most freeway-happy cities won't
                    swallow that much roadway. Now several cities including
                    Phoenix and my hometown Seattle are slated to get a million
                    more people in the next twenty years. One extra freeway and
                    a few park and rides won't be enough.

                    Good public transportation has to be faster than a car, come
                    every five minutes including evenings and Sundays, and cover
                    all portions of the city. Places that do this, like Moscow,
                    London, and NYC, find a significant number of residents
                    don't need cars or want cars. It can be done in small cities
                    too: Germany is doing it. Duesseldorf and even Bielefeld
                    have streetcars that go underground downtown, Duesseldorf
                    has a train station right at the airport that links to any
                    city in Germany, and a 24-hour commuter train to Cologne and
                    Essen. AND comprehensive night buses, at least on Friday and
                    Saturday, so you can get home from the bar without driving.

                    Unfortunately, so many cities think they can just do one
                    light rail line and that's enough. It's enough
                    <em>if</em> your house, job, and evening activities are all
                    near the line. Otherwise you're stuck in traffic, have to
                    pay insurance on a car, etc. Try three lines or maybe six,
                    and then you'll see half the residents ditch their cars. But
                    it has to be in a grid, not an octapus like the Chicago EL.
                    If Chicago had a half circle connecting all the lines, usage
                    would more than double because there would be many more one-
                    and two-segment trips possible without going downtown and
                    back. Note that a grid (which need not be rectangular or
                    uniform) is similar to PRT loops, although larger. The PRT
                    articles I read said it's not suitable for very large cities
                    like Chicago. The large numbers of people would overwhelm
                    it. But it could complement the El or Metra in outer
                    neighborhoods or suburbs. Seattle (500,000) is considered a
                    good size for PRT.

                    Chicago and NYC may suck, but they're more convenient than
                    anywhere else in the US if you don't have or don't want a
                    car. Although it's sad Chicago is just letting the
                    infrastructure deteriorate. Why don't they modernize the
                    tracks and use rubber-tired cars so the El wouldn't be so
                    painstakingly slow and loud? I remember sitting in an
                    almost-empty train car at rush hour and being baffled. In DC
                    the metro is full even at 10:30pm.

                    Decentralized paths is a good point in general. Inner cities
                    are less congested because they have grid streets, so there
                    are several paths to anywhere and each person chooses a
                    different one, and they can detour if there's a bottleneck.
                    But suburban neighborhoods often have only one road going in
                    and out of them, with dead-end streets and cul-de-sacs off
                    it. These get significantly more congestion. I'm not sure
                    decentralized paths is feasable with transit, however.

                    What's this about light rail using more BTU than cars or
                    buses? That sounds highly suspicious. Five vehicles chained
                    together use less energy than five separate vehicles, and
                    the tracks should provide less resistance than the roads.

                        I think PRT people undersell it, sometimes for dumb
                        reasons. They still want the mass transit people to like
                        PRT. The die-hard mass transit people can't stand PRT it
                        seems. They love the <em>idea</em> of mass transit. The
                        biggest critics of PRT are mass transit people; they are
                        tedious but incredibly consistent. Hell, I hear Ken
                        Avidor is even trolling Seattle discussions now (he's
                        been a long time Minneapolis troll).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Everything I've seen indicates that PRT can support more
                        throughput for less infrastructure cost, and with less
                        right of way than any mass transit system.
                        <em>Maybe</em> NYC subways pay off better, but NYC has a
                        unique level of ridership (at least in the US). So,
                        putting aside New York, I think PRT has more potential
                        than any other system, regardless of density. If the
                        infrastructure costs are lower, and the experience is
                        better, and the operational costs are lower, then
                        density shouldn't be a problem. It just means you get an
                        even better level of service as the system is built more
                        densely.

                        That doesn't mean Chicago is the right first location
                        for PRT. It would be an excellent first location -- I'd
                        be delighted of course -- but there are other places
                        more desperate for new kinds of transportation, and
                        without any real alternatives. In those locations PRT
                        isn't just a better choice, but maybe the only real
                        opportunity for a solution.

                        lists energy for several systems. It actually puts a bus
                        as on par with light rail, and both above cars.
                        Generally speaking, this applies to a non-commuter
                        system -- i.e., one that doesn't just carry a consistent
                        (and high) level of commuter traffic, but also provides
                        service at non-peak times.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Also, light rail is really really heavy. I'd guess that
                        pound-per-passenger it's on par with a car.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Remember also that this is BTU per real passenger mile.
                        Real trains aren't full all the time. They get less full
                        as they reach their terminal point. There is directional
                        traffic, so they are full in one direction and empty in
                        the other. There is varying usage at different times of
                        the day, and you can't get smaller than one car. So all
                        of these numbers are based on the actual ridership seen
                        in real systems. And the nature of mass transit is it
                        can never provide good service while consistently
                        running anywhere close to capacity -- it's just
                        structurally impossible for those systems.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Lastly, five cars isn't that much more efficient. Amount
                        of stopping and starting and the weight of the vehicle
                        mostly determines the fuel efficiency. So five cars
                        isn't that much more efficient than one. And they are
                        just crazy heavy, and they stop and start all the time.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Current PRT systems aren't actually that much lighter
                        than a car (though it's an immature technology and so I
                        would certainly expect systems to get dramatically
                        lighter). I think most designs have 1 ton cars. The
                        advantages are that they travel slower, stop and start
                        less, and operate only on demand. The energy efficiency
                        is partly in the freedom you get in a lighter, simpler,
                        more modern system; but most of the efficiency is in the
                        basic design of the system, the
                        <em>non-mass</em> aspect.

                            I'm not against PRT. It's just that we just finished
                            a 10-year debate on light rail vs monorail vs PRT vs
                            more buses, and the worst choice won. A light rail
                            that has traffic crossings in two sections, and
                            whose first phase is not where the bulk of
                            population is. But I learned that in order to get
                            anything done, you have to get everybody to agree,
                            or at least enough of the movers and shakers. That's
                            the problem with PRT. Not that it's intrinsically
                            bad, just that it gets laughed off the table. Nobody
                            wants to commit millions of dollars to be the guinea
                            pig. We got the same complaints about monorail but
                            were able to point to working systems in Japan,
                            Malaysia, and Las Vegas. I would like to see PRT
                            tried citywide somewhere, and Joe who suggested
                            Phoenix may be onto something. Nobody has been able
                            to find a better solution for post-WWII automobile
                            cities, so PRT could be it. But it would take a very
                            forward-looking city to consider it, with much risk.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The capacity argument was specifically directed at
                            London and Los Angeles, saying that PRT could not
                            handle hundreds of thousands of people going
                            downtown all at once. I assumed Chicago was the same
                            size and dynamic, but you know more about it than I
                            do. PRT is like an elevator system or supermarket
                            check-out line. It works excellent when under
                            capacity, but deteriorates rapidly when it reaches
                            capacity. So PRT complements a trunk system rather
                            than replacing it, and would work in individual
                            neighborhoods or districts or medium/small cities
                            (including most of the US). PRT is good if there are
                            five or ten people at a stop, but not for clearing
                            out a baseball game.

                                I agree that traditional transit activists have
                                had an effect on the way that PRT is sold. PRT
                                proponents now tend to shy away from pushing PRT
                                as a replacement for traditional transit.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The problem, it seems, is that traditional rail
                                activists fought back hard, and dirty. A lot of
                                them (Avidor in particular) have resorted to
                                outright lies and scare tactics in their
                                propaganda campaign. So I think that caused PRT
                                proponents to back off the assertion that PRT
                                could replace most rail systems.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I certainly don't think it's a technical
                                limitation. From what I've seen, a mature PRT
                                system could easily serve a large city like
                                Chicago, assuming of course it was extensive
                                enough to cover the whole city. Don't forget,
                                when you look at cities like Chicago and New
                                York, you are comparing PRT to existing systems
                                that would probably cost trillions of dollars to
                                construct in today's network. With that kind of
                                money, a monstrous PRT network could be built,
                                and well-designed PRT scales better than any
                                other form of transit because of the network
                                effect.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                So I think the stated PRT limitations are
                                motivated more by political concerns than
                                technological ones.

                    Hmm. Are you sure that rail infrastructure is more expensive
                    to maintain than road infrastructure? I always heard the
                    opposite.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The problem is, as you say, that the road network is
                    packet-switched whereas rail is closer to circuit-switching.
                    Rail needs a lot more flexibility. Plus the rail network is
                    harder to upgrade on an ad-hoc, piecemeal basis than the
                    road network.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A couple more suggestions for upgrading the rail network :
                </p>
                <ul class="simple">
                    <li>
                        some carriages dedicated to bike-racks / Segway racks to
                        encourage interop between bike and rail.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        upgrade the signalling network with GPS in trains,
                        sensors on the tracks, maybe RFID somewhere.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        some kind of newer, cheaper junction that makes it easy
                        to connect new track to the existing one. Eg. including
                        turntables for tight corners.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        open the network to let more companies run their traffic
                        on it. For example, a big supermarket located near a
                        rail-line should be able to build it's own connection,
                        direct from the checkout to the railway.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Better supermarket-trolley / train inter-op. Maybe an
                        automated link. Pay for your groceries, watch as your
                        trolley rolls away on rails, right out of the store and
                        into a container for loading onto the next train. Pick
                        it up at the station local to your home.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>A view from a different kind of city can be interesting.</p>
                <p>
                    In Bologna, like in most Italian cities, excessive car use
                    is causing serious air pollution. Most streets are too
                    narrow for fancy transport systems and reserved lanes;
                    parking a car is expensive (in private garages or
                    underground parking lots), or difficult, or illegal, and
                    usually inconveniently distant from one's destination;
                    digging a subway is out of the question.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The main parts of the city center are closed to private
                    traffic (except for residents), with automatic license plate
                    recognition from surveillance cameras. This automated fining
                    system has been kept turned off for years and its startup
                    last year has caused a lot of income for the city but an
                    insufficient reduction of traffic; illegitimate travelers
                    persist and legitimate travelers are still too many.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Public transport consists of buses, of which only a small
                    minority are electrical, and frequent trains to nearby
                    towns. Buses are highly undependable: often very late or
                    missing due to traffic, frequently diverted without warning
                    and with complex variants of each line.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Both suburban trains and buses stop very early in the
                    evening, turning off many potential users. For example, the
                    Bologna-Vignola railway has a stop very near the large
                    basketball court in Casalecchio (about 10 km away); the last
                    train back to Bologna leaves well before the start of
                    evening games or pop concerts.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The only improvements would be brutal restrictions to
                    polluting traffic (but these people vote...) and budget
                    increases to have more buses on the (now less cramped)
                    streets. It is not a matter of low volume or low value
                    traffic: every single car in the city center, either moving
                    or parked, is a problem by itself; with few exceptions it
                    shouldn't be there and its driver is a lazy asshole.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Instead, following the immortal public policy principle of
                    spending money now and solving problems later, a largely
                    redundant &quot;light&quot; rail system between the airport
                    and the central train station is being planned.

                    There's been a lot of mention of New York City in this

                        ten-minute walk to a station is considered long.

                    <li>
                        Bus coverage is very extensive. There is almost nowhere
                        in the city that isn't within a couple blocks of a bus
                        stop.

                        Express trains are the fastest way to get around the

                        probably use an express train for some of your trip.
                        Even local trains are often faster than driving, taxis,
                        or buses.

                                Often not convenient if Manhattan is not part of
                                your itinerary. For example, here in Brooklyn,
                                the A and C line passes two blocks away from a
                                major hub at Atlantic Avenue / Pacific St. where
                                nine subways AND the Long Island Railroad all
                                meet, and it DOESN'T CONNECT WITH A SINGLE ONE
                                OF THEM. wtf? If you want to connect those
                                lines, you have to go to Manhattan (and in some
                                cases the lines don't connect there either). (Or
                                get out and walk between stations and pay
                                another $2 if you don't have a monthly or weekly
                                card.) The G does the same thing, which is
                                especially annoying to me as it's the only
                                direct train from central Brooklyn to
                                Williamsburg and northern Queens. There are a
                                number of other such oddities.

                        The stations, while many look better than they used to,
                        are still far from pleasant. Cold in the winter, hot in
                        the summer. Summertime brings the fragrance of piss and
                        garbage (and at Canal Street, rotten fish). You can
                        always amuse yourself while waiting for a train by
                        watching the antics of rats and mice eating garbage on
                        the tracks. Lovely.

                    p.s. Ian, you might want to rethink the idea of having bus
                    drivers be more aggressive. Have you ever ridden a
                    jam-packed bus, being forced to stand up and trying not to
                    crush / get crushed by your neighbors while the driver
                    alternates stomping on the accelerator and the brakes? It's
                    pretty tiring, even nauseating at times.

                        Car insurance alone is insane - I paid $2500 / year
                        before I sold my car, and that's not at all unusual.
                        This for a $4000 car!

                        Street parking is for people who have no money or don't
                        value their time. I used to spend as much as an hour
                        EVERY NIGHT driving in a spiral pattern away from my
                        Brooklyn apartment looking for a free parking space. The
                        alternative was to spend $250 or so for a monthly
                        parking space in a garage; at the time, beyond my means.
                        In many areas, you have to re-park your car every single
                        day even if you don't use it every day, because of
                        alternate-side street cleaning schedules.

                        Since selling the car, I have been remarkably untroubled
                        by anxieties that my subway might get me killed or
                        injured in an accident. NYC transit reported something
                        like 125 fatalities citywide over five years. There are
                        more than that every year in auto crashes just in
                        Brooklyn. Then there's the legal thrills of accidents in
                        our litigious society. I have a pending (bogus) lawsuit
                        against me for a car crash in 2001. That's never going
                        to happen on the train.

                        I also don't have to worry about my subway getting
                        stolen, broken into, vandalized, ticketed for bad
                        parking, or towed.

                    At some point it occurred to me that the money I spent on
                    insurance, parking, and maintenance was a lot more than I'd
                    spend if I got an occasional taxi or car service and the
                    occasional weekend or half-day car rental. So I do that, and
                    I joined Zipcar (

                    ) (much like Flexcar or IGO). Haven't regretted it at all.
                    There are now several zipcars parked literally around the
                    block from my house.

                    I live in Manchester, a UK city with about 2.5 million
                    people, the first industrial city. Pretty much all transport
                    seems to suck here (unless you are close to a main line rail
                    station). They are slowly rebuilding the metrolink tram
                    network, but it is closer to a light rail network than a
                    tram (streecar) network. The trams used to go everywhere,
                    until they pulled up the rails 50 or more years ago (or just
                    tarmacced over them). Trams are pleaseant and reliable
                    compared to buses. We need many more of them. Whenever I go
                    to cities in europe, especially eastern europe, they still
                    have extensive urban tram networks, it makes getting around
                    so easy. Perhaps the best public transport I have found has
                    been in Vienna, where there is a good tram network combined
                    with a good underground network.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the end though I'm disorganised so I need to get
                    everywhere by the quickest possible means of transport,
                    which in the city means by bike. I live in hope that one day
                    the city council will realize that cycle lanes on the
                    pavement (pedestrian bit - sidewalk?) are completely useless
                    and just paint lanes on the road.

                        Ken Avidor is an anti-PRT extremist. He spends much of
                        his free time searching for PRT discussions and
                        inserting links to his anti-PRT propaganda pages. He
                        also seems to be trying to increase his Google profile
                        by spreading his links all over the place, so when you
                        search on PRT, you get his pages near the top.

                                promote radical right wing politicians. He logic
                                goes something like this: some two-bit local
                                conservative politicians in Minnesota happen to
                                support PRT, therefore all PRT supporters are
                                promoting the right wing agenda!

                                article. We had to defend that article from
                                relentless attacks by Avidor, and the defense
                                got heated at times. Avidor wanted to kill the
                                whole article because he can't stand the thought
                                of a logical, reasonable presentation of the
                                very thing he is trying to smear.

                                    There are serious problems implementing PRT
                                    systems, both technically and politically.
                                    PRT or Personal Rapid Transit is a set of
                                    autonomous on demand vehicles on a track or
                                    guideway. No systems to transport people
                                    have been implemented in 40+ years. One
                                    large scale system was a complete failure,
                                    the Denver Airport Luggage Handling system,
                                    a PRT for suitcases, which was operated by
                                    United Airlines.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    The system had hundreds of millions of
                                    public money, 20+ miles of track, thousands
                                    of autonomous vehicles, hundreds of
                                    destination points built to handle all
                                    luggage at Denver in a new airport. Never
                                    worked, only United Airlines used a small
                                    portion to move luggage from the counters to
                                    a human operated luggage area. United shut
                                    the luggage eater down last year due to high
                                    operating costs and as a final insult, the
                                    $186 million of PRT system debt was dumped
                                    on the public in December 2005 as United
                                    Airlines went bankrupt.

                                    Civil engineers and state-county-city
                                    politicians are well aware of the fiasco.
                                    Indeed, many studies of this engineering
                                    cockup by MIT, etc were done, check google
                                    for references. The usual reply to this
                                    failure is that &quot;it is not REAL
                                    PRT.&quot; Like, duh, suitcases are not
                                    people and computers are somehow
                                    &quot;better&quot; now. This argument is
                                    weak and now PRT is widely known as
                                    &quot;faith based transit&quot;.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Another fallacy cited by PRT boosters is
                                    comparing it to &quot;packet switching&quot;
                                    networks as if a pod of people are a tcp/ip
                                    packet going through a router. This has some
                                    problem as &quot;packet switching&quot; has
                                    collision rates and methods to over come
                                    high collision rates of packets. I think the

                                    collision rates of pods would be nil so this
                                    packet switching analogy is not such a good
                                    description. Applying network theory and
                                    algorithms to human systems is interesting
                                    but easier with a &quot;social network&quot;
                                    rather than a transportation network.

                                        &quot;George Jetson&quot; has been
                                        active recently in spreading the

                                        message. He has posted elsewhere as
                                        &quot;John Denver's Ghost&quot;,
                                        &quot;Joe 8pack&quot;, &quot;Joe

                                        baggage system failure is proof that no
                                        automated system can work. It's a
                                        technophobic argument that doesn't
                                        acknowledge the fact that the Denver
                                        fiasco was just plain bad engineering --
                                        something that can be corrected -- and
                                        not some fundamental technological
                                        limitation.

                                        Besides, if we're talking about purely
                                        automated systems, Morgantown
                                        &quot;PRT&quot; has been operating for
                                        30 years now, completely automated. Now,
                                        Morgantown is not true PRT (it's
                                        classified as &quot;group rapid
                                        transit&quot;) but it is a fully
                                        automated human transport system. And as
                                        long as people are bringing up the
                                        Denver baggage system to bash PRT, well
                                        Morgantown is much closer to PRT than
                                        the Denver baggage system, and
                                        Morgantown WORKS.

                                        It also appears that Mr. Jetson is
                                        trying to insinuate that computer
                                        network &quot;collisions&quot; would
                                        directly translate into PRT
                                        &quot;collisions&quot;. It's another
                                        blatant scare tactic.

                                        Arguments like this might sound
                                        ridiculous to anyone with a technical
                                        background, but these tactics do have an
                                        effect on the general public -- people
                                        who don't know better might think that
                                        PRT designers are actually designing for
                                        collisions! That's why people like
                                        Avidor (and Jetson, if indeed he's a
                                        different person) must be answered
                                        wherever they appear. If their absurd
                                        message goes unchallenged, it has a
                                        better chance of being accepted by the
                                        masses.

                    In order to evaluate transport methods one must factor in
                    all costs. That is notoriously difficult to do, mostly
                    because proponents of cars (eg: capitalist / feudal
                    organisations like Ford et. al.) prefer to bury the truth,
                    lobby governments for free resources, and lie all the way to
                    the bank.

                <p>Why did early mass transit systems in America fail?</p>
                <p>
                    Answer: They didn't. They were entirely successful until car
                    companies bought them up and bankrupted them.
                </p>
                <p>Why do cars look like a good mode of transport?</p>
                <p>
                    Answer: Because all the costs of roads, environmental
                    pollution, fuel subsidies and so on are born by the regular
                    taxpayer. The capital costs of rail (for example) are seen
                    as too expensive while far greater amounts of money are
                    spent on cars.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Ivan Illich showed the true cost of the bicycle makes it the
                    most efficient mode of transport. Mass transit is less so,
                    and cars are the worst offenders.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Mass transit is not acceptable because people have been
                    duped into associating cars with &quot;freedom&quot;. But
                    the mass murder caused by these vehicles is apparently
                    acceptable in the name of capitalism.

                        Well, mass transit is one of the largest corporations
                        which need a lot of money to keep on going, and where
                        they get all that money from, well our taxes obviously.

                    My name is Harold Leese and in a few weeks, I will be losing
                    the public bus service I have largely due to state budget
                    cuts to our cities. I rely on a car because I work 24 hours
                    a day, 7 days a week on a call basis. I tried to stop the
                    busses from shutting down by trying to stop the state
                    transit cuts and working with transit officials to get more
                    riders, but leaders claim that taxes on fuel no longer work
                    and transit advocate groups will not fight back.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In addition, state and regional leaders will not work to
                    make small improvements that would get more riders and make
                    transit taxes work better. I know very well that mass in
                    Detroit and inner suburbs can work very well if we can just
                    improve what we have. Please comment on my mass transit

                    Hello Ian, I've met you in PyCon before. But I don't know
                    you have a passion in transit system too. I completely agree
                    with you on most points in your original post. Let me
                    contribute a little in this discussion.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I think I am qualified as a public transit advocate and
                    anti-car person. My main commute is heavy rail + bike. It
                    takes about 45 minutes door to door one way, or a little
                    more than double compares to car. This is a huge improvement
                    compare to my previous job that required an over 2 hour one
                    way commute by rail. I also own a car and use it a lot to
                    transport my family of three. Given I have only one car
                    between two adults I can still claim my car ownership is 50%
                    below norm.
                </p>
                <p>
                    While San Francisco is credited as having one of the best
                    transit networks in US west coast, if you ask me to rate it,
                    I say it SUCKS. Besides all the reasons you have
                    articulated, an additional problem in San Francisco is
                    politics. The buses travel at snail speed because they often
                    have stops at every street corner. So every time a rational
                    person sees this problem and proposes 'Hey, we can speed
                    things up if we just change the stop to every two street
                    corner!' Always some activists would come up in arms in
                    opposition, citing it will do much harm to the
                    elderly/disabled/poor people. OK, so no change. The entire
                    city shall go at the same pace as the elderly/disabled/poor
                    people.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I too see PRT as public transit's future. As a technology
                    person, when I first learned about PRT, I immediately
                    recognized it as a paradigm shifting idea, an automatic
                    transport system that perform as well as or better than
                    private cars. Being a public transit advocate, one must
                    first eschew the ideology that car is bad, transit is good.
                    Only then can we understanding the performance difference
                    between a point-to-point transport system v.s. fixed-route
                    transit and find a better way forward.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Another reason I am passionate about PRT is from a humanist
                    perspective. It is very sad to see many traffic accident
                    happens from the convolution of cars, bike and people.
                    People make bad judgments, often putting speed ahead of
                    safety. It is much better to take this risky task away from
                    human hand and replace with an automatic system. Years later
                    when all transports become robotic, we will look back and
                    think how barbaric driving used to be.
