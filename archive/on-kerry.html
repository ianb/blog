        <h1>On Kerry</h1>
        <p>
            I saw a documentary a couple days ago on Kerry and Bush, following
            them in parallel through their experiences as men. I don't remember
            the name of the documentary. It didn't affect how I think of Bush.
            Interpreting Bush is just to debate what particular madness they are
            inflicted with, at some point it becomes uninteresting. I know they
            are revolting and cruel, quantifying the exact degree to which they
            oppose and offend all the values I cherish is only of academic
            interest.
        </p>

        <p>
            I'm not a Kerry supporter. I don't like the man, to me it seems like
            he offers no leadership. But after seeing the documentary and his
            life with some continuity, he seemed a little more human. I believe
            <i>he</i> believes he is doing the right thing. He doesn't go
            outside of the lines, he doesn't challenge the status quo, he lacks
            imagination, but I don't think it's a lack of compassion.
        </p>

        <p>
            And I realized I dislike Kerry because he isn't who I want him to
            be. But that's unfair -- he is who he is. He was selected for who he
            was. I can decry the lack of democratic in his party or in our
            nation, I can point out the flaws in the system, but this is tiring.
            Kerry is who he is. The leader I wish he was -- that is not a person
            who will climb to power, certainly not through electoral politics.
        </p>

        <p>
            More than just one man, I realized I wish this nation was something
            it is not. I wish this were a thoughtful nation. I wish this were a
            selfless nation. I wish this were a just nation. Some people become
            most inflamed when they see hypocrisy, but I'm never that bothered
            by it. It is a most minor sin. That we delude ourselves and falsely
            see these virtues in this nation is not so much offensive to me as
            pathetic. Disappointing, but there's an optimism to my
            disappointment -- it disappoints me because I can imagine better.
        </p>

        <p>
            There was a call for bloggers to voice their opinion, without regard
            for being "on topic". So here it is: I might vote for Kerry. But I
            will do so knowing my vote doesn't mean anything. I will vote
            knowing I cannot and never will be able to select the right
            direction for our nation in a voting booth. Now that I feel settled
            on that, it's a relief. If my choices are a bit more constrained,
            maybe at least they'll be more directed.

            I feel the same, but in the South African context, it's slightly
            different.
            <br />

            <br />
            The majority of the social law is where it should be or is heading
            that way in parliament working-group-led reform. And a number of
            strategic Constitutional Court challenges are going the right way
            (specifically w.r.t. equal protection of same-sex couples, same-sex
            marriage, adoption, and so forth).
            <br />

            <br />
            So, on the social side, I'm happy with the ANC government (which I
            voted for, after all).
            <br />

            <br />
            However, when it comes to certain economic areas, such as parastatal
            or other monopolies, implementation issues (including fighting out
            the much-publicised but generally inevitable government corruption),
            they're behind. But they're heading roughly the right way, slowly.
            <br />

            <br />
            But, I just can't think of any group of politicians from any of the
            other parties who would be able to do it consistently faster, and
            who wouldn't try (for example) get back the death penalty for an
            extra few percentage point of votes.
            <br />

            <br />
            So, I choose the best of the available options, so that those worse
            don't start a slide backwards. From what I've seen of US politics,
            the slide backwards seems to lie in another term for Bush.

            I know where you are coming from, Kerry has neither the charisma of
            Clinton, nor the facile certitude of his opponent. But in some ways
            I've come to feel much better about voting for him than I thought I
            would this spring. He strikes me as someone who takes a measured,
            grownup attitude towards his decisionmaking and more and more I
            think we do need a grownup to step in and clean up the mess we've
            managed to make of this country.
            <br />

            <br />
            That said a president has both more and less power than the popular
            imagination attributes to him. The symbolic power wielded by the
            president does not exist in a vacuum and the world sometimes
            amplifies his smallest gesture, but as often mutes his greatest
            efforts. And the real temporal power of the office is hemmed in with
            restrictions practical, moral and legal that can be overcome but
            cannot be ignored; as the present holder of the office is beginning
            to learn.

            I agree with larry, I wasn't much of a Kerry supporter 6 months ago,
            but he's grown on me.
            <br />

            <br />
            There's a good commentary on the "anyone but Bush" theory by Naomi
            Klein:
            <a
                href="http://www.nologo.org/newsite/detaild.php?ID=397"
                target="_blank"
                >http://www.nologo.org/newsite/detaild.php?ID=397</a
            >
            <br />

            <br />
            Her whole thesis is, progressive politics suffers because the
            majority of the discourse is aimed at pointing out how silly Bush
            is. With Kerry, you'll at least be able to have some sort of
            substantive debate.
            <br />

            <br />
            As for the whole, "my vote doesn't count, I'm throwing my hands up
            in the air, doesn't that feel better?" No. Don't do that. Wimp. Suck
            it up and stick to it. No one likes a quitter.

            It's not quitting. It's just an admission of reality. Electoral
            politics are certainly not the only available direction for
            progressive action. At my most optimistic, I might hope that
            electoral politics will be positive in reaction to changes in the
            larger culture. I just don't expect the change to come from those
            politics.

            Just about quitter. You can do a white vote, no ? I mean vote for
            nobody but vote. This is good way to show everybody you disagree the
            current politics of both candidates. I think this isn't a bad
            approach too, even if finding the right candidate is always better.

            I've been getting into politics recently, not so much because I want
            to as because I have to. The world is being FedExed straight to
            hell, and part of the reason why is because more people just don't
            care enough to change it. In a world where 60% voter turn-out is
            considered good, if the people who didn't think their vote mattered
            were to make a coordinated effort, they could elect their own
            choice. However, it should not be underestimated how much the
            current "ruling class" wants to keep things as they are. Because the
            current system is working well for them, even if it isn't working
            for the rest of us.
            <br />

            <br />
            So, this year I registered with a party and started becoming much
            more active. If you are unafilliated you lose out in an important
            part of the process. I selected Republican for a couple of reasons.
            In general I agree with the idea of a smaller government. Oddly,
            while Republicans talk about a smaller government the current
            administration is doing exactly the opposite. Which leads me to
            another reason I selected Republican -- they need my help in
            selecting canidates than the Democrats do. The GW Bush
            administration has done as far as I can tell, a handful of good
            things and a whole pile of bad and very bad things.
            <br />

            <br />
            The thing I find so disappointing is that so many people are still
            supporting him. I think some are supporting him because they think
            they need to to support our troops, which isn't necessarily a bad
            thing. However, I'd say that supporting our troops
            <b>requires</b> us to be very critical of what the current
            administration is doing. Another comment I've heard in favor is that
            Sadam really needed to be toppled. I don't really have an opinion on
            that, I don't know enough about it. However, it's surely the case
            that if it's true that Sadam needs to be ousted, the way you do it
            in a democracy is to prove it to the people and get their support.
            You don't use propoganda, mistruths and lies to get support because
            "you know better".
            <br />

            <br />
            That is what I find most disappointing. The current administration
            has used secrecy on an unprecedented level to control, mistruths and
            lies to gain support, all the while talking about brining democracy
            to another nation. Secrecy is incompatible with democracy. Taking
            action that you can't legitimately get support from the population
            for is not at all democracy.
            <br />

            <br />
            It is indeed disappointing that our system is set up in such a way
            that only two parties can really participate at the highest levels.
            While you can definitely make a huge difference in the smaller runs
            and get a better canidate elected who is going to be a better fit,
            it just isn't going to happen for the president. You basically have
            two choices, Bush or Kerry. I personally think that the current
            libertarian canidate is more like what the country needs right now,
            but my vote for him is basically a vote for Bush, so I went ahead
            and voted Kerry. I live in Colorado, very much a swing state, so
            that really is the case.
            <br />

            <br />
            However we do have a new item on the balot this year, which is
            making it no longer "winner takes all". If that provision goes
            through, Colorado will split their electoral votes based on it's
            popular vote. Meaning that if we could get 20% for a third party
            canidate, they could actually get an electoral college vote.
            Unfortunately, now is a very bad time for this to be going through,
            if you believe that Bush is not the right leader for this country.
            You just can't win sometimes it seems.
            <br />

            <br />
            Currently, I've been volunteering a lot of time with the Kerry
            campaign, but that's been kind of disappointing. I think once the
            election is over I'm going to try working on breaking the two-party
            system. I think that is the most important thing I can do towards
            really fixing the country.
            <br />

            <br />
            Those are my thoughts.
            <br />
