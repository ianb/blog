            I read an article in Rolling Stone about an anarchist who posed as a
            Republican and volunteered with the Bush Campaign in Florida. One
            thing he noted about the people he encountered is that they were
            actively against &quot;cool&quot;.
        </p>
        <p>
            I can understand where they are coming from. At a certain point in
            your life you get over youthful ambitions and you recognize who you
            are and who you are able to be. For many people, &quot;cool&quot; is
            no longer an option, and they recognize that. Recognizing it, they
            might come to hate cool and hate everything it represents.
            Especially with something like cool, because it's something that is
            held over you, it's something that can divide a person from their
            children and their peers. Of course there will be resentment.
        </p>
        <p>
            An analogous situation is when a person considers themself to be
            unattractive -- it's common to see people then deliberately make
            themself <i>more</i> unattractive, as if to prove a point. Like a
            woman who is overweight wearing a large sweatshirt, or a man with a
            deliberately monotonous wardrobe. By willfully ignoring and even
            sabotaging their appearance, they are trying to prove they are above
            appearance. I've done this myself.
        </p>
        <p>
            I have a hard time understanding Bush supporters. I understand
            people have different values and priorities than myself, but that
            doesn't account for the fact that around 50% of the (voting) nation
            will vote for Bush.
            <a href="http://www.mcsweeneys.net/links/bush/"
                >Bush is clearly horrible</a
            >, but no amount of facts seem to matter. But it's not about facts,
            it's about identity.
        </p>
        <p>
            Cool is probably part of it. Cool has always been to the left.
            Listening to the travesty that is Christian Rock shows that it will
            stay to the left. Actually, I've heard some Christian musicians that
            I like (e.g.,
            <a href="http://www.chairkickers.com/low/home.html">Low</a>), but
            they aren't Christian Rock, they aren't always &quot;positive&quot;,
            and I don't think they are respected by Christian Rock People. These
            people don't just hate cool, they hate real art.
        </p>
        <p>
            But it's not just cool, and it's not just art; Kerry isn't cool, and
            he isn't artistic. As has been pointed out before, Bush and Company
            are very anti-intellectual. Anti-intellectualism is powerful,
            because it doesn't just appeal to people with non-intellectual
            identities (of which there are many), but it also distracts from all
            criticism. Once you reject intellectualism, you've rejected
            intelligence.
        </p>
        <p>
            This is not to say Bush and Company are not intelligent. Well, I
            honestly don't think Bush is intelligent (he's a
            <a
                href="http://politicalhumor.about.com/library/jokes/bljokebushpostturtle.htm"
                >post turtle</a
            >), but I'm sure the rest are smart enough. It's not even to say
            that his supporters aren't intelligent. 50% of the nation isn't
            dumb. But that 50% rejects intelligence, rejects intelligent
            discussion, and rejects thoughtful reflection. And I think they do
            it based on identity. Just like a person decides they will never be
            cool, they decide they will never be &quot;smart&quot;, where smart
            means holding a higher degree, or reading literature, or all of the
            other academic and artistic symbols that we associate with
            intelligence. Rather than resigning themselves to a more modest
            self-image, or rejecting the symbols which serve as barriers, they
            reject the idea entirely, even go out of their way to become the
            opposite of the entire idea of intellectualism and intelligence.
        </p>
        <p>
            Bush and Limbaugh and Coulter all appeal to this anti-intellectual
            sense of identity. They remind me powerfully of a school bullies,
            not just their rhetoric but even their presentation, their snide
            laughs and dismissive tones. And just like then it is so very
            frustrating, because though I see their stupidity, I cannot explain
            it to them, for they are too stupid to understand. No, &quot;Ian
            Peein'&quot; is not a clever play on words, and
            &quot;Flip-Flopper&quot; is not a valid criticism of Kerry, but
            there's no real way to make that argument.
        </p>
        <p>
            So, that's my theory. I don't really know anyone who supports Bush
            (or at least who admits to it). The people I surround myself with
            share my values, so it's no surprise there's not a lot of diversity
            of opinion on this matter. I wonder, are there even people who read
            this blog who support Bush? If so, comment! I have so few such
            interactions with people on that side of the fence, it would be nice
            to know if this blog is one of them (well, I guess there's
            <a href="http://keithdevens.com/weblog">Keith</a>).

        <blockquote>
            I'm not US citizen, so my opinions seem totally irrelevant whatever
            they may be. However, I have two opinions about this elections.
            <br />

            <br />
            First I think everybody on this world should get a vote on who's
            getting to be next american president, as the load of bullshit
            produced by the american goverment is something the whole world has
            to bear.
            <br />

            <br />
            Secondly: A president is a decision maker, that means he's carrying
            responsibility and has to take the Blame when he screws up. That's
            what beeing president is all about. Never in his life Bush has had
            to take the blame for the things he screwed up. He's screwed up
            america real bad the last 4 years, and whoever gets next president
            has to cleanup the mess. Because that's near to impossible the next
            president will have to take a lot of blame for things the current
            president screwed up.
            <br />
            I'm not alright with that. I think Bush should be held responsible,
            and the only way to archieve this is by keeping him around the
            office to be there when the errors of the last 4 years come crushing
            down to the ones carring responsibility.
            <br />
            Then, and only then, most american people will realize how bad this
            president really was. And hopefully learn something.

            Much as I would like to see Bush brought to court-martial, I think
            there is a very slim chance of that ever happening, even if he loses
            the next elections.
            <br />

            <br />
            The simple fact that this administration wasn't run from office
            (remember what a simple blow-job can do?) and that around half of
            its citizens still apparently consider voting for the incumbent
            means that this was a collective failure, and that America, its
            citizens, its media and its institutions should collectively be held
            accountable for the long-lasting consequences of this trainwreck.

            The truth is that you cannot understand them anymore than they can
            understand you. If you are really interested you could read Moral
            Politics : How Liberals and Conservatives Think by George Lakoff or
            Don't Think of an Elephant: Know Your Values and Frame the
            Debate--The Essential Guide for Progressives by the same author. The
            first book in particular will help a little in explaining why the
            facts are not good enough for most conservatives. The generally will
            tend to ignore them when they do not meet their version of the
            world.
            <br />
            I am not voting for Bush, mainly for the slew of lies and excues and
            the mess he is leaving my kid with social security and the debt. But
            I know many people that can look past all of that (or ignore it) and
            are voting for him anyway.

            I believe if you keep him around for the next 4 years to screw some
            more chances rise he's beeing courtmartialled. It doesn't matter
            however, because at that time america will be on the brink of
            civil-war anyway.

            As your token righty I'll take this one (actually libertarian, but
            close enough).
            <br />

            <br />
            I think the post that said misunderstanding is a two way street was
            spot on. The anarchist undoubtedly sees Bush supporters as "not
            cool" because he's a friggin anarchist. Working for the Democratic
            campaign he would also find people more serious than those he meets
            at protests marches (because everyone shy of a revolutionary is more
            serious and less "cool" than him).
            <br />

            <br />
            Likewise "Intellectual" is usually shorthand for "disagrees with
            me." People weight the facts differently (your 1.0 is my 0.0).
            Everyone has a set of issues where their position is "simple" (zero
            out most of the facts) where the other side considers it "complex"
            (lots of weighted facts). If you think "simple" only applies to the
            right then you haven't seen the dozens of different causes
            represented at protest marches whos supporters are frothing at the
            mouth
            <br />
            about Palestine, outsourcing, or corporations (saintly, evil, evil
            respectively).
            <br />

            <br />
            Second - as any good ping pong player will tell you - you move to
            the place based on maximizing "can I play the ball there?" and "will
            the ball go there?"
            <br />
            You have limited possibilities of action so you pick the best one
            available. (okay, that was a long analogy). People and nations do
            this too, but since it
            <br />
            isn't ping pong people <b>feel the need to defend their choice</b>.
            Much of the anti-Americanism in my opinion comes from the fact that
            the US has a wider variety of choices than other countries. Friction
            happens when another country defends their position on moral grounds
            when really they made a choice on practical grounds (here is my list
            of possibilities, pick the best one). This causes friction because
            to be consistent you then have to bash the other guy as unmoral.
            This works for individuals too, there are only some possibile
            positions you can take that are consistent with your beliefs. The
            other guy has a different set of possibilities and when they don't
            overlap you get friction.
            <br />

            <br />
            NB, I tried hard to say little inflamatory. If you think this was
            flamebait you don't read the internet much ;)

            I'll add that frequently calling someone else moral/unmoral is just
            posturing (especially when politicians are involved). This is a
            debating tactic, get the other guy to agree on some constraint that
            cuts down the stances he can take without hurting your own. The UN
            is a good example, the US doesn't like it because going to the UN
            means constraining the actions the US can take. Countries that have
            an outsized say in the UN like France want everything resolved in
            the UN because it greatly expands their possibilities. Third world
            dictators <b>love</b> the UN because it is one nation, one vote.
            They are irrelevant everywhere <b>but</b> the UN.

            Jack, first thanks for stepping up ;) I also got one pro-Bush email,
            where the author basically supported Bush on the basis of needing to
            win in Iraq.

            Re: cool: anarchists aren't very cool, and I don't think he meant it

            about this in the article (which I hadn't linked to, but I should
            have) he's actually defending the Repulicans as being more
            egalitarian than the Democrats. I'll quote:

                say that the ideological vision that mainstream Democratic
                politics has offered America since Clinton has been the
                supercool high school, the party of the popular kids. For all
                the talk about the Democrats being the party of inclusion, it
                really doesn't feel that way from the inside.</i

                something other than ambition, and just being part of that
                campaign meant you were in a besieged minority, with the whole
                world out there laughing at you. Kucinich supporters stuck up

                Nobody wears T-shirts that mean something, and nobody looks
                cool. As I would later find out, most Republicans hate "cool"
                ("They all think they're so cool and artistic," griped one woman
                as she watched Fox coverage of Democratic delegates arriving in
                Boston). Many of the parent volunteers I met were especially
                bitter because they think that cool is what liberals use to lure
                their children away. Which they might very well be right about,
                of course.</i

            As far as the people in protests, they are actually on the whole
            very smart informed people. The news likes to find the most
            inarticulate person they can, and then take a 5 second clip that
            makes them seem even less articulate and informed, but that's not
            representative. It is unfortunate that protesters are widely
            misunderstood by the general public. The confrontational manner of
            protests doesn't really help either, but you have to give them
            credit for getting off their butts and doing something. I know lots
            of activists -- and there's many possible criticisms. Old schoolers
            are dry and overwhelming in their intellectualism. Anarchists are
            flaky. There's still some crazy communists who think they are the
            vanguard of the revolution. But being uninformed and simplistic
            isn't generally a valid criticism, it's just one the globalists and
            neoliberals have chosen to glom onto.

                <br />
                For many people, "cool" is no longer an option, and they
                recognize that. Recognizing it, they might come to hate cool and
                hate everything it represents. Especially with something like
                cool, because it's something that is held over you, it's
                something that can divide a person from their children and their
                peers. Of course there will be resentment.</i

            What is the definition of "cool", though? Isn't this different for
            everyone? What you consider to be cool could be totally un-cool to
            me, and vice versa. I think Python, CCGs and lava lamps are cool,
            and thugs, cell phones and piercings are uncool, but my daughter
            probably thinks the opposite. :-)
            <br />

            <br />
            But maybe you are saying that Republicans think that *nothing* is
            cool. Hmm.

            Re: "what's cool": I mean "hip" cool. Cool like you see on TV, cool
            as defined by the mainstream cultural institutions. Cool as a
            personality trait, not an attribute of ideas or things.

            I will support Bush in the election. I would not have made the
            choice to go into Iraq, but now that we're in the country, we have
            to finish what we started and stabilize the country (and the Mid
            East, for that matter). I seriously do not believe Kerry has a plan
            (or the cajones) to do it.
            <br />

            <br />
            I also believe in most of the Republican ideals (except for their
            insane disregard for the environment), so I am really voting for
            ideals in this election, not a particular man.
