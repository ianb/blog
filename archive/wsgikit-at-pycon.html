<div class="document">
<p>Well, it's been a few days since I gave my <a class="reference" href="http://ianbicking.org/docs/pycon2005/wsgi-presentation/slides.html">presentation</a> (hopefully up
with the other <a class="reference" href="http://www.python.org/pycon/2005/papers/">PyCon papers</a> soon).  Those are just the slides --
I'm planning on filling it out with more text and based on some of the
reaction I've gotten.  Slides aren't really that interesting... maybe
when the audio is up.</p>
<p>Anyway, the presentation went pretty well.  I think it was one of the
best attended tracks of the conference.  Maybe that's just because
the <a class="reference" href="http://pyre.third-bit.com/pyweb/index.html">PyWebOff</a> presentation was really popular and people stuck around
;) -- or because it was early enough in the conference that people
hadn't organized many competing open spaces.  The response was good as
well -- I think <a class="reference" href="http://dirtsimple.org">Phillip</a> (who wrote the <a class="reference" href="http://www.python.org/peps/pep-0333.html">WSGI spec</a>) even said it was
the best presentation of the idea behind WSGI that he had heard;
that's cool.</p>
<p>What I really wanted to sell was WSGI and WSGI middleware as a basis
for different web framework developers to cooperate and share, and
I'll try to make that argument again in the paper because I'm really
interested in getting framework developers on board at this point (not
so much framework users).  Once we get our house in order we can get
back to users (and none of this work makes anything <em>worse</em> for
users).</p>
<p>We had several open spaces during the conference related to WSGI.  The
first turned into a bitch session about the problem with Python web
programming -- but that's not very constructive.  I had a chance to
show a few people the code in WSGIKit, hoping that they'd get ideas
about how they could refactor their own code in the same style.  A
couple people were particularly interested -- JJ Behrens (of
<a class="reference" href="http://aquarium.sourceforge.net/">Aquarium</a>) was particularly interested, and we discussed a bunch of
things -- unfortunately Aquarium might not be a good fit, since it
uses coroutines which makes it a little funky.  Jacob Smulyan (of
<a class="reference" href="http://skunkweb.sourceforge.net/">SkunkWeb</a>) expressed interest in the sprint, but I didn't see him at
the conference... maybe he didn't make it.  <a class="reference" href="http://www.amk.ca/diary/">AMK</a> (of <a class="reference" href="http://www.mems-exchange.org/software/quixote/">Quixote</a>) has
been refactoring much of Quixote based on this (maybe in a branch),
and was planning on experimenting with the result on his own site -- I
think Quixote is one of the more decoupled frameworks anyway, so it's
probably a bit more natural.</p>
<p><a class="reference" href="wsgikit.html">WSGIKit</a> in turn has been making some good progress I think.  It's
downright useable (should I be proud of such a low bar? ;), with some
new additions: configuration, exceptions, error reporting,
auto-reloading, and a fairly easy-to-use startup script.  Still needs
more documentation -- I'm not sure if I should start with programmer
documentation of the middleware (which is mostly in the docstrings
anyway), or end-user documentation of the stack, or refining the to-do
application as an example.</p>
<p>Once I feel confident of the error reporting I hope to start putting
it in place at work -- to put something into production I'm much more
worried about an error that I'm not aware of than I am of errors in
general.</p>
