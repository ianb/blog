<p>I tried to set up a DAV fileshare for some family members to share
pictures.  I thought it would be clever and easy.  <a class="reference" href="http://gallery.menalto.com/modules.php?op=modload&amp;name=News&amp;file=index">Gallery</a>?  Can't be
as easy as drag-and-drop.  And I'd use my <a class="reference" href="http://svn.colorstudy.com/home/ianb/indexer.cgi">indexer</a> (enhanced some) to
make the pictures pleasantly viewable through the web.  Slick and
easy?  I didn't want to make the root of the system a DAV share, so I
made <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">/share</span></tt> into a DAV share of the root, with:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
Alias /share /home/family-site/htdocs
&lt;Location /share&gt;
    DAV On
    AllowOverride None
    Options Indexes FollowSymLinks MultiViews
    AuthName &quot;Secure Murphy Site&quot;
    AuthType Basic
    AuthUserFile &quot;/home/family-site/users.auth&quot;
    &lt;LimitExcept GET HEAD OPTIONS&gt;
        require user family
    &lt;/LimitExcept&gt;
&lt;/Location&gt;
</pre>
<p>But no.  For the life of me, I couldn't get the Windows XP people to
connect to the server.  (Windows 2000 worked fine.)  Then I do some
googling, and fine that <a class="reference" href="http://www.hss.caltech.edu/help/unix/admin/web/apache-webdav-xp">XP authentication is stupid</a>, and sends
usernames like <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">family-site.com\family</span></tt> instead of just
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">murphy</span></tt>.  OK... I follow the instructions, and added a few things:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
&lt;IfModule mod_headers.c&gt;
    Header add MS-Author-Via &quot;DAV&quot;
&lt;/IfModule&gt;
&lt;IfModule mod_encoding.c&gt;
    EncodingEngine on
    NormalizeUsername on
&lt;/IfModule&gt;
</pre>
<p>But just to be extra sure I add all the usernames to the
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">users.auth</span></tt> file -- <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">family</span></tt>, <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">family&#64;family-site.com</span></tt>,
and <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">family-site.com\family</span></tt>.  And damn, it <em>still</em> doesn't
work (though it's hard to tell when debugging over the phone).
Now I know why People In The Know know that Web Folders Suck.</p>

<p>I set up a WebDAV folder today to share files in a small office.  I had the opposite problem, windows worked fine but linux and OSX would only mount the folder as read-only.  Turns out doing autoversioning - putting the whole folder under Subversion (saving a file creates a new revision) was the problem.  OSX &amp; Linux want to lock the file but notice apache 2.0 doesn't support LOCK, WindowsXP just writes away.  The 2.1/alpha version of Apache has a fix for this, but I haven't tried it yet (I just made a stab at it today).</p>
<p>Autoversioning is the killer feature for me, the other people would/could not use subversion even if they knew what it was.  They do like the idea of viewing old versions of files, especially &quot;for free.&quot;  So I'll be giving Apache 2.1 a try Real Soon Now.</p>

<p>I ran into this problem just yesterday. Instead of configuring the server to work around XP's stupidity, I stumbled across a way to &quot;trick&quot; XP into doing the right thing by including the port number in the URL. So, instead of entering <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">http://family-site.com/share</span></tt> as the address, I would enter <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">http://family-site.com:80/share</span></tt>.</p>
<p>I don't know why it works but it does. At least it started working for me once I did that.</p>

Hey Jason, I just love you. I was trying around for hours - and your trick did it. Thanks a lot. I wonder whether it has to do with accessing a samba share on the same server at the same time?

Just to echo the last anonymous sentiment.
Thanks a bunch.  I've been pratting about for hours trying to get XP to behave and the port number thing fixed it a trick.
Probably works as the full format of a URI includes username, password and port number in the same string, so putting the port number in completes all the values passed to the server?</div>

<p>Use Novell NetDrive (free) - it's a much better WebDAV client than web folders.</p>
<p>Also, SVN implements autoversioning, but you have to explicitly enable it.</p>

<p>After some days of trying to get this to work I wrote a summary about the problem at <a class="reference" href="http://ulihansen.kicks-ass.net/aero/webdav">http://ulihansen.kicks-ass.net/aero/webdav</a>. Listed six possible solutions on the client and the server-side. Additional ideas are welcome.</p>
