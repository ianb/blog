                I still have
                <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">str()</span></tt>
                calls and
                <tt class="docutils literal"

                methods all over the place, and Unicode sneaks into the most
                unexpected places.
            </p>
            <p>
                Sometimes I think my life would be much, much easier if my
                default encoding was UTF-8 instead of ASCII. Isn't that a nice,
                happy encoding? Sure, a UTF-8 string isn't equivalent to a
                Unicode string. The lengths don't match up, some Unicode-aware
                operations (e.g., operations that deal with letters different
                from punctuation) won't work. Most of my strings are
                sufficiently opaque that I don't care, though. And, doing server
                programming, UTF-8 is a good encoding; there's no such thing as
                locale for me. But even <em>setting</em> the default encoding
                has been made deliberately very difficult.
            </p>
            <p>
                I just really don't know what I <em>should</em> do. Should I
                replace all my
                <tt class="docutils literal"
                    ><span class="pre">__str__</span></tt
                >
                methods with
                <tt class="docutils literal"
                    ><span class="pre">__unicode__</span></tt
                >? Should I set up a boundary where I carefully decode all
                strings, making sure I'm using Unicode <em>everywhere</em> in my
                app? These are rather hard things to do, because
                &quot;inside&quot; is a rather leaky place. There's all these
                libraries other people wrote, external inputs I am hidden from,
                etc.
            </p>
            <p>
                For instance, imagine some library that writes data to a file
                occasionally. Maybe it's a cache; the data is opaque. It expects
                strings. What does it do when it gets a Unicode object? Very
                possibly it writes it, if it is encodable with the default
                encoding (typically ASCII). In fact, this works great for me
                because my name and everything I write is ASCII; I'm not even
                sure how to input anything but ASCII. How do I, the ignorant
                English-speaking-and-typing American, even make a test case?
                Well, sometimes I write
                <tt class="docutils literal"
                    ><span class="pre">u&quot;\u0100&quot;</span></tt
                >
                or something; I don't even know what that character is, but at
                least I know it's Real Unicode. Sucks that it takes 9 characters
                to give me that one Unicode character I want. And in practice I
                usually leave this out of my tests. Then some European comes
                along with an umlaut in their name, and BOOM!
                <tt class="docutils literal"
                    ><span class="pre">UnicodeDecodeError</span></tt
                >
                -- and <em>I</em> didn't even know strings were involved. It's
                not even my library. <em>Nothing</em> is safe from these blasted
                characters. And the problem isn't localized -- Unicode works
                implicitly often enough that the Unicode can leak in long before
                it causes a problem, and a subtle difference like between
                <tt class="docutils literal"
                    ><span class="pre">&quot;%s&quot;</span>
                    <span class="pre">%</span> <span class="pre">obj</span></tt
                >
                and
                <tt class="docutils literal"
                    ><span class="pre">str(obj)</span></tt

                        I suspect it would be better if we had
                        <em>only</em> Unicode text and non-text bytestrings,
                        with a sufficiently different-enough interface that you
                        could tell which one you expected and would work with.
                        Like Java I guess. You'd still have all the problems,
                        but you'd have to deal with them up front, and everyone
                        would deal with them consistenly, and errors wouldn't
                        propogate.

                    There is no such thing like working Unicode support in any
                    language. :-/ The main problem is that there are interfaces
                    needed to the real world - and the real world doesn't like
                    Unicode, it only accepts utf-8. But several libraries try to
                    be smart. For example django uses the email module to parse
                    multipart POST data - that's a logical choice, as HTTP
                    multipart POST data is actually just mime attachements. Of
                    course, email produces unicode strings if you pass in
                    something that's defined as utf-8. And that produces
                    problems in the django code. Or take sqlite3 for example:
                    the pysqlite2 binding allways returns unicode strings.
                    Except if you store data in the database directly with the
                    sqlite command - then it stores what you pass in and what
                    your local encoding is. It's iso-8859-1 in my case - so I
                    can add stuff to the sqlite database that can't be read by
                    the pysqlite2 library. With django this required me to write
                    a row factory that removes the unicode string and replaces
                    it by a bytestring in utf-8 encoding, just to make the
                    django code happy.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Oh, and your blog doesn't accept Umlauts in the comments -
                    it produces a traceback with UnicodeDecodeError :-)

                        Oh, and just before anybody mentions it: both the email
                        module and the pysqlite2 library will happily deliver
                        bytestrings in other situations, so you can't just say
                        to hell with it and all unicode. The email module will
                        return non-utf-8 stuff as bytestrings and the pysqlite2
                        library will give a registered converter not the unicode
                        string but the raw bytestring. For example if you
                        register a (lambda s: s) as the converter, you will get
                        bytestrings.

                        introduced it when I was trying to fix a related

                        byte-strings?) python kind-of recommends
                        byte-strings...well, not exactly recommends..but..for
                        example if you want to write an unicode string you have
                        to prefix it with [u]. so it's usually extra work to
                        enter unicode strings. in java this issue does not
                        exists, because there the strings are unicode. there are
                        no byte-strings (only byte-arrays)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        probably a consequence of #1: many library functions
                        only deal with byte-strings. and what's worse, sometimes
                        (to be sure) they start with somethings like &quot;input
                        = str(input)&quot;. and this of course completely fails
                        when the input contains non-ascii... so you have to be
                        careful...

                    There isn't really a lot of point in <em>hating</em> ASCII.
                    ASCII is fine if you are absolutely sure your code will only
                    ever be used by monolingual English speakers who don't give
                    a sh*t about whether their text looks typographically
                    half-decent (proper quotes, en- and em-dashes etc.)
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you have any interest in your code being used by the
                    other 95% of the world, then ASCII simply isn't an option
                    and you have to find a way to deal with unicode whether you
                    like it or not.

                                <em>did</em> the typographical mark '#' come to

                                through keymap differences? Or is it just a
                                co-incidence that Shift-3 happens to produce the
                                &quot;right pound for the job&quot;?

                    It seems to me like non-ASCII character sets are just not

                    That why you should set the default encoding to something
                    inexistent. automatic conversion from str to unicode or
                    unicode to str is a source of endless bugs. Better to have

                        But sometimes automatic conversion really is the Right
                        Thing. For instance, let's say I have some code that
                        does this:

                    <pre class="literal-block">
def popup(href, title):
    return '&lt;a href=&quot;%s&quot; onclick=&quot;window.open(%r,'_blank')&quot;&gt;%s&lt;/a&gt;' % (
        href, str(href), title)
</pre
                    >
                    <p>
                        Without a
                        <tt class="docutils literal"
                            ><span class="pre">u'</span></tt
                        >
                        this will raise an exception if
                        <tt class="docutils literal"
                            ><span class="pre">title</span></tt
                        >
                        is Unicode, if no default encoding is given. Is that the
                        right behavior? No! This function works <em>fine</em>.
                        This is <em>not</em> a boundary where encoding needs to
                        be defined; in fact, it would suck if you had to encode
                        the title before passing it in, because then you'd have
                        to decode the result of the function as well, so you
                        could re-encode it at the <em>real</em> boundary (when
                        you serve the page). All this because of a missing
                        <tt class="docutils literal"
                            ><span class="pre">u</span></tt
                        >
                        -- and that
                        <tt class="docutils literal"
                            ><span class="pre">u</span></tt
                        >
                        is missing far more often than it is included.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If you can &quot;fix&quot; that function, you're okay.
                        But there's too much code out there that does this now.
                        I simply can't update all the code out there that uses
                        bytestrings instead of Unicode.

                            strings. A solution ( and one of the best in my
                            opinion ) is to do <em>all</em> string handling in
                            unicode.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            You read a string from a file, first thing you do is
                            convert it to unicode. You write a string to a file
                            ? Encode it. Inbetween, always use unicode. If there
                            is some unruly code somewhere, then it's better to
                            ask the author of the code to correct it then to add
                            some workaround somewhere. It is the safest solution
                            that way because there are less hacks involved.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            If really there is some external code you can't
                            change, then consider encapsuling the piece of code
                            in an automatic convert/unconvert routine with utf8
                            as the encoding.

                    As ukrainian developer, I have to deal with Unicode issues
                    regularly.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The only viable strategy to avoid unicode errors for me has
                    been to have clear borders of &quot;Unicode world&quot;
                    within a program. As you noted, this may be tricky but it is
                    doable. Usually I don't strive to have Unicode throughout
                    the program because Unicode is used inconsistently in Python
                    (and, yes, you're going to figure it out the hard way) but
                    it is relatively simple to define a Unicode area within your
                    own code. To document boundaries I usually use asserts.

                    I used to have the same annoyances, but then I learned to
                    stop worrying and love the exceptions :) Or, more
                    prosaically, faced with a large and complex project that
                    required use of Unicode, I sat down and worked out how
                    Python's support for it operates. The conclusion I came to
                    is that Python is actually one of the better (if not best)
                    languages at handling Unicode, as long as you work
                    <em>with</em> it. That is; it presupposes a particular way
                    of handling strings. The faults are more in the explanations
                    and documentation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The project of which I speak is driven by a vast MySQL
                    database, in which [essentially] all strings are Unicode.
                    Since Python tends to promote non-Unicode strings to Unicode
                    as required (in string operations and the like), that means
                    that any textual object must be considered as being Unicode.
                    They come to Python code (via MySQLdb) as Unicode objects.
                    To the console and to files, they are sent as UTF-8-encoded
                    strings.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The general rules I've followed are: (a) Use a console
                    environment that supports UTF8 characters (in my case, PuTTY
                    ssh sessions to Linux boxen). Thus one can print any string
                    that's encoded in UTF8 to stdout in Python code. (b) Assume
                    that all strings are Unicode; when using &quot;print&quot;,
                    convert to UTF8. Since non-Uncode strings also have an
                    &quot;encode&quot; method, this makes life easier.
                    Converting an ASCII string to UTF8 is essentially a no-op.
                    Only encode when writing out from code to files or the
                    console. Only decode when reading in. (c) When creating or
                    reading files, know what encoding format you're handling.
                    That should be as much an attribute of any defined file
                    format as the line-endings or use of Ctrl-Z/EOF. I use BOM
                    marks (as does Windows) via the constants in the
                    &quot;codecs&quot; module to ensure that I tag files
                    appropriately. Writing a generic file reader that spots BOM
                    marks and decodes appropriately is an easy task. (d) Keep in
                    mind that &quot;the console and the world are in ASCII&quot;
                    is a falsehood that will bite you as much as &quot;everyone
                    in the world speaks English&quot; does :) (e) UTF8 is your
                    friend - it'll handle encoding of any Unicode character and
                    if you can't meet rule (a) is still more-or-less printable,
                    though you don't see the strings as intended. (f) the
                    &quot;default encoding&quot; is your enemy. You can't rely
                    on it, it only takes effect in some circumstances and it may
                    bear no relation at all to what the console can or cannot
                    handle.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Given the above, I have never had a problems with rogue
                    Unicode[De|En]codeErrors, and we handle all Western
                    languages plus (recently) Russian and Japanese. Generally,
                    the only times they occur is where I've found an old
                    &quot;print&quot; line that spits some object out without
                    encoding it first.
