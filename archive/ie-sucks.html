        <h1>IE Sucks</h1>
        <p>
            Ian Hickson talks some more about
            <a href="http://ln.hixie.ch/?start=1085764602&count=1"
                >backward compatibility</a
            >
            and advancing the web in the face of IE6. As he lists all the things
            IE can't, won't, and never will do, I think: IE sucks so very much.
        </p>

        <p>
            But, at least IE is a stable platform to react against. You don't
            have to worry about dead end products pulling the rug out from under
            you. Maybe <a href="http://dean.edwards.name/IE7/">IE7</a> is the
            right direction -- it's ironic, though, that IE's competitors have
            to consider improving IE just so their own products' improvements
            are useable.

            Oh, PyDS does - kind of. You can activate the online/offline switch.
            That way you can disable upstreaming. The preview still works.
            Activate upstreaming again and your stuff will go out. Ok, it _is_ a
            bit cumbersom for single posts ;_)

            Oh yes, IE sucks in so many ways. Here's some more food for thought

                    Personally, I have been burnt many times and wasted 100s
                    hours in the past working around IE quirks. Yesterday, it
                    happened again, and I didn't realize it till now, leaving a
                    portion of The CDCer header chopped off by IE for hours!
                </p>
                <p>
                    The cause of the problem is the negative margin surrounding
                    the header block. This is a common CSS practice to control
                    layout, and it worked fine with Firefox and Opera on both
                    Windows XP SP2 and Mac as well as Safari, but not IE 6.0.
