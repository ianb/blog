        <h1>Little Apps Instead of Little Frameworks</h1>

        <div class="document">
            <p>
                We've been doing lots of infrastructure at work lately. A couple
                basic apps have been added to our internal system -- a login
                app, and an admin app. The login app logs you in. That's all it
                does -- it takes your username and password, sets a cookie, and
                redirects you to your destination. That's an application, with
                all the infrastructure an application implies. The admin
                application reads a common config file, finds all your admin
                tools (which are often embedded in other applications) and gives
                you a summary. That's all it does, one page.
            </p>
            <p>
                It took me a little while to really commit to making these
                applications. They are <em>so small</em>, it didn't make sense.
                And yet it does; it's manageable and maintainable, the apps
                works, they do their function.
            </p>
            <p>
                This has been a kind of vaguely defined goal of
                <a class="reference" href="http://pythonpaste.org/deploy/"
                    >paste.deploy</a
                >
                all along, though now that the tools are there I'm starting to
                see more of the potential and what it can mean. I wanted
                applications to be easy to install, upgrade, and compose, so
                that it would be reasonable to make really little applications.
                The quintessential application in my mind was the modest
                formmail script, that just emails all the fields off to someone.
                This classic application remains useful today, but I sure as
                heck wasn't going to set up a new Webware app server instance to
                do it. And sometimes I'd find myself writing to a database just
                to justify the infrastructure. Bad stuff.
            </p>
            <p>
                The login and admin apps take it a bit further -- not only are
                they small, they are also useless on their own. But even though
                their utility is predicated on the existence of other apps,
                their functionality needn't be. And designing around that I find
                the applications have utility even in the context of a
                heterogeneous environment. I don't need to commit to Rewriting
                Everything In My Framework Of Choice.
            </p>
            <p>
                We all know frameworks are a pain in the ass. A lot of people
                have approached this cloud-of-apps problem as a framework
                problem. Sometimes that framework takes the form of a
                &quot;CMS&quot;. These are often not what Python people would
                think of as a CMS -- it's more like PostNuke. Other times you
                have to do really funky things to add in abstraction. Like
                Acquisition, or many of the &quot;component&quot; systems. I
                admit I've made such frameworks and plugins. It ain't pretty.
            </p>
            <p>
                Applications are the new framework! This is kind of what REST
                implies, but those are high-minded ideas around some potentially
                very simple things, and there's still a lot of room in the
                simple end of things, with ad hoc communication on as as-needed
                basis, and complete decoupling whenever possible.
            </p>
            <p>
                I personally really hope to see future tools emerge in this
                form. I don't mind a heterogeneous system. If someone makes a
                really great admin interface for SQLObject classes (something
                I'd like to see happen), I don't care if they write it in Myghty
                or CherryPy or Zope 3 <strong>if</strong> I can install and
                manage it easily. If it's done right (which to me means
                &quot;Paste-Deploy enabled&quot;) then I should even be able to
                embed that application in my own and create a seemingly unified
                whole.
            </p>
            <p>
                So far there's been very little app sharing in Python. We share
                frameworks (sometimes), but frameworks incur loathing. No wonder
                we reimplement all the time. Applications are a good
                alternative.

                    I really like this approach, especially as it relates to
                    easily extending login types. I'm not really a fan of
                    writing my own login/logout scheme for every new web
                    application, plus more advanced login schemes could be done
                    in an external small login webapp, like ISSO and all that
                    single-sign-on stuff.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Of course, that leaves me wondering how such little apps
                    would keep a consistence appearence that actually looks like
                    part of the site they're used with. Probably the easiest way
                    to let the app user decide, would be to intercept the
                    login/logout call, do the function, then &quot;inject&quot;
                    the form to login, etc into the web application. That way
                    the person using the little app would be able to fit it in
                    with their existing website however they wanted. That's just
                    the first scheme that comes to mind though...

                        I have noticed that the single-sign-on stuff tends to
                        have a login process that is a lot more complicated than
                        just asking for a username and password, and a login can
                        take place over several HTTP requests. That's a really
                        hard library to write. But a pretty simple app.

                    <p>
                        That is possible, if you make it possible to include
                        other resources. I.e.
                        <tt class="docutils literal"
                            ><span class="pre">&lt;&lt;include</span>
                            <span class="pre"
                                >&quot;/login/formfragment&quot;&gt;&gt;</span
                            ></tt
                        >
                        which does a subrequest and inserts the result (adapted
                        to whatever your templating language). However, this
                        gets complicated if there's any interaction -- it only
                        really works for displaying the initial form, not the
                        form action or any intermediate screens. And maybe
                        that's okay. The actual form action should be directed
                        automatically to the application, though if you were
                        doing it as middleware you could also just capture some
                        particular pattern.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For other applications, a simple method would be if
                        there were good conventions for how to override
                        templates. Like a template path, with local templates
                        first on the path. You might have to replicate your
                        appearance several times in several templating systems,
                        but if there are good conventions that's not
                        <em>so</em> hard. And it's a useful feature to have even
                        if something better comes along, so I think it's a good
                        start.

                <p>
                    i've been doing this kind of thing for a while now. the
                    original impetus was a quiz building tool. we wanted users
                    to be able to build an online quiz/survey (similar to survey
                    monkey) that could be tied in to other applications
                    (potentially written in any language and running on any
                    machine). so i set up little REST services. when a quiz is
                    created, the author fills in urls for login, verification,
                    etc. services with little placeholders for variables in the
                    urls. when a user goes to the quiz, they get redirected to
                    the login service, they login there, and it sends them back
                    to the quiz app along with a ticketid and username. the quiz
                    app will then, on each subsequent request, ask a
                    verification service if that ticketid/username combo is
                    valid on a backchannel. so now, if we have an application
                    that could use a quiz but has its own notion of users and
                    authentication, the developer on that app just sets up login
                    and verification services against the app's user database,
                    creates a quiz, and plugs those service urls into the quiz's
                    configuration. then we also have a couple stock services
                    that can be used (one that authenticates against the
                    university's id system, a &quot;public&quot; one that
                    essentially allows anyone in, one that checks that the IP
                    address is on campus, etc.)
                </p>
                <p>
                    it was mostly just expanding on the ideas of the CAS
                    single-signon system:
                    <a
                        class="reference"
                        href="http://www.yale.edu/tp/auth/cas10.html"
                        >http://www.yale.edu/tp/auth/cas10.html</a
                    >
                    (actually, on WIND, which is Columbia's clone of CAS).
                </p>
                <p>
                    the really nice thing about building systems this way is the
                    complete flexibility of policy. if someone comes up with
                    some crazy new authentication system that i couldn't have
                    thought up, the quiz tool can still use it as long as they
                    can encapsulate it in a couple simple services.

                    I'm curious, how these apps actually look like? Does it have
                    its own project tree in subversion, its own docs/tests,
                    etc.?

                        Libraries don't work for some problems. Those that
                        involve several repeated interactions with a browser --
                        like single-signon systems -- are one case. In that
                        case, you starting needing a &quot;framework&quot;,
                        which is just &quot;an abstracted application&quot;. And
                        the abstraction is a pain in the butt.

                        As for what they look like: yes, they look like full
                        projects -- separate tree, separate docs, tests,
                        configuration, setup.py.

                    I'm curious about your description of the login app. If all
                    it does is set a cookie, doesn't that mean that your users
                    could simply go to the final destination, skipping the
                    login? If the final destination (and all further pages)
                    needs to retrieve and process the cookie, isn't this the
                    beginning of a framework, since each app-behind-the-login
                    needs to know how the login was done and how to verify it?
                </p>
                <p>
                    Maybe I missed your point and the only goal is to maximize
                    decoupling of implementation details?

                        The cookie would be signed and checked for with WSGI
                        middleware or some other intermediary (like
                        mod_auth_tkt). How you get the cookie is not embedded
                        into the application, and there is a CGI convention for
                        where the unpacked cookie goes (REMOTE_USER); or it
                        could be HTTP auth or whatever. All your app needs to
                        know is to trust REMOTE_USER.

                    Sometimes the login form is embedded into another page (the
                    index page). In that case just let the main app handle the
                    form. The login routine could work as middleware, operating
                    just on that URL, processing the credentials if present, and
                    setting a message for the main application
                    (&quot;success&quot;, &quot;user not found&quot;,
                    &quot;invalid password&quot;). Then if the application has a
                    general way to display messages, it can convert the message
                    to something more reasonable and display it.
