                reminded me of immediates, and how interesting they can get when
                you have 64 bits.
            </p>
            <p>
                As a quick overview of an immediate -- typically an object in a
                dynamically-typed, reference-based language (like Python or
                Smalltalk) will be made up of a memory location. In memory you
                have information about the object type, instance variables, etc.
                So on every operation you get this pointer, find the location in
                memory, and do stuff.
            </p>
            <p>
                With an <em>immediate</em> you put the entire object into the
                &quot;pointer&quot;. To do this, you might reserve the high bit
                to signal that this is an immediate. If it's set, you have 31
                bits left to encode the rest of the object -- more than enough
                for a significant set of integers, and potentially other objects
                (like True, False, and None). It gets exciting with 64 bits,
                because you now have 63 bits of information left, which gives a
                lot of room for storing different objects.
            </p>
            <p>
                For instance, let's say you have a four-bit header for all
                Python references (which is enough to distinguish a string), and
                30 bits to give the string's address (I have no idea how long
                addresses really have to be, but anyway...); that gives you 30
                bits to do whatever you want with. You could store a hash value
                in there, which means that in many cases you could compare and
                use strings without going into the heap (memory) at all. You
                could store the string length (maybe only using some of the
                bits, and limited to strings under a certain length).
            </p>
            <p>
                Immediates can generally only be used for immutable types,
                because an immediate isn't passed around by reference -- since
                the &quot;reference&quot; stores the object directly, it gets
                copied everytime it is re-references (e.g., by assigning it to a
                variable). This is fine for immutables, because multiple
                instances are indistinguishable from a single instance, but for
                mutable values it would cause problems.
            </p>
            <p>
                Some of this can already be done with 32 bits -- this sort of
                optimization is (I believe) common in Smalltalk and Scheme
                interpreters, typically for encoding small integers. And I don't
                believe this is being done at all in the Python interpreter
                (though I don't know for sure -- someone can correct me in the
                comments if I'm wrong). Maybe something else for the

            I'm pretty sure immediates would make the C code of Python pretty
            fugly (you'd have to catch them in all sorts of places), but it
            might be fun to try it out in something like PyPy

            Someone tried to modify the C source to Python to use the least
            significant bit of a PyObect* and have immediate integers. It didn't
            make much difference to performance.
            <br />

            <br />
            Maybe it was Jeff Epler? He's nuts enough to have tried something
            like this :-)

            Also, note that not every architecture in the world is byte
            addressed (though this is less of an issue if you use high bits as
            tags, but then you need more control over how your address space is
            layed out than you get from C).

            That's a good point. The AltiVec unit in the PPC is 128 bit aligned,
            it completely ignores the last four bits. malloc() on OS X is
            guaranteed to give 128 bit aligned pointers for this reason.

            Don't forget Psyco. Psyco doesn't use tag bits, but it does
            "virtualize" objects as simpler datatypes.
