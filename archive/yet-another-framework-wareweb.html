        <div class="document">

                <em>What</em>, you say,
                <em
                    >not another framework!?! The world doesn't need more of
                    those!</em
                >
            </p>
            <p>
                Well, I respond: I have been not-writing-my-own-framework for
                <em>years</em> now. Frankly, I deserve a break from not writing
                frameworks.
            </p>
            <p>
                But mostly I like
                <a class="reference" href="http://webwareforpython.org"
                    >Webware</a
                >. I think it has a lot of good aspects. So I wrote something
                like it, but newer. Webware's basic model is good:
            </p>
            <ul class="simple">
                <li>
                    Class hierarchy (the
                    <tt class="docutils literal"
                        ><span class="pre">SitePage</span></tt
                    >
                    often used in Webware) is a nice way to share code and build
                    application-specific mini-frameworks.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The simple one-file-per-screen approach is easy to use, and
                    easy to disect from the outside.
                </li>
                <li>
                    It emphasizes UI first, and abstract data modeling second.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                It's not the only framework like this. But anyway, I still like
                it. Still, there's lots of specific things that annoy me. It's
                an old framework, from the Python 1.5 days. Python has changed a
                lot since then. But Webware is still using getter and setter
                functions, and it has lots of cruft, and internally it has more
                hierarchy and abstraction than it needs -- most of it not used
                for anything. It's also missing a few things I find really
                important -- things I added with
                <a class="reference" href="http://wiki.w4py.org/component.html"
                    >Component</a
                >, but that would be better in the core.
            </p>
            <p>
                The result is that I have often found myself having to apologize
                for crufiness in Webware. Or explaining the history of its
                decisions (most of which were made well before I started using
                it). I sometimes find myself typing more than I want (like
                <tt class="docutils literal"
                    ><span class="pre"
                        >self.request().environ().get('HTTP_HOST')</span
                    ></tt
                >).
            </p>
            <p>
                So... in comes
                <a
                    class="reference"
                    href="http://svn.pythonpaste.org/Paste/trunk/paste/wareweb/"
                    >Wareweb</a
                >, wherein I try to distill the parts I like in Webware, and
                avoid the parts I don't like or don't think are important. I'm
                actually still using Webware for all my work projects (I'm now
                running it under
                <a class="reference" href="http://pythonpaste.org">Paste</a>,
                but Webware all the same), and this is more experimental than
                anything (with only
                <a
                    class="reference"
                    href="http://svn.pythonpaste.org/Paste/trunk/examples/filebrowser/"
                    >one real app</a
                >). Which is why it has no real web page, and not much
                documentation (but I think it doesn't need much documentation).
                But I like it, it's satisfying.
            </p>
            <p>
                So, if anyone is curious about what a framework written by me
                looks like, there you go.

                <p>Horray! Welcome to the club! ;)</p>
                <p>
                    Ya know, I'm tired of this whole push to get everyone on the
                    same page ;) In a certain sense, it just doesn't matter.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Let's face it, Aquarium has 7500 lines of code (half of
                    which is API documentation). The main application I work on
                    has 79000 lines of code, and that's just the GUI! No, I'm
                    not a wasteful coder, it's a frickin' big app! Guess which
                    one people care about, Aquarium or the app? ;) Why do we
                    spend so much time arguing about the 7500 lines of code.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I guess it's because it has such a large impact on how the
                    other 79000 lines of code are written. :-/
                </p>
                <p>
                    On the other hand, if you need to do as my company did and
                    write a 79000 line application, no one much worries about
                    coding an extra 7500 lines of code so that things work
                    exactly as you want.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Nonetheless, I'm an open source zealot. We share where we
                    can, eh?
