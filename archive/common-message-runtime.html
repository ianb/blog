<p>With <a class="reference" href="http://blogs.msdn.com/hugunin/archive/2006/09/05/741605.aspx">IronPython 1.0</a> out,
I was thinking of some of the issues of supporting multiple languages
in a runtime environment.</p>
<p>I'm not sure what the right strategy is.  I'm not very drawn to
IronPython, though maybe in time that will change.  Out of laziness
alone I'm not inclined to figure out the installation and version
issues of running IronPython with Mono, and since I don't use Windows
that's the only way I'd use IronPython.</p>
<p>But I'm also not that enchanted with multi-language runtimes.  It's
nice, but complex, and I seldom find myself wishing that I could use
<em>more</em> complex systems.  IronPython opens up a whole new world of
complex (.NET) systems to me as a Python programmer.  Which isn't what
I was looking for.  Now maybe a .NET user will now be able to use a
simpler Python environment, but that isn't me.</p>
<p>But what about <a class="reference" href="http://www.parrotcode.org/">Parrot</a> or <a class="reference" href="http://hlvm.org/">HLVM</a>?  These are (or rather <em>want to be</em>) cross-language
environments for dynamic languages, and could introduce an environment
that is more interesting to me than .NET (or the similarly uninteresting JVM).  Python people are always
saying that they wish they could have CPAN.  I should qualify that <em>I</em>
am not always saying that I wish I had CPAN, but maybe those other
people have some point.</p>
<p>But seriously?  I'm just going to go to CPAN and pick out a nice
module and start using it, just pretending it is a normal Python
module?  Is it just me, or does that sound absurd?  I'm sure there's
good things in CPAN, but I <em>really</em> am not looking for more complexity
in my life, and that's all I see down that path.</p>
<p>It occurs to me that there's a different method of interoperation, but
one that isn't being pursued.  I've had a passing interest in Erlang,
and came upon <a class="reference" href="http://www.defmacro.org/ramblings/concurrency.html">this article</a> recently, which
describes the Erlang concurrency model in a fairly simple way (and
using only Java-ish code, no mention of functional programming or any of that).</p>
<p>Erlang processes generally communicate with other Erlang processes in
a homogeneous environment (note: Erlang processes are not OS-level
processes).  But each process doesn't know a lot about other
processes.  There's no reason they all have to be written in the same
language.</p>
<p>You avoid a lot of hard issues this way.  You don't share data.  Are
strings mutable or immutable in your language?  It doesn't really matter -- since you
never share strings (or anything else).  What does the object model
or inheritance look like between languages?  It doesn't really matter, since you don't really share
objects.  Private, public, protected?  Doesn't matter.  Things
actually become <em>less</em> complex, not more complex.</p>
<p>You could do this now with OS processes and sockets, but most language
runtimes aren't set up to deal with this kind of process model very
well.  Processes should be <em>really</em> light, lighter than any OS
process or thread.  It would be really helpful to have shared memory
with copy-on-write, so that you don't <em>actually</em> have to duplicate all
the data sent in messages.  And there needs to be a common message
format, plus library support in each language.</p>
<p>I'm not sure what all the implications of such a system would be.  But
I'm pretty sure it's a system that would actually be attractive to me -- not in a
theoretical isn't-it-nice-that-exists sense (which is the only
attraction I have to IronPython), but in a I-want-to-use-that sense.
I don't want more options and more features; <em>more</em> is tiresome, I'm
really just interested in <em>better</em>.</p>

<p>Erlang nodes actually don't have to be written in Erlang, they just need to speak the protocol. There are implementations of that protocol in (at least) C, Java, .NET and Python.</p>
<p>Technically, some data amongst processes in a given Erlang node can be shared, but that's an implementation detail (and all types in Erlang are immutable anyway). Erlang is a great little language, I've been playing with it for a few weeks... definitely worth trying at least once.</p>

<p>I have had similar thoughts over the past few months.  After playing around with Erlang, I simply cannot understand why you would handle concurrency any other way!  Its such a joy compared to most of the alternatives, and I would absolutely love it if Python 2.6 or Python 3000 included a similar method of handling concurrency, and used Erlang's message passing format as well.  I am actually very surprised that no one has mentioned something like this on the Python 3000 mailing lists yet... although I am not sure that Guido would buy into it.</p>

<p>IronPython is cool for a few reasons, but probably none that are relevant to you. The only way that it is relevant, is that hopefully more people will be using Python. :-)</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>IronPython brings the power of dynamic introspection of live objects (etc) to .NET programmers</li>
<li>It's easy for .NET programmers to embed Python as a scripting language into their applications (very easy generally)</li>
<li>It is <em>much</em> easier (like much easier) to extend IronPython from C# than it is to extend CPython from C</li>
<li>The .NET framework is actually quite cool to program with. If you are programming for Windows and want a native looking GUI, there isn't a comparable choice.</li>
</ul>
<p>Using Perl modules from Python on a common runtime sounds truly excruciating. I <em>would</em> like to cut my teeth on writing a simple compiler, by developing a static extension language for Python using .NET and / or HLVM. Probably won't ever happen though... :-(</p>

<p>Hmmm... and another thing. I guess it is fairly obvious that the future lies in more CPU cores and more distributed processing.</p>
<p>This means that the whole concurrency thing has to be adressed by Python <em>sometime</em>, although that will be evolutionary I guess. It looks like the Erlang model is pretty cool. If my understanding is correct (which is unlikely), Erlang runs effectively as a 'process server' with lots of these inter-communicating 'processes'. Does the server run as a single OS process ? (So if you core dump <em>everything dies</em>, such is life.)</p>

<p>Yep, an Erlang &quot;process&quot; is internal to the Erlang runtime, or &quot;Node&quot;, which runs as a single OS process. You can run as many Nodes as you like though on the same machine or on different machines and then have them talk to each other. At that point, the message passing between Erlang processes is transparent. If you send a message to another process, you don't need to know what Node the process is running on; the runtime takes care of all that. So you typically achieve fault-tolerance by running multiple Nodes on multiple physically seperate machines and use some of Erlang's supervision and monitoring functionality to recover gracefully if a Node manages to crash. An Erlang Node crashing would probably happen more from hardware failure than a core dump though since it's been pretty thoroughly battle-tested and Erlang doesn't really let you do stupid things like pointer manipulation.</p>

<p>My reading on Erlang, and Joe Armstrong's thesis in particular was definitely a factor in getting me into the whole &quot;small REST applications&quot; mindset.</p>
<p>I've also spent a bit of time thinking about the parallels between Erlang's runtime and REST in general. I'm not sure I'd go as far as saying that the <a class="reference" href="http://microapps.org/">microapps</a> stuff I've been doing was directly influenced by Erlang's design, but it definitely helped convince me that it was the right direction to be heading.  Nothing's going to be quite as smooth as message passing within an Erlang runtime, but HTTP is similar in that it's independent of the language, allows for network transparency (nodes can be on the same machine or across an oceaon) and the JSON dicts that usually get sent around are looking an awful lot like Erlang tuples. If you think of a URL as something akin to an Erlang Pid, it gets really interesting.</p>
<p>The way that I've been composing microapps involves making requests asynchronously whenever possible and using a message queue app and event notification app. I guess to follow the Erlang model as closely as possible, we would want to avoid using GET. Instead, the client would POST a message onto the queue saying &quot;I'd like you to send this piece of data to this URL&quot;, the event notification app would notify the server that there's been a new message added to its queue, which it would retrieve, process, and then POST to the client application's queue a response with the data requested and the client would get an event notification of an item added to its queue and go get it. It's an interesting approach and I've been playing with it for some apps that the latency doesn't matter as much. But for most stuff, synchronous GET requests are so much simpler and easier that it's worth blocking for them.</p>

<p>My own lack of interest in IronPython stems from a more fundamental objection: The main advantage to using IronPython to develop and deploy Python programs on Windows (instead of CPython) is the easy access to various .NET libraries.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, many of these libraries have licenses that preclude licensing a consuming app under the GPL (for which there may be very good business reasons). Without the ability to license my apps under the license of my choice, both any interest in using those libraries, and hence, any interest in using IronPython instead of CPython goes away.</p>
