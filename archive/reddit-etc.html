            </p>
            <p>
                One thing that comes up often in these discussions is a
                dismissiveness towards something you feel you can reimplement
                yourself. This actually appears in a whole set of cases here --
                reddit reimplementing their site, webpy implementing another
                framework, the Lispers impression that they could reimplement
                any Python library if it was so important (or that they could
                just reimplement reddit entirely), and so forth. Sometimes
                reimplementation works; but often you don't realize the true
                scope of what is implemented so far, or you ignore the
                opportunity cost (you are coding to produce no advances, instead
                moving forward), or you ignore the fact that the thing you are
                reimplementing may itself be advancing even as you reimplement
                it. I don't have any new thoughts on this, really, but it's
                interesting to see so <em>many</em> kinds of reimplementation in
                the same discussion.
            </p>
            <p>
                Anyway,
                <a
                    class="reference"
                    href="http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/rewritingreddit"
                    >Aaron Swartz</a
                >
                talks about the switch as well, and about why he chose (or stuck
                with) webpy instead of Django. One thing he doesn't explicitly
                say, which I think is an important criteria, is that Django's
                best features (its CMS-ish features) probably have no relevance
                to either reddit or Aaron's project. So Django's features are
                just baggage in that context. In particular, they are both
                working on just one application; they don't need to push out
                lots of apps, they probably aren't working with many (any?)
                designers, and they want to optimize some very specific aspects
                of their application that they consider the competitive parts.
            </p>
            <p>
                Another aspect is that they probably don't mind a little legwork
                to implement each form, if it means they can tweak that form
                arbitrarily. Since I believe exceptional UI is only possible if
                you diverge from the rules, I'd agree with them.
                <em>Good</em> UI doesn't necessarily require that, and when you
                are looking for quantity instead of quality, a framework can be
                very useful. Better the rule-driven good form a framework gives,
                then the crappy form you write yourself which you don't have
                time to improve.
            </p>
            <p>
                Another thing that complicates Django -- and many other
                frameworks -- is configuration. When Aaron mentions that you
                have to use their console and environment, it's because of
                configuration. I personally haven't figured out the right way to
                do configuration. I suspect the webpy answer to that is to
                hardcode many things, or use ad hoc techniques to identify your
                environment. That works when you are maintaining one app in a
                small number of environments. But even if it isn't important for
                them, configuration is important for most people; if all webpy
                does is avoid the issue I think they've oversimplified the
                system.
            </p>
            <p>
                Aaron also says that he doesn't think there's any framework that
                matches the simplicity of webpy. Well, I'll bite and offer up
                <a class="reference" href="http://pythonpaste.org/wareweb/"
                    >Wareweb</a
                >. Since I've finally gotten a chance to use it some more,
                though only on small apps, I'm feeling a little more confident
                about it. I still might remove some parts and add some parts --
                I've been thinking about REST-like dispatching (but definitely
                not as strict as webpy seems to be), and I think the generalized
                event system in Wareweb isn't really necessary. The URL
                dispatching webpy uses could be applied easily enough. But
                enough apologies, those suck. Wareweb is:
            </p>
            <ul class="simple">
                <li>Really simple.</li>
                <li>
                    Extensible (extension is required if you want to integrate
                    with a particular templating language, but it shouldn't be
                    hard).
                </li>
                <li>Flat with respect to WSGI, which means...</li>
                <li>
                    Easy to integrate with code that Doesn't Fit Into
                    Frameworks.
                </li>
                <li>Environment neutral; you can embed it anywhere.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                So if you find yourself looking for a simple web framework, I
                would definitely suggest looking at Wareweb.

                    So followed this link ... the page it leads to offers no
                    help whatsoever in understanding how Wareweb works. It
                    rather scares me away with seemingly overcomplicated

                    <p>
                        I suppose the page doesn't really say how to start,
                        though if you are familiar with servlets (which
                        themselves aren't particularly complicated) then it
                        should seem somewhat familiar. OTOH, I am
                        <em>not</em> saying that you should use this instead of
                        a full-stack system, and I'm not offering it up as an
                        alternative to Django, and if you need guidance in
                        application design this probably isn't the framework for
                        you. Wareweb is a simple and predictable core, but it's
                        only part of a full stack.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I could point you to the
                        <a
                            class="reference"
                            href="http://svn.pythonpaste.org/Paste/apps/Commentary/trunk/commentary/web/"
                            >Commentary application</a
                        >
                        I wrote, but I'm not sure it's going to help. And the
                        <a
                            class="reference"
                            href="http://svn.pythonpaste.org/Paste/apps/FileBrowser/trunk/"
                            >Filebrowser app</a
                        >
                        also uses it, but similarly it is a little funny and
                        minimal (though at least it uses templates, where the
                        Commentary application is so light on HTML that I opted
                        not to use templates).
