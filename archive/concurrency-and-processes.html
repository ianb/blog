</div><h1>Concurrency and Processes</h1>
 
<div class="document">
<p>For a long time when people criticize threads, my feeling has been
that (a) they have a point, but (b) threads aren't as hard as they
imply because (c) concurrency is always hard, but mostly (d) thread
critics need to provide better tools for concurrency.  I know how to
use threads, and I'm relatively happy with them; I'm quite willing to
look at alternatives, but I don't feel I'm being given very good
alternatives.  Convince me with carrots instead of sticks.  An
especially poor argument is one that tells me that I'm currently being
beaten with a stick, but apparently don't know it.  For people who
think threads aren't a reasonable option for concurrency in Python:
you are simply wrong, lots of people are successfully using threads
for concurrency, and arguments to the contrary are simply delusional.</p>
<p>The Twisted people have tried to provide alternative tools, and they
certainly put their hearts into it, but I just don't think their style
of asynchronous programming is straight-forward enough for the bulk of
programmers.  It doesn't provide the gradual learning curve that I
value in Python (regardless of where I personally am on that learning
curve).  It certainly looks like Python 2.5 will improve things, but I
don't think the style really elucidates the issues of concurrent
programming particularly well.  Concurrent programming introduces
inevitable challenges; a good model guides the programmer, it can't
solve the problems on its own.</p>
<p>The other alternative -- multi-process -- in Python is common enough,
but feels very ad hoc to me.  There aren't good tools for sharing data
and communication (or if there are they aren't well enough
publicized).  Nor are there good tools for handling multiple processes
in a cross-platform way.  I don't use Windows, but I'm not willing to
abandon Windows users by <em>relying</em> on fork.  (That doesn't mean we
can't use fork, just that we can't <em>only</em> use fork.)</p>
<p>But, it seems that there might be some progress.  I came upon <a class="reference" href="http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/wlg/8002">this
post</a> by Jeremy Jones about
concurrency, which led me to <a class="reference" href="http://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-dev/2005-September/056829.html">this proposal</a>
by <a class="reference" href="http://hathawaymix.org/">Shane Hathaway</a> and <a class="reference" href="http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.python.devel/71708">this Py-Dev thread</a>.</p>
<p>The discussion seems to have stopped, which is too bad.  I hope it
starts back up again.</p>

<p>Queuing in a filesystem?  The proper locking is also a little confusing, at least if you want to do it cross platform.  Filesystem events?  I have no idea how that works; in theory there are ways of efficiently detecting changes to files, but there's no unified cross-platform way to do it (and even single platforms have multiple ways to do it).  Sure, the filesystem could (maybe) provide infrastructure for these things, but we would still need better tools.</p>

<p>These days, when people talk multi-core CPUs and massively-parallel anything, my first question is always, &quot;OK, show me the debugger.&quot;  (The greatest thing about the Linda (tuple space) model of concurrency was how easy it was to debug --- I never found anything else that even came close.)</p>

 I've been using Twisted for about two years now, and I have to agree: Twisted is not easy to use. The other problem I have in using Twisted is that you have to use it for everything -- any kind of blocking call in the standard library is out of the question unless you wrap it in a thread. It's just always extremely clear, that in Twisted, you aren't using Python as it was intended.<br /><br />Having said that, noting that the scalability of a Twisted server verses that of a threaded or forking one (developed in Python) speaks for itself. You <span style="font-style: italic;">can</span> manage concurrency with threads in Python, but it just can't compare to the asynchronous framework. I don't know what kind of work you do, but in working on systems that have hundreds of chat network sessions open, Twisted's ugly but it does the job.<br /><br />I'd like to get to know more about Ruby's microthreading model -- it looks a lot like what Twisted does, but as part of the language.<br />

<p>The one thing I'm sure of, twisted is a great idea with a horrible implementation.  If they would implement something along the lines of ACE, things would be better.  Heck, just embracing more established design patterns would be a good thing...and in the end, that's the only area I can give high marks to twisted.</p>

<p>I have the same opinion about the Twisted - being enthusiastic at the beginning, I have invested some time in it, but now I'm a bit disappointed. It's just not how a program must flow - inside out, throwing in countless microcallbacks and keeping state variables. I'm not unfamiliar with the asynchronous model, but it have very restricted use.</p>
<p>More, the Twisted is in very raw state yet. For example, it's a shame that there is no good http client in the network toolkit. But worse, you cannot use the httplib from the standard Python distribution - it is, naturally, totally unusable with the Twisted, and this is a common problem with asyncronous model.</p>
<p>After all, if your application is simple, you'll have no problem with threads, but if it's complicated, you'll get troubles with the Twisted as well, no less than with the threads model.</p>

<p>It's a good idea to try to find a concurrency model at a higher level of abstraction than locks and semaphores that fits the desired semantics and behaviour of your program, and use that to manage the interactions between threads.</p>
<p>I wrote some Python code implementing a number of useful concurrency primitives - multiqueues, reader-writer locks, active objects, dataflow variables and so on. It's available as part of the Tripoli triple space source code:</p>

<p>Incidentally, my own comments on (inter alia) Twisted's programming model and threads are here:</p>

<p>Unsurprisingly this little rant annoyed some Twisted people mightily; but Glyph's reply, in the comments on the post, is both polite and pertinent.</p>

<p>I'm a programming newbie in most respects, and have always programmed small programs in a single thread. But I'm interested in concurrent programming and have been very interested in the various generator-based approaches. Perhaps someone should write an article on: 1. The advantages/disadvantages between true threads and the microthread approach (i.e. like the Nanothread module from the LGT project), and 2. A list of the different microthread modules out there and their limitations. From a newbie point of view, the microthread approach seems like a holy grail (i.e. speed; deterministic results avoiding race conditions, etc.), but maybe I just don't understand what it can't do.</p>
