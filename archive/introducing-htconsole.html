                    >HTConsole</a
                >. (Like several people now, I am lazily using the Cheese Shop
                page as the homepage.) (I should note also, I'm not really
                trying to recreate the publically-available interpreter aspect
                of Try Ruby, it's more that I'm trying to further explore the
                HTML-based interpreter that the later parts of the Try Ruby
                tutorial introduces)
            </p>
            <p>
                This isn't intended to be Yet Another Python Console; I'm really
                thinking more about this as a learning tool. And since I haven't
                really thought about the security implications, you'll have to
                install it yourself to try it. Maybe some of
                <a
                    class="reference"
                    href="http://www.mired.org/home/mwm/try_python/"
                    >this</a
                >
                later.
            </p>
            <p>
                But really, the idea isn't to duplicate (or even improve ala
                <a class="reference" href="http://ipython.scipy.org/">ipython</a
                >) the console experience (ignoring the name), except to use
                that as a starting point.
            </p>
            <p>
                So far I've mostly just achieved that starting point, but if you
                poke around there's a couple places where I'm expanding on that.
                If you add something to the local scope (e.g., through an import
                or assignment), it shows up in a table at the bottom of the
                screen. (Though I'm going to have to figure out how to keep the
                screen from getting too long.) Objects can also be displayed in
                an interactive manner. A function, for instance, has an edit
                button; if you hit it, you can edit the function in place. I
                want to add self-editing features to more objects. Well, at
                least to classes and functions. And dicts. And lists too I
                guess. And
                <tt class="docutils literal"
                    ><span class="pre">property</span></tt
                >. So, okay, a bunch of things.
            </p>
            <p>
                On edu-sig there's also been talk of doctesting, and that's
                another thing I want to add, just to select a doctest and run it
                against the environment.
            </p>
            <p>
                Anyway, it's kind of fun I think, and thoroughly non-enterprise;
                not even suitable for serious programming. That lends a sense of
                freedom. You install it like:
            </p>
            <pre class="literal-block">
easy_install htconsole
... lots of junk passes by ...
htconsole
... web browser pops up with console ...
</pre
            >
            <p>
                At least, I think this is all it should take to install.
                <strong>Note:</strong> I'm pretty sure you'll need the latest
                version of setuptools to get it to install nicely (with support
                for
                <tt class="docutils literal"
                    ><span class="pre">dependency_links</span></tt
                >) -- grab
                <a
                    class="reference"
                    href="http://peak.telecommunity.com/dist/ez_setup.py"
                    >ez_setup.py</a
                >
                and run it to get the latest version.
            </p>
            <p>
                Now to figure out some of the tricky Python magic to edit more
                objects in place...

                    How come you wrote your own serializeJSON, when MochiKit

                    The keyboard handling code would be a lot cleaner and more
                    correct if you used the MochiKit.Signal API. Check the
                    latest interpreter example sources.

                <p>
                    It's also kind of weird that you're using the exported
                    functions for base and async stuff, but fully qualified DOM
                    functions. I'd pick one or the other style and stick to it.

                    Could definitely use a status indicator and a way to
                    interrupt.. I guess via some kind of trace func of a C
                    extension to send exceptions across threads.

                        Because I could not find it. I have a really hard time

                        I haven't particularly noticed that, but then there's
                        lots of conditions I haven't tried. Was there a
                        particular thing you were doing that caused a problem
                        (something I might be able to reproduce)?

                            How can the MochiKit docs change such that you'd
                            have an easier time finding things? I mean shit, if
                            you had looked for a function named serializeJSON
                            you'd have found it... you picked the same name I

                                Huh, yeah it's right in Base. I guess I have a
                                problem figuring out what module things are in
                                -- specifically Base, Format, and Async, though
                                Base and Iter are also hard to tell apart at
                                times. Now that I look at it, I realize I could
                                just expand all the function lists on the front
                                page of the documentation; instead I kept
                                looking on individual pages. Maybe an
                                &quot;expand list of all available
                                functions&quot; link on the front page would

                                runaway thread is hard. Certainly on the client
                                side some indication of
                                command-sent-waiting-for-response can be added
                                easily enough, but unfortunately I don't know
                                how to actually handle the problem of infinite
                                loops.

                                    There are two ways to handle an infinite
                                    loop.. you can set a trace func that checks
                                    some variable to see if it should raise an
                                    exception or not, or you can hack into some
                                    semi-private C API which lets you send an
                                    exception to another thread. The former is
                                    probably better for this.

                                A single page with the entire documentation
                                would also help (easier to search). On the topic
                                of docs, links to the implementations from the
                                documentation would also be really nice; the
                                docs can be a little terse at times, but usually
                                the implementation is clear enough.

                                    I'd rather fix the doc bugs than try and
                                    link to the source from the docs
                                    (non-trivial). Please file tickets when you
                                    find documentation that is insufficient.
