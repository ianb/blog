        <h1>WSGI WebKit</h1>
        <p>
            I spent some time and got a good start on implemented
            <a href="http://webwareforpython.org">Webware</a> (the WebKit
            portion) for
            <a href="http://www.python.org/peps/pep-0333.html">WSGI</a>. It's
            missing a number of things, but it works for a basic servlet.
        </p>

        <p>
            I'm excited about this, because I've been feeling frustrated with
            Webware for the last year or two. I felt like enhancements weren't
            really helping -- no one would use them, and I was only making it
            harder to do gradual Webware development. At the same time, the
            whole thing felt way too coupled, and it was hard to test or feel
            confident about changes.
        </p>

        <p>
            I had considered various ways to improve Webware more incrementally,
            with an eye to decoupling.
            <a
                href="http://cvs.sourceforge.net/viewcvs.py/*checkout*/webware-sandbox/Sandbox/ianbicking/WebKit/README.html?rev=1.1"
                >Standalone WebKit</a
            >
            (in
            <a
                href="http://cvs.sourceforge.net/viewcvs.py/webware-sandbox/Sandbox/ianbicking/WebKit/"
                >CVS</a
            >) was one idea. It broke off a big chunk of Webware (WebKit), and
            cleaned up some portions (mostly configuration and installation).
            But there was a lot left. I could redo the entire thing, but I
            wasn't so in love with the Webware interfaces that I'd want to
            reimplement something that was entirely compatible. Yet backward
            compatibility (at least without major application modifications) was
            important to me.
        </p>

        <p>
            Enter WSGI. I wrote before
            <a
                href="http://blog.colorstudy.com/ianb/weblog/2004/08/22.html#P150"
                >about a WSGI stack</a
            >
            that would break WebKit into smaller, reusable chunks. Mostly by
            fidding with <tt>Transaction</tt>, <tt>HTTPRequest</tt>, and
            <tt>HTTPResponse</tt> I can get Webware working, with a small
            addition to <tt>Servlet</tt> as well. It's in
            <tt>svn://colorstudy.com/trunk/WSGI/</tt> in
            <tt>WSGIWebKit</tt> (also viewable via
            <a href="http://colorstudy.com/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/trunk/WSGI/"
                >viewcvs</a
            >, but that can be flaky; install Subversion!) It ended up being
            easier than I expected. The servlets themselves become
            <a
                href="http://www.python.org/peps/pep-0333.html#the-application-framework-side"
                >WSGI applications</a
            >, which is cool; I can imagine WebKit servlets living side-by-side
            with a Quixote script, Spyce pages, etc. Not just peacefully
            coexisting, but as complete peers.
        </p>

        <p>
            There's still probably quite a few bits of the WebKit API (informal
            though it is) that I'm missing, and some larger features (like
            sessions and a persistent, threaded appserver). I'm hoping to handle
            some of these features in a layered way, maybe using other people's
            work instead of implementing it myself. I feel optimistic about
            reusing code across projects.
        </p>

        <p>
            It would be great if someone had a significant Webware application
            that also had good functional/system/acceptance tests; it would be a
            way to flesh out much of the API, and could provide a migration
            model (complete, seamless backward compatibility isn't my initial
            goal). Anyone? (No, I'm afraid I've never done complete automated
            system tests on any of my applications.)
        </p>

        <p>
            In other WSGI news, the spec seems close to 1.0. I think Phillip
            wants to write some reference code as part of the spec, and there's
            still some asynchronous issues that haven't been resolved.

            That's a good news. I've read the WSGI draft and perceive this as a
            next major step in maturing of Pythonic web platform. I was also a
            bit frustrated with WebKit as I feel "this could be done cleaner".
            While I doubt I could made any significant contribution to your
            efforts I wish you a good luck!

            Personally, for my latest project, I abstracted the portion of
            WebKit's API I actually use into a facade class to decouple
            application code as much from WebKit as possible.

            You seem to have some url problems eg

            gives a 404.
            <br />

            Anyway this is good news.

            While browsing the SVN, i really understand how WSGI can be used
            with the Webware API. But i'm wondering how to do the same w/
            mod_python + apache
            <br />

            <br />
            Someone has a URL ?
            <br />

            <br />
            Bye Bye

            mod_python should be a fairly easy server to implement. WSGI would
            probably be a handler, similar to the publisher handler. Code
            written <i>for</i> mod_python is another matter. I don't think
            there's any way to support that, because you'd essentially have to
            recreate an apache-like environment without using Apache. Hopefully
            anyone who has programmed directly to the mod_python API realizes
            they have eschewed any portability; though many frameworks built on
            top of mod_python could be ported to WSGI, since most of those don't
            really use many mod_python-specific features.
