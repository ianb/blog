        <h1>A Python Poka-Yoke</h1>

        <div class="document">
            <p>
                A while ago I read about
                <a
                    class="reference"
                    href="http://www.campbell.berry.edu/faculty/jgrout/pokasoft.html"
                    >Poka-Yoke</a
                >, a Japanese quality assurance technique. To me it really seems
                like attention to the small processes we go through in
                performing our tasks; an example:
            </p>
            <ul class="simple">
                <li>
                    In the old method, a worker began by taking two springs out
                    of a large parts box and then assembled a switch.
                </li>
                <li>
                    In the new approach, a small dish is placed in front of the
                    parts box and the worker's first task is to take two springs
                    out of the box and place them on the dish. Then the worker
                    assembles the switch. If any spring remains on the dish,
                    then the worker knows that he or she has forgotten to insert
                    it.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                This kind of attention to detail in manufacturing obviously
                applies very much to software development as well, where small
                defects can cause difficult bugs.
                <a
                    class="reference"
                    href="http://homepage.mac.com/keithray/blog/2003/11/15/#MorePokayoke"
                    >Keith Ray also writes about this</a
                >.
            </p>
            <p>
                An obvious Poka-Yoke for Python is
                <a class="reference" href="http://pychecker.sf.net">PyChecker</a
                >, which checks Python source for many common problems. But I
                find the most important Python Poke-Yokes are the ones built
                right into the languages. Exceptions are our defect detection
                mechanisms, moreso than analysis. Prevention is done in a more
                ad hoc manner.
            </p>
            <p>
                My little Poke-Yoke: don't use default arguments. It's tempting
                to find a sort of &quot;preferred&quot; value for an argument,
                or a trivial value, and use that as a default. For instance,
                every boolean input can probably be thought of in terms of a
                default and non-default input. This especially becomes tempting
                when you have a large number of inputs to a function, as with
                some constructors.
            </p>
            <p>
                But what seems to be the obvious default value when writing the
                function isn't necessarily obvious when reading the function
                invocation. Even worse, the reader may not even recognize that
                the default exists.
            </p>
            <p>
                More importantly, though, is that you not cover up complexity.
                Given a long, complicated function signature, when you use that
                function you need to look up the signature, and understand all
                the arguments. You should explicitly and consciously choose
                values for all the arguments. If you do not do so, you'll get an
                exception -- problem detected. With default arguments, you may
                miss something unintentionally but have your mistake
                &quot;fixed&quot; by the default value. But the default can't
                think for you, and it can't make the context-sensitive decision
                about the appropriate value for that argument.
            </p>
            <p>
                This should not be confused with an indictment of keyword
                arguments -- quite the contrary, in fact. Keyword arguments are
                another Poka-Yoke, that protect you against misremembering the
                order of arguments, or having that order changed. They also mean
                that the values are tightly bound to the argument names, which
                are indicative of semantics -- change the semantics, then change
                the argument names, then change all function invocations. You
                don't need default values to use keyword arguments, so you can
                use keywords copiously, and almost always increase readability
                in the process.
            </p>
            <p>
                Of course, these aren't hard rules. But in the right context
                these can save you some problems -- or maybe just make you
                immediately aware of the problems.
            </p>

            Occasionally you find you need to change the declaration of a
            function to add a small amount of additional functionality which is
            only needed by a few callers of the function. Default values can
            allow you to make the change without having to modify all callers
            *at the same time*. This is especially important if the functions
            you need to change are part of a published interface.

            A better way to accomplish the same thing is to:
            <br />

            <br />
            1. Create a new function that takes the new parameters you need.
            <br />
            2. Move the implementation of the existing function into the new
            function.
            <br />
            3. Change the original function to call the new function with the
            correct "default" parameters.
            <br />

            <br />
            This lets the users of the older version still use it without
            changing, and still provides the extended functionality. Moreover,
            having two separate APIs makes a potential user think about which
            version he wants before calling. Naturally, this can be taken to
            unhealthy extremes, but it's usually safer than having a pile of
            assumptions in default parameters.

            Yeah. And after some years you end up with the Windows API, where
            you are lost in a maze of twisty little functions, all alike ..
            <br />

            I guess I should say that I think things like this should really be
            used when you are writing something error-prone -- something that is
            complex and easily misused. It's not even something I'd consider a
            "rule". I often use default arguments, and changing APIs is a
            frequent reason. This is more a suggestion that we be a bit
            reluctant in using default arguments, not that we go so far as to
            avoid them.
