                I was just looking at
                <a
                    class="reference"
                    href="http://manuals.rubyonrails.com/read/chapter/28"
                    >Rails' functional testing</a
                >. Here's their first example:
            </p>
            <pre class="literal-block">
require File.dirname(__FILE__) + '/../test_helper'

# grab our HomeController because we're going to test it
require 'home_controller'

# Raise errors beyond the default web-based presentation
class HomeController; def rescue_action(e) raise e end; end

class HomeControllerTest &lt; Test::Unit::TestCase
  def setup
    &#64;controller = HomeController.new
    &#64;request = ActionController::TestRequest.new
    &#64;response = ActionController::TestResponse.new
  end

  # let's test our main index page
  def test_index
    get :index
    assert_response :success
  end
end
</pre
            >
            <p>
                Here's how you'd
                <a
                    class="reference"
                    href="http://pythonpaste.org/docs/testing-applications.html"
                    >do it in Paste</a
                >:
            </p>
            <pre class="literal-block">
from paste.tests.fixture import *

def test_index():
    res = app.get('/')
</pre
            >
            <p>(Note: 100% framework neutral!)</p>
            <p>
                Why is it so much shorter? Well, first it uses
                <a
                    class="reference"
                    href="http://codespeak.net/py/current/doc/test.html"
                    >py.test</a
                >
                instead of an XUnit-based system, which gets rid of the stupid
                cruft of XUnit. This isn't a criticism of Rails or Ruby, per se
                -- we have
                <a
                    class="reference"
                    href="http://python.org/doc/current/lib/module-unittest.html"
                    >the same module</a
                >
                in Python and it's no better. py.test <strong>is</strong> much
                better, though.
            </p>
            <p>
                Second, setup is done in
                <tt class="docutils literal"
                    ><span class="pre"
                        >paste.tests.fixture.setup_module</span
                    ></tt
                >, which is a special function that py.test calls (and you
                imported with
                <tt class="docutils literal"
                    ><span class="pre">import</span>
                    <span class="pre">*</span></tt
                >). This finds your configuration file and creates your WSGI
                application. This part (finding a configuration file and using
                that to construct an application) is Paste-specific, but
                everything else sticks to
                <a
                    class="reference"
                    href="http://www.python.org/peps/pep-0333.html"
                    >WSGI</a
                >. This also puts
                <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">app</span></tt>
                (an object intended for testing) in the module's namespace.
            </p>
            <p>
                Lastly, this object assumes when you say
                <tt class="docutils literal"
                    ><span class="pre">app.get('/')</span></tt
                >
                that you expect everything to work. That means a
                <tt class="docutils literal"
                    ><span class="pre">200</span>
                    <span class="pre">OK</span></tt
                >
                response (as well as a couple other checks -- redirects are also
                okay). You have to specifically indicate that you expect another
                response; since this is an object intended for testing, why not
                build test-friendly assumptions into it?
            </p>
            <p>
                Looking through the Rails docs on this, there's some other
                useful features I'd like to add. Because this only uses opaque
                WSGI applications, you can't look at the variables used to
                render the document; the only communication you get is the
                actual textual response. Here's what I frequently do:
            </p>
            <pre class="literal-block">
def test_index():
    res = app.get('/')
    for item in db.TodoItem.select():
        res.mustcontain(item.title)
</pre
            >
            <p>
                I'm not actually that interested in how the view got the items,
                so looking at the communication between view and controller
                isn't that interesting. But I can imagine adding some convention
                so that frameworks (when run in testing mode) could stuff
                objects into the WSGI environment for later inspection.
            </p>
            <p>
                One of the things I like about Paste's tests compared to tests
                that are more opaque (e.g., actually speak to the app over HTTP)
                is that I have access to the backend objects (like
                <tt class="docutils literal"
                    ><span class="pre">db.TodoItem</span></tt
                >), and exceptions propogate (which gives me py.test's fancy
                tracebacks). As a result I've become less excited about the
                functional testing provided by
                <a
                    class="reference"
                    href="http://www.idyll.org/~t/www-tools/twill.html"
                    >Twill</a
                >
                and others.
            </p>
            <p>
                The whole thing is fairly young, but I think it is pleasantly
                simple and yet quite useful. If you are interested look at the

                    I'd be nice to see examples of the test failures. As you
                    say, the fancy tracebacks. These are often one of the hidden
                    beauties of testing frameworks.

                <p>Where does app come from?</p>
                <p>
                    From looking at the test I can't tell where app comes from.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I suppose it could be a good thing to write generic tests
                    for multiple applications.
                </p>
                <p>Perhaps explicitly tell it where the config file is?</p>
                <p>
                    However what is in this config file? If I was writing this
                    test from scratch I'd need to know the config file format,
                    and what needs to go in it.

                    Importing your app module directly might be the go to make
                    it more explicit?

                        The configuration is a Paste configuration file, which
                        describes an application. The configuration file is

                        Generally this should work easily if you have your
                        application set up to run in Paste. But not so easy
                        otherwise. Hrm... and I don't think I really have good
                        documentation for the configuration file at this time :(
