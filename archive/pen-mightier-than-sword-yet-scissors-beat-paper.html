            Jim Waldo talks about the classic
            <a href="http://www.dreamsongs.com/WorseIsBetter.html"
                ><i>Worse is Better</i></a
            >
            in
            <a href="http://www.artima.com/weblogs/viewpost.jsp?thread=24807"
                >Worse is Worse</a
            >.
        </p>
        <p>
            Really what it comes down to is: if you think worse is better, then
            you don't know what the hell you're talking about. You don't
            understand &quot;worse&quot;, or &quot;better&quot;, or maybe you
            think &quot;better&quot; means popular, while &quot;worse&quot;
            means simpler (or does &quot;worse&quot; mean unpopular and
            &quot;better&quot; mean complex? Or does &quot;better&quot; mean
            pretty and &quot;worse&quot; mean disfunctional? Or does
            &quot;better&quot; mean reliable, and &quot;worse&quot; mean
            unprofitable?).. anyway, it's just a semantic mess.

            Which isn't the original author's fault, he was just using a catchy
            title. It's good he did, because now we can refer to that entire
            line of thought with those three words. It's bad because some dumb
            people confuse truisms for truth. But those people are dumb, and can
            be discounted, so I don't know why I should worry about it anyway.

            ~spits~ Yep, them there kind'a peoples is dumb. But they have money,
            and want to spend it on us. I mean, the "solution".

            I prefer the simple but elegant philosophy, which simplifies layout
            but complicates interaction, in layers. I guess that would be the
            "So-so is better". Or maybe "Fast but confusing". What are the rules
            for the 3 word catch phrase, anyways?

            Actually, with his later commentary (eg. the Acceptance Models
            paper), Gabriel seems to be aware that "worse" is really a
            combination of seemingly counter-intuitive disruptive factors,
            rather than supposedly sloppy UNIX-style programming attitudes.
