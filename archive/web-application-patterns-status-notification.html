            Here's a little pattern I use quite often in web applications. Like
            a lot of patterns, it's not tied to any particular environment, or
            even to any specific application. There's a lot of these kinds of
            patterns out there that are specific to web applications (in
            addition to the
            <a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?DesignPatterns">standard patterns</a
            >), but they don't seem to be well collected, defined, or named...
        </p>
        <p>
            Frequently you will need to present out-of-context information to
            the user. For instance, in a webmail application when sending an
            email. A page saying &quot;email successfully sent&quot; isn't very
            interesting. Simply redirecting the user to the email index isn't
            very friendly either: it's important to give some feedback when a
            user performs a state-altering action. You want to predict what the
            user is likely to be most interested in, and direct them there, but
            you also want to put some notification about what just happened.
        </p>
        <p>
            In whatever framework I am using (Webware, Zope, PHP), I'll usually
            add something like this to the template header (<a
                href="http://webware.sf.net"
                >Webware</a
            >
            here):
        </p>
        <pre>class SitePage(Page):<br />    ....<br />    def writeMessage(self):<br />        if self.session().value('messages'):<br />            self.write('&lt;div class=&quot;alert&quot;&gt;%s&lt;/div&gt;' %<br />                       '&lt;br&gt;\n'.join(session.value('messages')))<br />            self.session.setValue('messages', [])<br />    def sendMessage(self, msg):<br />        self.session().setValue('messages',<br />            self.session().value('messages', []) + [msg])<br /></pre>

        ... and calling <tt>writeMessage</tt> somewhere in the
        <tt>SitePage</tt> header. In Zope (somewhere in
        <tt>standard_template.pt</tt>):

        <pre>&lt;div tal:condition=&quot;request/SESSION/message | nothing&quot;<br />     style=&quot;border: thin black solid; background-color: #ddddff&quot;&gt;<br />  &lt;tal:block repeat=&quot;msg request/SESSION/message&quot;&gt;<br />    &lt;span tal:replace=&quot;msg&quot; /&gt;&lt;br&gt;<br />  &lt;/tal:block&gt;<br /> &lt;tal:block replace=&quot;python: request.SESSION.set('message', [])&quot; /&gt;<br />&lt;/div&gt;<br /></pre>

        It's important to reset the <tt>messages</tt> session variable only when
        you actually display it, as the user may get redirected before the
        template is rendered (especially if you use redirect after POST --
        another pattern -- which works well with this technique).

        <p>
            If you haven't seen <tt>tal:block</tt> before, any tag prefixed with
            <tt>tal:</tt> gets removed from the final ZPT output, and any
            attributes of that tag are treated as TAL attributes. It saves a bit
            of typing, and anyone using ZPT can use all the help they can get to
            save typing.
        </p>
        <p>
            People sometimes implement this in different ways. For instance,
            they simply invoke the template passing in a message variable. So in
            a webmail application, this might look like:
        </p>
        <pre># send mail action:<br />invalid_message = validate_email(request) # return None if valid<br />if invalid_message:<br />    return sendmail_form(message=invalid_message)<br />sendmail(user.email, request.to, request.subject, request.body)<br />return mail_index(message='Email to %s sent successfully' %<br />                  request.to)<br /></pre>

        Anyone who likes to use the back button knows what a pain this sort of
        application is to use. A common navigation would be to arrive at the
        index page after sending, view an email, and then you want to go back to
        the index (using your back button). But you can't, because that index
        was the result of a POST, and probably isn't cachable. To reload it
        would resend the email. (In contrast: for the invalid case passing in a
        variable works well)

        <p>
            A solution to this is to redirect the user after sending their
            email. There's a few gotchas here relating to exactly what result
            code you use (there's a whole set of
            <a
                href="http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec10.html#sec10.3"
                >3xx</a
            >
            result codes), but that's another topic.
        </p>
        <p>
            People sometimes start passing the messages in GET variables, e.g.
            <tt>redirect('/index?message=Email+sent+successfully')</tt>. This is
            terribly awkard, and it's not worth it to go down this path. Just
            use sessions, which are perfectly suited for this task. The GET
            variable is also flawed because that message is forever tied to that
            page, even after a reload, and even after the message is no longer
            timely.
        </p>
        <p>
            Once you integrate this into your templates, you'll find yourself
            using these messages all the time. You can use it to add quick error
            messages, where before you might have been too lazy, or just have
            used some sort of generic &quot;There was an error, hit the back
            button on your browser and correct it&quot; page. You can notify the
            user of all sorts of little events which you might otherwise simply
            imply (e.g., &quot;item deleted from cart&quot;, &quot;edits
            saved&quot;, and so on). These updates give the user a clear idea of
            what they've done, what they need to do next (because they usually
            are in the middle of some longer set of tasks only they understand),
            and generally that their efforts are successful.

            I very much liked the article.
            <br />

            <br />
            I've started to use 300 codes in my applications so that I can
            preserve the Back button, and so that I can use one set of URLs for
            handling code, before redirecting to the correct page for fetching
            the results.
            <br />

            <br />
            I'm sure that there are many other patterns for web development, one
            that comes to mind is a page which starts a long running search,
            then reloads itself until it completes (like most travel sites).

            You have to be careful in Zope when redirecting and using sessions.
            <br />

            <br />
            If you raise the string 'Redirect' (capital R), it will cause Zope
            to abort the transaction and thus, abort the session write. There
            are cases when this is what you want - going along, coming across a
            problem after some data has already been written, and wanting to
            alert the user to this fact.
            <br />

            <br />
            When you use the redirect method on Zope's RESPONSE object, the
            transaction will commit and the session data will be retained.
            <br />

            <br />
            In cases like this, I've started using my own API calls such as
            'returnWithMessage' which takes, among other parameters, a
            'do_raise' argument. If 'do_raise' is true, the Redirect is raised
            as an error. If false, a regular redirect occurs. I've just added
            smarts into one of those calls to use a new 'page_messenger' service
            I wrote, inspired by your post (it's a bit cleaner than calling
            request.SESSION.set in a template, and has let me retain expections
            from current code that passes the message in via the request or a
            template call option).

            it does not seems to be 'transactions-aware'. I mean if somebody
            will request very fast 2 pages, where 1st returning a error, then
            both of the pages will display same error. may be I am wrong, but it
            seems to be so.
            <br />

            <br />
            personally I prefer to drive template from a script in this case,
            passing variables directly to template. its possible in php,
            webware, and Zope. Last year I am working with Zope, here is example
            in script:
            <br />

            <br />
            errors=[]
            <br />
            if username=='':
            <br />
            errors.append('Please enter your username')
            <br />
            if password=='':
            <br />
            errors.append('Please enter your password')
            <br />

            <br />
            if len(errors)>0:
            <br />
            request.set('errors', eroors)
            <br />
            return getattr(context,'login.html)(container,request)
            <br />

            <br />
            so, in the page template I loop over the error list same way as
            described in the Ian example above.
            <br />

            <br />
            its also more secure, since 3rd party do not see any particular data
            into URL GET requests, so both Session, and this example should be
            good.
            <br />
