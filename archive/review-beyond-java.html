                which I'll use as the starting point for my own reaction.
            </p>
            <p>
                I got a review copy of Beyond Java some time ago. I feel a
                little bad because I didn't review it. Frankly it didn't hold my
                interest; I mostly got it because I was told I was referenced in
                it (it was a footnote link to
                <a
                    class="reference"
                    href="why-web-programming-matters-most.html"
                    >this post</a
                >). And of course it was an uphill battle for the book, since I
                have never used Java and am largely indifferent to the platform.
            </p>
            <p>
                What the book lacked was any useful exploration of what is
                beyond Java. Instead it was essentially some email exchanges
                with people about what they thought the advantages of other
                environments were. Lots of the people referenced didn't have
                very strong backgrounds outside of Java, or didn't really speak
                as anything more than an advocate. I expect more measured and
                thoughtful responses out of a book; the web can provide me with
                whatever advocacy I desire. There should be <em>some</em> point
                to getting a book over reading blogs. I suppose it's not Bruce's
                fault that the blogs win out here -- I'll attribute that to the
                ever-increasing quality of discussion on blogs, and books just
                aren't keeping up.
            </p>
            <p>
                There's a lot of material to explore when you venture beyond
                Java. It's not all good out here. There's whole new ways to mess
                up. And maybe the details are beyond the scope of the book, but
                it's a <em>whole book</em>, not a blog post that should try hard
                to stay under one screenful. There's room for some good details.
            </p>
            <p>
                For instance, here's a bit of advice: using a new sexy
                technology can be a strategy to bring great developers to your
                shop. Often the new technology is a buyers market for the
                employer -- developers want to use it, but most employers aren't
                even considering it. But the new technology becomes less new,
                the novelty wears off, and the developers may very well notice
                that the work they are being asked to do sucks, and they will
                leave. Or to phrase it another way: you can pay a great
                developer enough and give them enough freedom to start on a
                lifeless soul sucking project, but you can't make them stay. Do
                you think your project is actually worthy of great developers?
                For a lot of Java shops that answer is probably <em>no</em>.
                (You can't get them to
                <a
                    class="reference"
                    href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?CthreeProjectTerminated"
                    >live in Detroit and work on payroll systems</a
                >
                either, even with a cool language and hip development
                methodology.)
            </p>
            <p>
                (As an aside, and as a Python developer: you can keep your dumb
                jobs, you can keep your proprietary community, you can keep your
                enterprise, because
                <em
                    >please don't come bother us with your boring enterprisey
                    problems</em
                >)
            </p>
            <p>
                Beyond Java didn't really talk about stuff like this. I can't
                believe it's because of a lack of knowledge, wisdom, and
                experience around these issues either -- but this knowledge
                isn't (by definition!) in the Java community where Bruce Tate
                probably hangs out.
            </p>
            <p>
                I was going to react to Joe's original post, not just the book,
                particularly whether Beyond Java asked the right question. But
                because I think that reaction is more interesting than this
                review I'll do that separately.

            <p>Mmmmm. Flamebait. Yummy.</p>

            <p>
                The bit about "proprietary community" is unfair. Java has a
                large, active open source community around it and Sun is slowly
                openning up the core language too. The rest of it is arguable.

                        Yeah, flamey I'll admit. However, I'm not talking about
                        Java developers particularly; I didn't really mean to
                        say anything against Java. Just because boring jobs call
                        for things like Java doesn't mean Java is necessarily a
                        bad language. And honestly, someone has to do those jobs
                        and build those systems. Using exciting technology to
                        build boring products eventually becomes old, and in an
                        open source community it doesn't just become old for the
                        people building the systems, but the boring trickles out
                        into the rest of the community. No fun. Proprietary
                        development tends to support boring programming jobs
                        better than open source. Some people might like to get
                        something for nothing from the F/OSS community, but that
                        doesn't always work.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I guess I really was saying: it doesn't always work, and
                        I personally have no incentive to make it work or offer
                        ideas on how to make it work.

                            Well, Ian, I really admire your stuff, and
                            appreciate your dedication to Python as a web
                            development language. However, if the job isn't in
                            Detroit, and isn't a payroll system , the simple
                            fact that the job description may include
                            &quot;Python&quot; experience can have exactly the
                            effect you described earlier, of attracting coders.
                            Even if it is about &quot;boring enterprisey
                            problems.&quot; In other words, it seems to me that
                            the opportunity to address SOA, ESB, etc. with
                            Python opens the door to building clean,
                            lightweight, flexible, extensible, maintainable, and
                            evolvable tools. Once you get that, the boring part
                            is much less of an issue, IMHO.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Another point that you might consider. Maybe some
                            folks don't get bored so easily, and really enjoy
                            the ongoing challenge of keeping a system running
                            with clean, efficient code, while avoiding bloat,
                            one-offs, etc. I guess what I'm saying is that I
                            think garden variety coders deserve the chance to
                            use Python too!

                    What's interresting, is that I think you hit a point with
                    java as a language for poor programmers (even if I think
                    there are really good programmers in the java community,
                    look at Hibernate for example or JBoss). But here in France
                    most managers choose Java because they don't want to depend
                    upon good programmers, they want to depends upon bad
                    programmers. In fact buzz word here for managers is
                    &quot;Industrialization of software production&quot; which
                    sounds as &quot;programmers are the new semiskilled
                    worker&quot; (Managers prefers when human beings just
                    becomes non essential ressources). That's Why I prefer the
                    term rationalization (which for me means better Q&amp;A and
                    realistic project management specific to software
                    production).

                    Ok, there seems to be some division between Java
                    communities. All in all, I do not have a problem with
                    <em>enterprise</em>. Its how I make a living. Although; in
                    regards to a programming language, things should be open and
                    clear. I think JAVA belongs in business (As well as other
                    places). But business does not belong in JAVA--or any real
                    programming language, for that matter.
