            <p>
                I had to turn comments off briefly, as the spam was
                overwhelming. I still need to clean that out, but for now I've
                installed a custom CAPTCHA (one string hardcoded that you must
                type in -- low tech indeed). So if you were just really wanting
                to comment on something and you were foiled, you can try again.
