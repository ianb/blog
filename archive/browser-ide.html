        <h1>A Browser IDE</h1>

        <div class="document">
            <p>
                Here's an idea: we need an IDE experience that bridges the web
                browser with the editing environment.
            </p>
            <p>
                Doing it <em>all</em> in the browser is a bad idea. I won't go
                into why, except perhaps that textarea remains so horribly bad
                as to make the idea practically laughable. But I also think that
                editing and the browser can be seen as separate experiences
                beyond just key bindings.
            </p>
            <p>
                Still, the web browser provides a compelling target in a lot of
                ways. It kind of occurred to me when I saw
                <a
                    class="reference"
                    href="http://tungwaiyip.info/software/sample_test_report.html"
                    >this example</a
                >
                of
                <a
                    class="reference"
                    href="http://tungwaiyip.info/software/#htmltestrunner"
                    >HTMLTestRunner</a
                >. Maybe I got distracted by
                <a class="reference" href="http://fit.c2.com/">FIT</a>, which is
                a kind of non-programmer interface. There's lots of other
                in-between web apps, like the stuff in the
                <a class="reference" href="http://turbogears.org/docs/toolbox/"
                    >TurboGears toolbox</a
                >, Paste's
                <a class="reference" href="ajaxy-exception-catching.html"
                    >interactive exception reporter</a
                >, and elsewhere (as in some of the web-based interactive
                consoles).
            </p>
            <p>
                Still, there's a context switch. Yes, it's nice to see stuff in
                a web browser -- with a simpler and often more complete UI
                experience than an IDE -- but I still like my editor. So how to
                bridge this?
            </p>
            <p>
                I'm thinking
                <a
                    class="reference"
                    href="http://plope.com/software/ExternalEditor"
                    >Zope's ExternalEditor</a
                >
                is one model (particularly the
                <tt class="docutils literal"
                    ><span class="pre">zopeedit</span></tt
                >
                side). It uses WebDAV (a subset, really -- the methods it uses
                are very limited) to open an editor. But this does lose some of
                the experience of an actual local file. But that's relatively
                easy to change. Either way, it involves sending some custom mime
                type (e.g.,
                <tt class="docutils literal"
                    ><span class="pre">application/x-zope-edit</span></tt
                >) that sends information about the file (auth header and URL
                for zopeedit, maybe a host and filename would be another
                option). And maybe other little tweaks, like a line number.
                (E.g., click on a traceback frame to open the editor on that
                exact point.)
            </p>
            <p>
                Hmmm... something to think about, and not just for web
                development. Maybe it's just because I'm more comfortable with
                web programming and Ajaxy stuff, compared to GUI development,
                but this seems much more approachable for developing an full
                development experience (<em>not</em> integrated) than trying to
                build or extend a traditional &quot;full&quot; IDE. Or maybe it
                is to say that this seems more appealing than console-based
                non-integrated development environments. For example, I think
                the interactive debugger is way easier to use than
                <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">pdb</span></tt>
                even if it has less features. (But again, because this is a
                non-integrated environment, it is quite possible that you could
                swap in a traditional GUI debugger like
                <a
                    class="reference"
                    href="http://www.digitalpeers.com/pythondebugger/"
                    >Winpdb</a
                >).
            </p>
            <p>
                Another goal I see, is that with a non-integrated environment it
                is much easier to build framework- or application-specific tools
                that &quot;fit&quot; into the system, if only because there's
                such a low bar for &quot;fitting&quot;.
            </p>

                <p>
                    I believe that a built in browser development environment
                    could work for certain scenarios, and it has been a blue sky
                    thought experiment of mine since around 2001 when I started
                    hacking XUL. The textarea in a browser doesn't _have_ to be
                    that bad. It's all about how much effort you're willing to
                    put into javascript hacking.

                        Having programmed in textareas for a while, it's really
                        quite bad. Yes, you can implement search and replace,
                        and you can do auto-saving, and in-place saves instead
                        of resubmitting, and several other improvements. But I
                        just can't imagine it being good for editing. For mere
                        entry -- like what you might do at the interactive
                        prompt -- it's redeamable.
