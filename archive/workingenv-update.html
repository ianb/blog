</div><h1>workingenv.py update</h1>
 
<div class="document">
<p>I've been using <a class="reference" href="http://cheeseshop.python.org/pypi/workingenv.py">workingenv</a> more lately, and I
thought I'd talk more about its goals.</p>
<p>If you haven't used it, or didn't read/remember the original post, the
basic idea is that you do this:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
$ wget http://svn.colorstudy.com/home/ianb/workingenv/workingenv.py
$ python workingenv.py NewEnvironment
$ cd NewEnvironment
$ source bin/activate
</pre>
<p>This creates an isolated environment in <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">NewEnvironment/</span></tt> that
contains its own libraries isolated from the rest of the system.  As
such it is very similar to <a class="reference" href="http://peak.telecommunity.com/dist/virtual-python.py">virtual-python.py</a> but perhaps
slightly simpler, in that it doesn't create a new <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">python</span></tt>
executable or symlink over the entire standard library.  Honestly
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">virtual-python</span></tt> works quite well too, though I suppose workingenv
works on Windows (without symlinks); at least, I hear it does, I've
never tried it.</p>
<p>This is great for tutorials and examples, since the result is a very
controlled system.  It's common for people to forget that they have
all sorts of hidden requirements installed on their system, and since
workinenv removes <em>all</em> of those libraries (including everything in
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">site-packages</span></tt> unless you give the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">--site-packages</span></tt> option) you
won't forget anything.  It's very repeatable.</p>
<p>There's some other features lingering in workingenv that might be
additionally useful.  In particular <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">--requirements</span></tt>, which lets you
give a set of requirements to be installed by <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">easy_install</span></tt> when
the environment is set up (you can also track the requirements over
time to confirm you are up-to-date).  For instance:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
$ python workingenv.py \
  --requirements=https://svn.openplans.org/svn/training/pylons/requirements.txt \
  NewPylonsEnvironment
</pre>
<p>This is the Pylons environment we used for the a mini-tutorial in the
framework at TOPP.  If you look at the file, it's just a text file
with one requirement per line.  You can also use <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">-f</span>
<span class="pre">someplace_to_find_links</span></tt>, which will in effect add that option to all
subsequent <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">easy_install</span></tt> invocations.  Pylons has such a page at
<a class="reference" href="http://pylonshq.com/download/">http://pylonshq.com/download/</a>, TurboGears at
<a class="reference" href="http://www.turbogears.org/download/">http://www.turbogears.org/download/</a>, etc.  And <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">-e</span> <span class="pre">Package</span></tt> to
install an editable version of a package, which you can use for all
your internal/in-development packages.  Later on you can rerun
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">workingenv.py</span></tt> to update the environment and requirements, or run
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">workingenv.py</span> <span class="pre">--confirm</span> <span class="pre">NewPylonsEnvironment/</span></tt> to check if anything
has changed in the requirements file, or any requirements aren't in
sync.</p>
<p>Some other things I'd like to add:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Show all libraries that are installed but <em>aren't</em> required by any
requirements file (either detecting dependencies that should be
added, or packages that aren't needed and should be deleted).</li>
<li>A command to include libraries from the system <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">site-packages/</span></tt>
into the environment.  This is useful for libraries that might be
hard to build in the new environment, like <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">MySQLdb</span></tt>.</li>
<li>A command to build a requirements file from the current state of the
working environment.  Then you could build up a working set and come
up with a succinct description of that set.  An option could make it
very specific (with exact versions, suitable for deployment), and
flexible (with the most recent versions, suitable for development).</li>
<li>If anyone knows a way to avoid hardcoding a full path in
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">bin/activate</span></tt>, I'd love to know.  That's the only place where the
full path is coded in, so other than that the environment can be
safely moved around.</li>
</ul>
<p>Notably another project with some similar goals is <a class="reference" href="http://cheeseshop.python.org/pypi/zc.buildout">zc.buildout</a>.  zc.buildout is
more declarative, and works off a configuration file instead of
interactive commands.  For example, you install something something in
a buildout by changing the configuration and rebuilding.  You install
something in a working environment by using <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">easy_install</span></tt>.
zc.buildout is also more general -- it has recipes to do more than
just install eggs, it can also build packages with <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">configure;</span> <span class="pre">make;</span>
<span class="pre">make</span> <span class="pre">install</span></tt> (cmmi), and you can add new recipes for more
complicated setups.  I've found it more difficult to get my head
around, especially how to support both production and development
deployments.  But if you are interested in this sort of thing, you
should certainly give it a look (I've noticed it already has
considerably more documentation than when I last looked).</p>

<p>I have to say I've been using workingenv for a while now and it is really helpful.  Everyday I need to work with more than one module from subversion and this is a nice way to go.  I was having a little bit of trouble getting 2.4 and 2.5 environs going side by side (I think the local easy_install script was getting overwritten) but maybe it was fixed when I blew away my env and started over, can't recall.  I'll let you know if it comes up again.</p>
<p>Is there a way to repair an existing workingenv?  I know you have been tweaking issues for compatibility w/ setuptools here and there (invalid site.py error, etc).  Obviously I haven't looked at the new --confirm option.  Maybe that does it.</p>
<p>One thing I'm trying to find time for in my company is convert our hand-rolled continuous integration package to buildbot.  I think workingenv would be a nice way to automate the buildbot environment for each test suite.  Has anyone tried something like this yet?</p>

<p>The new version saves your configuration information in <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">.workingenv/*</span></tt>, so you can simply re-run <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">python</span> <span class="pre">workingenv.py</span> <span class="pre">existing-env</span></tt>.  It'll ask you before overwriting any files.</p>

<p>I haven't, but it definitely seems like a good way to do this.</p>

<p>For reasons unknown the setuptools egg was not being expanded, apparently with my switch to Python 2.5 or related changes.</p>
<p>I forced it with a change to  workingenv.py</p>
<p>517c517</p>
<p>&lt;     os.system('%s %s --install-dir=%s --script-dir=%s --always-copy '</p>

<p>I'm getting this error only on one of my machines and having trouble tracking down the cause:</p>
<p>site.py is not a setuptools-generated site.py; please remove it.</p>
<p>well, obviously the site.py is not setuptools-generated but on other machines with the latest version of workingenv and setuptools I don't see this error.  The only difference (I can tell) is that on the erroring machine python 2.5 is installed.  I don't see how that would be related.  I tried killing setuptools in the base (2.4 and 2.5) and the env, re-building the env; still no luck.  Any other ideas?</p>
