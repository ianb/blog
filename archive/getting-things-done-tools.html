        <div class="document">
            <p>
                I have a week off in between jobs, and I want to use this time
                as a chance to get things in my life organized. So I've just
                started reading
                <a
                    class="reference"
                    href="http://www.davidco.com/what_is_gtd.php"
                    >Getting Things Done</a
                >, and I like it so far.
            </p>
            <p>
                Of course as I read I can't help but think about the tools I
                could program to help me do this task management process. But
                that's a distraction, a way for me to replace something I don't
                enjoy (organizing) with something I do enjoy (programming).
            </p>
            <p>
                Luckily, I have noticed that many programmers before me have
                procrastinated in this way, and there's lots of tools already
                out there, and I don't have to get distracted with programming
                quite yet. But what tools have worked well with GTD? Here's some
                general domains that occur to me:
            </p>
            <ul class="simple">
                <li>
                    Task tracking, with easy item adding, and a distinction
                    between the inbox, actions, projects, etc. I imagine a
                    web-based system, but with some non-web interfaces for
                    certain aspects. Or, at least, web-based with a good HTTP
                    API and perhaps some non-web tools that use that API.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Email tracking. Email is my bane. I don't even know what
                    this would look like. Preferably in the form of a
                    Thunderbird extension, or maybe (<em>maybe</em>) a clever
                    IMAP intermediary. I subscribe to many mailing lists, which
                    are very different from other kinds of email; extensions or
                    just processes that handle both kinds of email intelligently
                    would be appreciated.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Calendars. Paper or computer? I'm not sure -- unless there's
                    something compellingly simple, I'm likely to stick to paper,
                    because paper is actually pretty nice. Opinions? Potentially
                    one of the web-2.0-ish calendars with a public API and
                    appropriate tools (integration with task tracking?)
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                I've just started the book, so other ideas might occur to me.
                Probably in lots of cases the best solution is using some simple
                tools along with good work practices using those tools --
                encoding every concept and goal into the tool itself is
                generally a bad idea. For instance, I've seem people suggest the
                <a
                    class="reference"
                    href="http://www.longshot.com/~kmixter/gmailui.html"
                    >GMailUI</a
                >
                extension as being useful for a GTD-like organization process.

                    I found it useful to stick to paper while I was learning the
                    system. After you start to get comfortable, you'll make some
                    minor adjustments and paper is unbeatable for allowing rapid
                    changes. If you code something up or tie yourself to a
                    software tool too early, you'll end up a little more stuck
                    with how it works rather than what's best for your
                    particular situation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    (and once I was comfortable, I of course coded up my own
                    little web based system which was basically just a little
                    web app with infinitely nestable lists, a nice AJAX
                    interface for expanding, collapsing, adding sub-items, and a
                    nightly cronjob to move items from the tickler lists to the
                    INBOX list).

                        Tools for email would be really nice, though, since you
                        definitely can't do that on paper. And much of what he
                        talks about seems very applicable to email, but I'm not
                        sure how to actually <em>do</em> them in an email
                        client. Email is like a microcosm of the entire GTD
                        system.

                                I have to agree with this comment. I've been
                                using todo.sh as well and it works wonderfully.
                                It's easily parsed, there is a community working
                                on making it better. And there is even an
                                initial port to Python as well.

                    I try to avoid all of that GTD koolaid that everyone is
                    drinking, but I see the value in the process. I've been
                    using a TiddlyWiki variant (<a

            <p>I use a method called bubble sorting, and text files.</p>

            <p>
                I bubble sort the most important items to the top. Occasionaly
                changing the order of things, and adding new ones.
            </p>

            <p>
                Text files are good because they are quick to edit. They are
                compatible between OS's, you can use version control, grep, text
                searches. You can email them to yourself. You can read them on
                your phone, or even on some cameras. Computers have been able to
                edit text files since as long as they have existed.
            </p>

            <p>
                Each client I have a separate text file for. With todo, and a
                log of time and various notes. I also have a general log file
                (886KB) that I use for every thing.
            </p>

            <p>
                You need a journal to keep notes. Notes like how to do some
                obscure undocumented thing. Or to give yourself a reminder. Also
                as a todo list.
            </p>

            <p>
                For todo items the wording is especially important. If it is
                vague, it's not a good todo note. They should be specific things
                that you can just do. If it requires thinking then you change
                the todo note so it is something specific. If you need to do
                research, write something specific too. 'search cheeseshop, and
                python.org for good Widget.'
            </p>

            <pre>
eg.

BAD
- Program admin section of website A.

GOOD
- Copy in admin section from website C into website A.

</pre
            >

            <p>
                Here is an example of a log I use. I just paste the date in from
                a date command. (which in vi I can run from an xterm, or from
                inside vi).
            </p>

            <p>
                Note how I also say what I am going to do directly next. Also I
                keep a running total of the time spent. Also as I go, I bubble
                sort and change my todo list.
            </p>

            <p>I think it is an elegant and light weight method.</p>

                    google calendar; It works pretty well, and has one clear
                    advantage.

                <p>
                    When i create an item on my calendar I want to forget about
                    it until either 30 minutes before hand or 24 hours before.
                    Google calendar alerts me via text message to my phone at
                    the time I select, and thats just perfect.

                <p>
                    (being able to use a quick link and create calendar events
                    from gmail is nice, and their understanding of simple
                    entries like &quot;dinner &#64;6pm&quot; makes it just get
                    out of your way and waste less of your time).

                    I have recently returned to an oft-delayed task of putting
                    my personal GTD plan into action (there is something almost
                    zen about that now that I think about it...) and it seems
                    like the first major decision you have to make is what
                    particular tools to apply to the task.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Since I tend to live in email I bit the bullet and moved
                    over to Thunderbird so that I would have the same client on
                    both my Mac and PC (if you have the luxury of being Mac-only
                    then just pop over to 43 folders and read through the tips
                    there...) Next up was to google around for Thunderbird + GTD
                    and pick up a quick set of suggestions from a couple of
                    blogs on how to use labels, filters, and a few extensions to
                    get things under control.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I can't say yet if this is going to be the best path or one
                    that I would suggest to you, but one point in favor of using
                    your email inbox to run your GTD system is that the basic
                    tools are omni-present. If I need to add a new item to the
                    queue I can email it to myself from my Treo while on-the-go
                    and various mail clients that can hit my IMAP mailbox give
                    me the ability to update things from wherever I happen to
                    be.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Good luck, and please continue to share any cool tips or
                    insights you discover while setting up your own system.

                        The email thing is compelling, because there's no way I
                        can move email tasks out of email (just too much work
                        and shuffling around to make the physical move), but
                        it's relatively easy to move things <em>into</em> email.
                        The only problem is the interface... but maybe with a
                        little procmail, some client extensions, and some
                        scripts (e.g., a script to add a task, which needn't be
                        as complicated as opening a new email typing my name
                        into the address and all that)... that might work
                        sufficiently.

                        seems to be the best summary of a labeling method for
                        Thunderbird. I like that it uses labels even for things
                        Thunderbird does natively (like deletion), because in my
                        experience some operations (like delete or moving
                        folders) require just a little bit more time to process
                        (say, 0.5 seconds) that slows me down. Flagging and
                        operating en masse after the processing is done will
                        give that little speed boost that I know I'll
                        appreciate.

                    <p>
                        todo.sh looks interesting, but I don't know how
                        important I'd find some of its features. Specifically,
                        managing a list through the command line seems a little
                        crude. I think just being able to send messages into the
                        system without using a mail client will be sufficient
                        for me.

                    The best tool ever for me, especially because I use emacs,

                    There is a &quot;multi&quot; option within. This option
                    allow you to have a task in different projects/contexts,
                    quite nice for GTD setup. I am more using it to make a list
                    of things todo in the current week. Then every morning I
                    check my week page and schedule items in my day page.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I have tried many others, web based or not, personal hacks
                    or not, and was only pleased after using this mode. If you
                    are using another text editor, I am sure you can find a
                    similar tool to manage your todo and calendar from within
                    it.

                    I figured it would take me a while to find the tools that
                    fit with my workflow and life best. Also, I didn't want to
                    have my data on one computer because I work on different
                    computers.

                    I have a 79 cent spiral ring notebook with a pen that fits
                    in the spiral. It's small, easy to write in, really cheap,
                    and very portable. So that works really well for me for
                    &quot;capturing&quot; things so I don't have to remember
                    them. I check my notebook once or twice a day when I'm near
                    a computer to organize, think about things, do things that
                    can be done at that moment, and move important items to my
                    todo lists.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Then I use Ta-da Lists (<a
                        class="reference"
                        href="http://www.tadalist.com/"
                        >http://www.tadalist.com/</a
                    >) to keep track of items that are on my short-term todo
                    list. It has RSS feeds and allows for multiple lists. The
                    Terms of Service expressly state &quot;no bots&quot; which
                    is a bit unfortunate. I like the interface.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'd recommend skimming 43 Folders (<a

                Ian, For managing mailing lists, I recommending using Gmane,

                impersonal nature of lists. Thunderbird has a decent-enough news

                    I read GTD several years back, and it revolutionized the way
                    I manage my time. I have seen increases in my productivity
                    that defy description.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I too was chomping at the bit to code some sort of simple
                    app or plug-in to assist in the GTD way of, um, getting
                    things done.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the long run, I have found that pen &amp; paper (for me,
                    a nice moleskine notebook and a quality pilot razor point
                    pen) work best. Interestingly enough, that's exactly what
                    the author suggests (VERY loosely paraphrasing here - it's
                    been a while): years of teaching this approach to time and
                    task management have shown me that computer programs
                    designed to ease the process don't do much in the long run
                    but get in the way. He goes on to suggest keeping things
                    simple with pen &amp; paper.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I still tried a number of computer-based alternatives, even
                    though the author explains quite clearly that he has
                    historical evidence to suggest they don't work. I have to
                    admit - if I ever meet the guy, he'd have every right to say
                    &quot;I told you so.&quot;
                </p>
                <p>
                    So I'll echo his advice to you: forget about writing (or
                    finding) the GTD &quot;killer app.&quot; Do it the old
                    fashioned way, the way it's been <em>proven</em> to work.
                    You won't be disappointed.

                    I've been running the Firefox extension GTDGmail for a few
                    days now. It provides a bunch of convenience functions for
                    using Gmail's labels as a makeshift GTD system. Integration
                    with Google Calendar would be nice...but I'm still waiting
                    for that within Gmail vanilla, so I can't really fault the
                    GTDGmail extension for its absence.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'm already finding that it's <em>really</em> helping with
                    keeping my inbox clean...if a message doesn't fit into a
                    project, it generally doesn't need keeping.
                </p>
                <p>
                    However, I'm unsure how accessible it is as a first-exposure
                    to GTD tools. The docs are minimal; I found myself relying
                    on experience gained from the GTD TiddlyWiki mods (MonkeyGTD
                    is especially good:
                    <a class="reference" href="http://monkeygtd.tiddlyspot.com/"
                        >http://monkeygtd.tiddlyspot.com/</a
                    >) to understand how to use their labelling system.
