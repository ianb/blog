                Well, after trying
                <a class="reference" href="what-is-wsgikit.html">twice</a>
                <a class="reference" href="what-can-wsgikit-do-for-you.html"
                    >before</a
                >, I think I didn't actually make it clear what Paste is. I
                don't know if I've done any better this time, but I'll keep
                trying. I'm not sure entirely what the confusion is -- in part
                Paste is several disconnected things, in part I think people
                read more into it than there is (it's not any Deep New Ideas),
                or maybe I'm leaving out important details. Feedback welcome.

                    It has come up several times that people don't understand
                    quite what Paste is and what it is intended to be. This
                    document is an attempt to respond to that.

                <p>
                    In part the confusion has been because Paste has is really
                    several things. It is an attempt to fill in some of the gaps
                    in web frameworks, and to identify places where things can
                    be shared; as such it is a reaction to the current state of
                    frameworks, and a direct attempt to be complimentary to
                    those frameworks. As a result it can be somewhat eclectic.

                    defines how servers invoke applications, and how application
                    respond. However, it does not define how servers or
                    applications come into existance, or how they are passed to
                    each other.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Paste is meant to bridge that, but providing a single entry
                    point that can create and configure a server, create an WSGI
                    application, and hook the two together.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This generally involves distinct code for each server
                    supported, since there isn't any standard.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Also, Paste is expected to create the applications that get
                    served. This is typically done through at least
                    somewhat-custom code that is driven by the configuration.
                    Which leads us to...
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="section" id="configuration">
                <h1><a name="configuration">Configuration</a></h1>
                <p>
                    In order to set up servers and application, some kind of
                    configuration is needed. Paste loads up configuration files
                    and makes these available to all parts of the system.
                </p>
                <p>
                    One goal of Paste is to support small pieces of decoupled
                    code that work together. This is part of its WSGI-driven
                    architecture. However, exactly how that code is split up is
                    an implementation detail that really shouldn't be exposed to
                    end users. Because of this, each component can't have its
                    own configuration without resulting in a mess of
                    configuration files and formats that are fragile and
                    difficult to understand.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This configuration is accessible from all portions of the
                    system, so your application configuration can go in beside
                    server and middleware configuration.

                <p>
                    WSGI allows for the idea of &quot;middleware&quot; --
                    something that is both a server and an application. This is
                    similar to a filter or a wrapper. By building these on WSGI,
                    they are neutral with respect to any particular framework.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Use of the middleware is generally optional, but they serve
                    as a way to share work, and tend to be a fairly good
                    architecture for many problems.

                    Another kind of middleware is one which finds and constructs
                    applications. At the moment, just one such middleware is in
                    the library:
                    <tt class="docutils literal"
                        ><span class="pre">paste.urlparser</span></tt
                    >. This looks on disk for files and Python modules, and
                    creates WSGI applications from them. Other URL resolvers are
                    also possible, e.g., one that traverses objects, or uses
                    explicit URL-&gt;application maps.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="section" id="otherwise-homeless-code">
                <h1>
                    <a name="otherwise-homeless-code"
                        >Otherwise Homeless Code</a
                    >
                </h1>
                <p>
                    All code has to go somewhere. Sometimes there's not a good
                    location for that code. So it can go in Paste.
                </p>
                <div class="section" id="an-implementation-webware">

                        is a reimplementation of Webware built on the Paste
                        middleware. This is a fairly thin implementation, mostly
                        mapping the middleware APIs to Webware APIs.

                    <p>
                        This avoids the stale-code issue, where code in memory
                        gets out of sync with code on disk. When that happens
                        confusion can ensue. Manually restarting is also
                        somewhat annoying, so this does the restarting for you.
                        It's not really appropriate for a live deployment, but
                        it works well in development.

                    application using these systems. After the application is
                    set up,
                    <tt class="docutils literal"
                        ><span class="pre">paste-setup</span></tt
                    >
                    can provide other commands. For instance in a webkit_zpt
                    application
                    <tt class="docutils literal"
                        ><span class="pre">paste-setup</span>
                        <span class="pre">servlet</span>
                        <span class="pre">edit</span></tt
                    >
                    will create
                    <tt class="docutils literal"
                        ><span class="pre">web/edit.py</span></tt
                    >
                    and
                    <tt class="docutils literal"
                        ><span class="pre">web/edit.pt</span></tt
                    >
                    files. Each template has control implement any commands how
                    it sees fit, but some convenient functions and classes are
                    provided to make implementation easier.
                </p>

            <div class="section" id="distribution">

                    This is still an open issue, but I hope Paste will
                    facilitate installation of multiple frameworks quickly. Some
                    of this is handled already:
                    <tt class="docutils literal"
                        ><span class="pre">paste-server</span></tt
                    >
                    starts a server easily and quickly, and
                    <tt class="docutils literal"
                        ><span class="pre">paste-setup</span></tt
                    >
                    gives a user the basis for an application quickly. Actual
                    software installation is a little harder. Right now the plan
                    is to use
                    <a
                        class="reference"
                        href="http://peak.telecommunity.com/DevCenter/PythonEggs"
                        >Python Eggs</a
                    >, but it's just a plan. Python Eggs are still in
                    development (though usable), and it requires creating
                    packages for each project (which is feasible, but requires a
                    fair amount of grunt work).

                    I've been following the work on Paste on svn, and missed two
                    things, the first on is this explanation (I think it can use
                    some more examples, though) and another one is a ChangeLog
                    file for tracking development. Is this last one awkward to
                    work with? Thanks for the good work!

                        I guess I've never really kept a change log for any
                        project I've done. I try to keep good svn log messages,
                        and
                        <a

                        will let you track that. Once there are releases I want
                        to keep a news file for significant API changes (which
                        is generally much easier to track than a change log).
                        The bug tracker should keep track of some other details.
                        I'm not sure exactly where a change log fits into that.

                            Oh, I wasn't aware of that one. Maybe it could be
                            possible to pipe the check-in messages into a
                            ChangeLog style file so those check-in messages can
                            be read without svn or an avaliable connection...
                            Maybe I'm too lazy, or too used to a way of doing
                            things, but I track quite a bunch of projects and I
                            use to read the ChangeLogs to see what has been
                            going on and when something appealing catches my
                            attention I give it a closer look. I just thought
                            that would make some people track Paste more
                            closely... and it deserves it :)

                    Sorry, but I still don't get it. Parts of paste are clearer

                    I just came here from a link on the Python Daily URL. This
                    doesn't really explain it for me. Sometimes when I write
                    documentation, I try to address who the reader is and what
                    they're used to seeing, which often means separate
                    paragraphs (or even chapters) for the particular audience.

                    Myself, I use Python and Java to write (non-web)
                    applications, and Apache + PHP to write web sites &amp; web
                    applications. So for me, I was basically lost by the second

                    I guess you're assuming knowledge of WSGI. Maybe the
                    introduction needs a sentence like &quot;Before trying to
                    understand what Paste is, you should know what WSGI is (link
                    to a _What_is_WSGI_ document)&quot;

                            IMHO a better bet will be to direct it to people
                            with little experience. A developer experienced in
                            python web frameworks will be less impressed, he/she
                            will have a lot of habits acquired in the other
                            frameworks, will be more reluctant to change and
                            Paste has to be really really good to impress him.

                            A beginner caries a lot less baggage. He will give
                            Paste 10, 20 maybe 30 min. and if in that time Paste
                            impresses him there is a good chance he will use it.

                            I'm a beginner and I see &quot;Zope Page

                            by the word Zope when I look at the mini
                            introduction to TAL I'm thinking &quot;What the heck
                            is this?&quot; a beginner will see to much
                            information, a seasoned programmer will see
                            redundancy.

                            In my view Paste will be better served using
                            something like HTMLTemplate
                            <a

                            >, it is simple, powerful and did I mentioned
                            simple? Yeah simple, how simple? well... copying one
                            .py file somewhere in the PYTHONPATH takes care of
                            the installation. Using it is just as simple.

                        <p>
                            Take the beginner from A to Z, show him a quick
                            install, a simple example, a simple but not trivial
                            example, a complex example and of course provide
                            value. For example if John Doe were to install Paste
                            and instantly get a Wiki and a blog or a bliki as a

                            recommend Paste to all his friends. He might not
                            care that is python as long as it works or maybe he
                            just discovered python and wants to use it in
                            everything or maybe he is like me... hateing PHP
                            syntax.

                            Go after the beginners! there are a lot more of them
                            than seasoned programmers, they might be more
                            forgiving especially if you put up a big sign saying
                            &quot;Alpha&quot; and if they can do it... seasoned
                            programmers will have no other excuse not to at
                            least try it.

                            That was my feeling too knowing nothing about
                            WSGI... I read all 3 of your attempts to explain
                            Paste and I think this one is much better than the
                            ones before but still maybe not basic enough...
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Maybe a bit more structure would help as well, it
                            might be just me but some more headlines, a kind of
                            table of contents even for an article as short as
                            this would help. There something like &quot;What is
                            WSGI&quot;, &quot;How does a server fit in&quot;,
                            etc could fit in.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I guess an example of a specific server + paste +
                            application (that's the way it works, is it not?)
                            like apache + paste + ? would also show more than a
                            lot of explaining.

                            I read your stuff quite frequently and always wonder
                            how you find the time to actually do stuff
                            <em>and</em> at the same time read/investigate/try
                            in all other web frameworks and other tools...
                            That's actually something you seem to assume from
                            the casual reader. I do read a lot about some of the
                            (it seems) 100s of Python web frameworks but have
                            not been able to try one as there are so many and I
                            am always looking for a really good solution Paste
                            might be to get to.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Just some ideas, actually writing a good
                            documentation <em>and</em> explaining what something
                            is for all kinds of users is very difficult...
                            (something I am experiencing myself at the moment)

                    I was just trying to get the energy together to lurn Zope3
                    when I saw this nice, literate looking exercise. Though I
                    don't understand it.

                    One thing you don't mention is persistence. This is a key
                    feature of what i think are probably the top three competing
                    python frameworks - zope with ZODB, sqlobject with subway
                    and atop with the twisted/nevow/quotient stuff.
                </p>
                <p>What's your plan for persistence with paste?</p>
