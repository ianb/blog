        <h1>Thoughts on Ruby on Rails</h1>
        <p>
            After looking at
            <a href="http://www.rubyonrails.org/">Ruby on Rails</a> a bit more
            closely, I responded to a
            <a
                href="http://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-list/2004-November/248835.html"
                >comp.lang.python thread</a
            >
            on it. I thought I'd copy my thoughts here:
        </p>

        <p>
            I've looked a little at Rails. It's not super special. Well, it
            <i>is</i> compared to things like Java; dynamic languages
            <i>are</i> quite superior for rapid development of websites, and
            Ruby and Python are similar languages in that way.
        </p>

        <p>
            Rails is really a whole stack that works well together. People have
            been writing this sort of thing in Python for a long time; which
            isn't to say they always have gotten it right, or that those efforts
            have had the right perspective to be strategic successes (i.e.,
            become popular).
        </p>

        <p>Lessee... Rails seems to have:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                A simple object publisher. There's a ton of these in Python. It
                also perhaps includes some sort of MVC system, where the object
                picks up a template automatically if it exists. These exist as
                well, though I think MVC efforts can become overly ambitious or
                overly restrictive fairly easily.
            </li>

            <li>
                An object-relational mapper. I'd say this is close to
                <a href="http://sqlobject.org">SQLObject</a>, though SQLObject
                is in some ways more powerful.
            </li>

            <li>
                A templating system. Looks like ASP. There's lots of templating
                languages in Python; the simplest (e.g., embed Python code) can
                be problematic because of Python's significant whitespace. But
                anyway, we have lots and lots of these, and there are real
                reasons for why there's multiple templating languages. Spyce is
                probably the closest to Rails.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            All three of these pieces fit together really well in Rails, which
            is perhaps what it offers that Python doesn't have. Well, I'm sure
            some framework out there has this, but it's hard to say, there's so
            damn many.
        </p>

        <p>
            But, while this is really compelling when you show off the creation
            of a simple system, I suspect it becomes a fair amount more
            complicated later on. At least, that is my experience with Python
            projects of similar ambition. It's neat to setup a database and have
            it work instantly, complete with the standard
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CRUD">CRUD</a> forms. But this
            only works for "leaf" tables, and even then no so well. How do you
            deal with joins? How do you deal with complex requirements on input,
            or actions on updates? Eventually you'll need to tweak a generated
            form just a <i>little</i>, does that mean you have to throw away all
            the automated aspects and code it by hand?
        </p>

        <p>
            I don't mean to criticize Rails with these questions; it's not that
            Python frameworks solve these wonderfully either, these are just
            hard problems. But for realistic web applications these are
            inevitable issues, and I suspect Rails isn't quite as compelling
            when you take them into account.
        </p>

        <p>
            OTOH, I'd love to see something in Python that is just as tight as
            Rails, but uses all the pieces we've already developed. It's really
            just a question of sticking pieces together; but that's a
            surprisingly difficult operation.
        </p>

            FWIW, Zope 3 attempts to tackle virtually all of these matters, with
            the exception of SQL mapping. AFAICT, Zope 3 doesn't have O-R
            mapping in its goal set, however.
            <br />

            <br />
            Of course, you're probably aware that PEAK is also attempting to
            tackle these matters, but with robust handling of "legacy"
            databases, and schemas and forms that have complex constraint
            validation.
            <br />

            <br />
            Both Zope and PEAK already have nice MVC mechanisms, object
            publishers, and templating systems.
            <br />

            <br />
            Anyway, "sticking pieces together" won't cut it, IMO. You can cut
            pieces of wood from a tree, but you can't make a tree by hammering
            pieces of wood together. :)

            I've had a small amount of success using Cheetah, CherryPy and
            SQLObject together. The three products seem to complement one
            another quite well. In Phillip's terms, you can't make a new tree,
            but you can fashion some rather nice furniture. ;)

            Rails is certainly much different than Zope 3 or PEAK; the ambition
            is much lower, and the accompanying conceptual hurdles are also much
            lower. I don't know which has more potential; Zope 2 shows that
            merely building an integrated environment does not mean it will be
            good. Obviously both Zope 3 and PEAK are informed by those mistakes,
            but the basic vision hasn't changed; at the same time, Rails (and
            several other similar efforts) are a very different, and more
            modest, vision.

            Rails has some weaknesses, but your post is missing them, Ian.
            Several people have had the reaction "but what if you want to do
            more than simple scaffolding?" but it totally misses the point.
            Scaffolding is just a development aid to get things online quickly.
            You'd never use it as a finished product. Doing joins and more
            complex screens is still easy.
            <br />

            <br />
            The integration within Rails goes very deep, yet it retains
            flexibility. That's something that can't be achieved by sticking
            pieces together, as Phillip noted. If you want a Rails-like
            framework in Python, I suggest you get your hands dirty and start
            from scratch.

                <p>I am using Quixote and SQLObject with MySQL underneath.</p>

                    With the exception of session managemnt, which is lousy in
                    Quixote, this works pretty well. I build a HTML-layout with
                    an abstract Python class, coded in PTL. Every web page that
                    is using the template, is a subclass of that abstract class,
                    which results in structured, easy to maintain site. The
                    startup code was bad in Quixote 1.x but is much improved in
                    2.x, giving me the opportunity to switch from medusa during
                    development to apache + mod_scgi for deployment

                    I'm researching a framework for a code rewrite of a large
                    web application. I've been pointed at Rails and Zope. I have
                    no experience in either so I have a fresh perspective on
                    them. I haven't found much decent documentation on Zope 3.
                    There's plenty of it though. The whole design to me seems
                    sloppy and more like a dirty hack to encapsulate MVC and
                    other ideas. Zope does tout a larger user base and a more
                    extensive set of components. It isn't at all clear how
                    everything works in Zope due to the lack of any good
                    documentation. Now, Rails on the other hand is very well
                    documented and it is kept up to date. The Zope docs seems to
                    be rotting. Rails takes MVC and seems to shape itself to
                    that pattern. It's clear almost immediately how things work
                    and where to begin. I feel we could easily start using Rails
                    and all feel very comfortable in it. Zope on the other hand
                    seems to have a quite steep learning curve which I mostly
                    attribute to a lack of good documentation. Rails seems to
                    embody a newer style of web development whereas Zope has a
                    more legacy feel to it. Our project is quite large and is
                    funded for 12 years so I want something that won't need to
                    be rewritten anytime soon. Zope just doesn't have the
                    enormous forward momentum that Rails does right now. Rails
                    is only going to get better. Zope 3 is still stumbling
                    around trying to fix their previous problems with Zope 2. In
                    my opinion, Rails is the best framework I've seen thus far.
