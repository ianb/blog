                a while ago, I got it into my mind that I wanted to make
                something better, especially to be friendlier to test-driven
                development. Several other projects were recommended in the
                <a
                    class="reference"
                    href="http://blog.colorstudy.com/system/comments.py?u=0000001&amp;p=P11&amp;link=http://blog.colorstudy.com/ianb/weblog/2003/10/10.html%23P11"
                    >comments</a
                >, and I spent quite a while trying to use the Zope tester, but
                ultimately I found it unsatisfying. (Most of the time I couldn't
                get the Zope tester to find any of my tests, and when I did
                manage it I didn't understand why)
            </p>
            <p>
                To me the problem was that not enough was being delegated to the
                TestCase instances, so that people couldn't override enough on
                their own. This included the code to find and run tests.
            </p>
            <p>
                Anyway, after agonizing over the design for far too long, I've
                finally got something that feels (kind of) right to me:
                <a
                    class="reference"
                    href="http://formencode.org/docs/DataTest/README.html"
                    >DataTest</a
                >
                (<a
                    class="reference"
                    href="http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/formencode/DataTest-0.1.tar.gz?download"
                    >download</a
                >). The
                <a
                    class="reference"
                    href="http://formencode.org/docs/DataTest/README.html"
                    >README</a
                >
                describes the changes. Some of the features: (intended to be)
                compatible with
                <tt class="docutils literal"
                    ><span class="pre">unittest</span></tt
                >; tests can have multiple parameters, and each combination of
                parameters is its own selectable test instance; a test
                loader/runner that actively seeks out tests, and allows
                intelligent selection of tests. I have some
                <a
                    class="reference"
                    href="http://formencode.org/docs/DataTest/TODO.html"
                    >other ideas</a
                >
                for the tester as well (several of which are in other
                frameworks, but are actually easier than they seem at first).
            </p>
            <p>
                I haven't had a chance to actually use the tester for useful
                stuff yet. I plan to convert my
                <a class="reference" href="http://formencode.org">FormEncode</a>
                tests first, as that was a driving project (since it involves
                lots of data input and output).
            </p>
            <p>
                I'm very interested in comments or suggestions. I'm not
                confident of the design (even though I've already refactored the
                design several times), or of how well it addresses all the
                issues with test suites. But I still like it, and I think the
                code is relatively simple all considering, which is a good sign.

            Hmm, this sounds like a good feature for my Testipy framework...
