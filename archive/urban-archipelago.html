            I just read
            <a href="http://www.urbanarchipelago.com/">The Urban Archipelago</a
            >, a pro-urban, anti-exurban/rural screed. I love it, it's the most
            positive thing I've read yet in this post 11-02 world.
        </p>
        <p>
            When I tell someone where I call home, I always say Chicago, I've
            literally never said Illinois. I moved here because of the city, and
            I stay here because of the city; to me the rest of the state is just
            an insignificant appendage. That's not my ideology, it's just the
            reality of why I'm here.
        </p>
        <p>
            I read this essay, and the message I feel in it is
            <i>live in a community that shares your values</i> and
            <i>improve the place you live</i>. If your community doesn't share
            your values, then move - there's other places that do. We'll be
            happy to take you in. You don't have to move to Canada, there's many
            progressive cities instead. This cultural war is a war of
            demographics and population, let's make sure we have the most
            people, the smartest people, the most active people.
        </p>
        <p>
            That's not to say the city is without problems. But it's not a
            problem of values, so much as logistic. So we work on the logistics:
            transportation, affordable housing, an active economy, and an
            aesthetically pleasing environment. And a friendly disposition. It's
            not enough to make <i>just</i> our lives better; we have to make
            space for new people, we have to make it possible for people on the
            outside to envision themselves on the inside.
        </p>
        <p>
            And let's call the Republicans' bluff: let's downsize the Federal
            Government, let's get back to States' Rights. (Well hell, they
            aren't even bluffing anymore, but maybe we can still call them on
            it.) We can fund our own programs, and do it right; federal money is
            only worth it because they've already taken it from us. We'd do much
            better keeping it for ourselves and solving our own problems.
        </p>
        <p>
            This isn't a call for smaller government, just accountable and
            intelligent government. Cities are collective environments; we can't
            afford to ignore our neighbors, we don't have room for private
            infrastructure, and that would ruin the whole point of the city
            anyway. Government <i>can</i> be efficient; we need to look after
            the government that is closest to us, to make our communities the
            best they can be. I guess the cliche way to say it: living well is
            the best revenge.
        </p>
        <p>
            So go read
            <a href="http://www.urbanarchipelago.com/">the article</a>. And if
            you don't live in the city, start thinking about moving.
