        <div class="document">
            <p>
                In light of the recent Supreme Court rulings on the Ten
                Commandments, I thought it might be useful to look at them more
                closely. One of the arguments for putting the Ten Commandments
                in court houses is that they form a historical foundation for
                our laws. Let's look at that too...
            </p>
            <p>
                Well, the first confusion is that there are
                <a
                    class="reference"
                    href="http://www.positiveatheism.org/crt/whichcom.htm"
                    >many versions of the Ten Commandments</a
                >. I'll use the two distinct ones, starting with Exodus 34:
            </p>
            <blockquote>
                <ol class="arabic simple">
                    <li>
                        Thou shalt worship no other god (For the Lord is a
                        jealous god).
                    </li>
                    <li>Thou shalt make thee no molten gods.</li>
                    <li>
                        The feast of unleavened bread shalt thou keep in the
                        month when the ear is on the corn.

                    <li>All the first-born are mine.</li>

                        Six days shalt thou work, but on the seventh thou shalt
                        rest.

                    <li>
                        Thou shalt observe the feast of weeks, even of the first
                        fruits of the wheat harvest, and the feast of
                        ingathering at the year's end.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Thou shalt not offer the blood of my sacrifice with
                        leavened bread.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The fat of my feast shall not remain all night until the
                        morning.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The first of the first fruits of thy ground thou shalt
                        bring unto the house of the Lord thy God.
                    </li>
                    <li>Thou shalt not seethe a kid in its mother's milk.</li>

            <p>
                Hah, bet you didn't see that coming! While these laws are
                important in Judaism, most Christians don't seem to care about
                them at all, since like 100 A.D. or so. And what does
                <em>All the first-born are mine</em> mean? That's just creepy.
                Notably, none of these are reflected in even the slightest way
                in our laws. The Bible has two sets of commandments, though, the
                ones &quot;which Moses didst break&quot; and &quot;the words
                that were on the first&quot; that Moses did break. That he broke
                right before he
                <a
                    class="reference"
                    href="http://www.cforc.com/kjv/Exodus/32.html#27"
                    >killed three thousand people in the Lord's name</a
                >. Exodus is <em>so</em> fucked up; the God presented in Exodus
                is simply an evil god.
            </p>
            <p>
                Anyway, I digress. The Commandments I gave up there are
                &quot;the words that were on the first&quot;. Here's the ones
                Moses didst break (Exodus 20), and you'll have to to figure out
                for yourself how God could be so infallible as to think these
                two sets match:

                    <li>
                        Also Unconstitutional, both because of the established
                        religion and freedom of speach (both in the First

                    <li>And again.</li>
                    <li>
                        Well, there are laws to this effect (&quot;Blue
                        Laws&quot;). They are rather uncommon now. And frankly
                        they seem rather Unconstitutional as well, especially
                        seeing as we can't all agree on which day is the
                        Sabbath. Though it always surprised me that we nearly
                        all agree on seven days in the week. Except for those
                        wacky

                        (I think they worship on a 12 day cycle or something).

                    <li>
                        I don't know what a law like this would be like. It's
                        not <em>Unconstitutional</em>, but it's pretty
                        <em>unreasonable</em> to enforce.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        This is a law! Wow, I bet when God gave this to Moses it
                        was a pretty novel interpretation of morality!
                        Especially since he followed it up with a lot of
                        killing.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Has been illegal. Probably still is some places, but not
                        many. Its importance is still reflected in law (e.g.,
                        it's a justification for divorce).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        This is also a law! Again, a real shocker, without this
                        one we'd all be stealing everything to this day.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Well... not really a law. Under oath it's illegal. In
                        some other cases its illegal (e.g., slander). But mostly
                        not illegal.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Wow... so legal as to be practically privileged. Even if
                        it was, like 5 I can't see how it'd be enforced.
                    </li>

                    Awesome post, Ian - the God of Exodus is indeed way fucked

                    My only real comment is on #2 - no graven images. I just
                    want to say that you could argue that we're going to start
                    approaching that with the flag-burning amendment, if it ever
                    actually gets passed. Our flag is sacred -&gt; other flags
                    are evil is not that big a leap.
                </p>

                        Medicare and Social Security seem rather contrary to me;
                        the government is taking on a responsibility for the
                        elderly in lieu of children. It's certainly not
                        prescribed by any law (even though a law making parents
                        the responsibility of their children would be entirely
                        possible and constitutional).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Relatedly, the Amish don't pay Social Security, because
                        they <em>do</em> take responsibility for their elders,
                        and do not ask the government to support them in old
                        age. I assume they consider this a religious
                        prescription, since you don't get out of Social Security
                        payments based solely on good intentions. It's much like
                        they don't use insurance (again for religious reasons),
                        relying on their community to mitigate disasters.

                    Like WOW! I never thought that I would see the Commandments
                    listed with &quot;I am the Lord Your God who brought you out
                    of Egypt, out of the house of slavery&quot; as the first
                    Commandment anywhere outside of Messianic circles. Just to
                    remind you there are New Covenant believers that keep the
                    seventh day Sabbath and observe the first list of
                    commandments that you give. They are called the
                    &quot;Moadim&quot;, God's appointed times.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I also want to point out that God isn't terribly interested
                    in humanistic evaluations of what is moral and what isn't.
                    You refer to giving commandments then commanding Israel to
                    kill thousands. Life and death don't matter much. This was
                    done to purify the land where His name was to be written.

                My personal law is &quot;always doubt of any list with TEN items
                -- there's probably something missing or something extra&quot;.
                If we had 12 fingers, there would be 12 commandments... :)
                <br /><br />
                An getting even more off-topic: do you know why some people
                cross the number 7 (for example, the Lucida Blackletter font:
                http://www.fontage.com/pages/lblack.html)? Because when Moses
                announced the seventh commandment, &quot;You shall not commit
                adultery&quot;, everybody said &quot;Cross the seven! Cross the
                seven!&quot;. (It's funnier in portuguese...)

                    where he develops the idea [and this is a radical
                    paraphrase] that the forgiving, healing sort of Love that
                    Christians talk about from the New Testament standpoint, and
                    the (apparently) &quot;evil god&quot; of Exodus, where

                    Excellent! A number of years ago there was an essay over at
                    the Internet Infidels (infidels.org at the time, haven't
                    been there in a while) that compared the 10Cs with the 10
                    moral precepts of Solon the Athenian, and showed how much
                    closer our system of law is to Solon than any subset of
                    commandments presented by Moses.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I haven't decided yet if this is a lost cause or not. There
                    are just so many stupid, stupid Americans who think that
                    there's some evil atheist conspiracy to remove the 10Cs from
                    our courtrooms, as if they are there by default, without
                    realizing that it's their own evil theist conspiracy to
                    inject them into the courtrooms in the first place.

                    The opening phrase of the first ammendment clearly limits
                    the ammendment's scope to Congress and the making of laws.
                    How does this ammendment have any bearing on whether a court
                    or any other public building can display the ten
                    commandments? It's not as if Congress has passed a law that
                    requires all courts in the republic to display the ten
                    commandments--that would clearly be unconstitutional.

                    in particular, to not legitimatize religious right drivel by

                    I was going to respond to this message with a longwinded
                    explenation on how that information is wrong completly,
                    atleast from a Orthodox Jewish point of view. But then I
                    came to a few conclusions: 1. Arguing religion over the web
                    is pointless 2. I actually read the website which you
                    quoted, and if you take your information from there then I
                    should be arguing with your methods not your conclusions 3.
                    You probably don't care enought to get into long winded
                    explanations from a religion which you probably hardly will
                    ever get exposed to
                </p>
                <p>
                    I just want to point out that from a religious Orthodox Jew
                    that your post could of been alot more accurate (Rule of
                    thumb, the bible makes alot more sense if you read the
                    original Hebrew Jewish version (which has been verified to
                    be accurate except for some very small differences with a
                    Bible found from more then a thousand years ago), instead of
                    re-re-retranslated and 'fixed up' Christian version (I don't
                    mean to be disrespectful to Christians, but the translations
                    were done by man and man isn't perfect by definition).
                    Another example is this line: &quot;While these laws are
                    important in Judaism&quot; which is incorrect when stated
                    upon the first set of the ten commandments which are not
                    true. The 'real' ten commandments in the original bible are
                    stated in the link you brought and are very consistant.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Anyway, This is way more then I wanted to write anyhow. If
                    you actually care fell free to email me if you want to talk
                    about the subject.

                        Well, I would argue that the original Hebrew version is
                        not what's really up for debate. It's not the
                        <em>idea</em> of the Ten Commandments they are putting
                        up, it is the Ten Commandments in the King James Version
                        of The Bible. If they put the original Hebrew up...
                        well, they didn't do that, did they? So it's true that
                        there's many translations and interpretations. There are
                        people that argue that the KJV is the purest
                        undisputable truth. They don't argue this based on
                        anything, but they argue it...
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Anyway, I'm certainly not very educated on this stuff,
                        but then I'm not seeking out truth in The Bible, so my
                        motivation wanes quickly. I'm just pointing out some
                        absurdities in how other people are using it. Jewish
                        interpretations of the Ten Commandments might be more
                        apropos if Jews were trying to get monuments errected in
                        courthouses. But it's Protestant Christians (of the
                        variety who like KJV) who are trying to get them
                        errected. And these are the Ten Commandments they go by.
                        Or don't go by, depending on the chapter. If they wanted
                        to put it up in a historical and theological context, I
                        might not mind at all... but again, that's not kind of
                        monument we're talking about.

                    This is really simple--there is only one version. The Ten
                    Commandments are listed twice: in Exodus 20 and Deuteronomy
                    5, but they are the same. Exodus 34 is not a second list of
                    commandments (there's no list!), it's simply a renewal of
                    the Covenant that God made with the nation of Israel. The
                    reason this renewal was significant was because Moses had
                    not yet reached the bottom of the mountain with his fresh
                    set of tablets before he saw the israelites worshiping
                    Jehovah by means of a Golden Calf (that's breaking the
                    second commandment).
                </p>
                <p>
                    The article &quot;Which Ten Commandments?&quot; that you
                    referenced is misleading: Catholics and Protestants DO have
                    separate versions of the Ten Commandments, but only because
                    Christians read the Ten Commandments from the Bible, and
                    Catholics read it from their Catechism, which is derrived
                    from, but not the same as the Bible's account. There is no
                    difference between the Jewish and Christian versions of The
                    Ten Commandments because they both read from the Hebrew
                    text, or an English translation of the Hebrew text in the
                    Pentateuch.

                        Another important thing you don't seem to know, is that
                        (for judaism/jews) these commandments are just 10
                        commandments in 613. They're not really more important,
                        they're just the first (and the only) ones that were
                        spoken to all of the people. What was referred to, by
                        saying that commandments are on a historical basis for
                        US law, may be more about these 613 laws, not just the
                        10 you referred to. You can look at
                        <a

                        >
                        for example. Please read the Talmud to see what they
                        really meant with 'law'. And as the previous poster
                        said, there's just one version. The link you put is
                        silly in the sense that it places catholic, protestant
                        and hebrew versions as different but parallel things.
                        That's not right. All the versions are derived from the
                        original one, the hebrew version. That's the
                        incompetence of the scribes that made them different.

                        Many people hate dubbed films, so why do people argue on
                        transcriptions of transcriptions of transcriptions? Read
                        the original (or at least the oldest version)!

                    I you are measuring biblical law against the law of a
                    secular country like the United States and saying that the
                    U.S. law is right, you've got you're facts mixed up.
                    Biblical law is higher than any U.S. law could ever be. If
                    the U.S. law does not agree with Bible you should obey the
                    Bible over the U.S. law. And you're pretty hung up on the
                    unconstitutional.
