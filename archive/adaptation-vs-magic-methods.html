</div><h1>Adaptation vs. Magic Methods</h1>
 <p>

There are lots of magic methods in Python.  Some of them are
especially magic, hooking into the underlying object model -- methods
like <tt>__getattr__</tt>, or its newer cousins like <tt>__get__</tt>
(used in <a href="http://users.rcn.com/python/download/Descriptor.htm">descriptors</a>),
or <tt>__getattribute__</tt>.

<p>

I'll refer to a different set of magic attributes, things like
<tt>__len__</tt>, <tt>__nonzero__</tt>, <tt>__gt__</tt>, etc.  These
are generally ways for functions to allow objects to provide overrides
-- <tt>len(x)</tt> calls <tt>x.__len__()__</tt>, <tt>a &gt; b</tt>
calls <tt>a.__gt__(b)</tt>, etc.  Lots of these functions also perform
some other fallbacks -- if <tt>__gt__</tt> is not found, then
<tt>__cmp__</tt> is tried, and finally the comparison is done based on
some obscure comparison of class names, or IDs or something.  When
testing a value for truth, <tt>__nonzero__</tt> is called, then if
that's not found <tt>__len__</tt> (to check if it is zero length) then
if that's not found the object is considered "true".

<p>

A lot of these methods exist, both inside base Python, the standard
library, and extension modules (like ZODB).  One could argue that they
are a sign of a hackish object model in Python -- Ruby is certainly an
instance of a language that does not do this sort of thing.  But by
using functions (or operators) instead of directly using methods, they
do allow naive objects to be handled easily.

<p>

It occurred to me -- specifically when thinking about the <a href="http://www.python.org/doc/current/lib/typeiter.html"><tt>__iter__</tt></a>
special method -- that many of these are examples of <a href="http://python.org/peps/pep-0246.html">adaptation</a> (I've been
using <a href="http://peak.telecommunity.com/PyProtocols.html">PyProtocols</a>,
which is well documented and concisely distributed).  In the case of
<tt>__iter__</tt> we are adapting an object to the iterator interface.
<tt>__nonzero__</tt> (and friends) adapts to the boolean interface,
and so on.  <tt>v.__class__</tt> could become <tt>adapt(v, IType)</tt>
(since classes are of type <tt>type</tt>).

<p>

In a strange sort of way, this could make things more
context-sensitive, like Perl.  Unlike Perl the context is explicit
(using explicit interfaces, and adapting the object explicitly with
<tt>adapt()</tt>), but like Perl an object could be used and reused in
different contexts to provide different kinds of information.
Adaptation to an iterator is easy enough to consider -- how would
adapation work for <tt>__len__</tt>?  Would we create a
<tt>ILength</tt> interface, to distinguish the unique semantics (but
not type!) of length?  (Do we need to start annotating our numbers
with units to handle this?)

<p>

Following this further (too far?) does adaptation start to replace
traversal?  Instead of <tt>out.write('text')</tt> do we say
<tt>adapt(out, IWriter)('text')</tt>?  We quickly find ourselves using
a wildly different object model, and a different notion of
object-orientation.

 Hmmm...  so *you're* the reason Guido's uncomfortable with how far people might take adaptation.  ;)
<br />

<br />
The v.__class__ example is...  I hate to say wrong, but actually it is.  If you have an object that's a type already, you'd get back the same object.  So, adapting an object to its type doesn't make sense.
<br />

<br />
In general, I don't think you can make a slots -> interface mapping of the sort you've laid out.  I'd be more likely to say that certain slots or combinations could be described by interfaces, and that Python uses the slot presence rather than an adaptation mechanism to find them.
<br />

<br />
It's true that slots like __int__, __str__, and __nonzero__ are for type conversion, and therefore could be treated in terms of adaptation, though.
<br />

<br />
And the traversal stuff is also too far out there...  *why* would you use that style, when it's so much harder to read?
<br />

<br />
Ah well, people are going to experiment with this sort of thing in their "wild youth", but hopefully they'll settle down into the "adaptation as type-casting" model where it best fits.  :)

 Oh come on, PJE, let's have some fun and shake up the establishment. :-)
<br />

<br />
When you're working with some arbitrary object, you don't want to know anything about its implementation.  Using methods instead of attributes isolates knowledge of data structures, but you still have to know what interfaces the object supports.  Adaptation lets you abstract away even the knowledge of an object's interfaces.
<br />

<br />
The important consideration is how often you work with arbitrary objects, as opposed to objects under your direct control.  In Zope, it turns out that you end up working with arbitrary objects very frequently.  In Zope 3, most code is going to be completely agnostic of the actual interfaces objects support.
<br />

<br />
Just as in days past we programmers made the transition from working directly with data structures to calling methods, maybe in the future, we'll transition to using adapters instead of calling methods.  And it could be that programmers will flock to the first language that makes adaptation easier than any other language.
<br />

<br />
Here is a syntax I've been toying with:
<br />

<br />
  foo.IWrite::write(bar)
<br />

<br />
This is equivalent to "adapt(foo, IWrite).write(bar)", but hopefully it more clearly expresses that you can think of "write" as a method of nearly any object.
<br />

<br />
The double colon is nearly borrowed from C++ and XPath, but a lot of Python programmers don't know that stuff.  Some other possibilities:
<br />

<br />
  foo.[IWrite]write(bar)
<br />

<br />
  foo.write@IWrite(bar)
<br />

<br />
  (foo as IWrite).write(bar)
<br />

<br />
Ok, after writing them out, I think the last suggestion is by far the most readable.  It requires parentheses, but that could actually be a benefit, since it's the only suggestion that lets you store the adapted object in a variable:
<br />

<br />
  baz = foo as IWrite
<br />
  baz.write(bar)
<br />

<br />
The "as" keyword could be implemented through an __adapt__ magic name.
<br />

<br />
I should write about this on comp.lang.python and see how well it floats. :-)

 I like "as", reads just right.  foo.IWrite::write(v) seems all wrong -- foo::IWrite.write(v) seems much better.  But, wait, that matches my dislike of how you wanted to use : in path expressions too -- I guess I think of :: as a harder separator than you.
<br />

<br />
But it doesn't really matter, "as" is perfect.  Of course, introducing syntax for a feature that doesn't have a canonical or standard implementation might be premature ;)
