            <p>Today, iterable strings. E.g.:</p>
            <pre class="literal-block">
&gt;&gt;&gt; for item in &quot;list&quot;: print item

                While this is the occasional enabler of a cute answer on
                comp.lang.python, in reality this is a total non-feature; no one
                needs to iterate over strings.
            </p>
            <p>
                But it's worse than that! Who among us has not accidentally
                passed in a string where a list is expected, then puzzled over
                the odd results that occur when the function thinks it has
                received a list of single-character values? This has been the
                source of great annoyance for me. One of the important design
                features of a dynamically typed language is that operations not
                be ambiguous. If two different types of objects have the method
                <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">foo</span></tt
                >, that's okay -- if they both do the conceptually same thing!
                If they both have a method by the same name, and they do
                conceptually different things, then you set yourself up for the
                Dark Side of dynamic typing -- when type errors silently
                insinuate themselves into the depths of your program, resulting
                in disconnected errors, or even worse in no error but incorrect
                results. In this case, iteration is supported by strings, but
                strings are not collections (at least, that's not how anyone
                uses them), and they shouldn't implement something that makes
                them pretend to be collections.
            </p>
            <p>
                The reason why strings do this is probably because it seemed
                natural. Especially before Python had a formal notion of
                iteration,
                <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">for</span></tt>
                used to just use
                <tt class="docutils literal"
                    ><span class="pre">__getitem__</span></tt
                >
                with an increasing index -- and strings have a
                <tt class="docutils literal"
                    ><span class="pre">__getitem__</span></tt
                >
                which returns characters (which are themselves strings, thus
                being an infinitely recursively iterative structure). It would
                have taken a special rule to keep strings from being iterable.
                And such a rule should have been written, but it wasn't. Now
                that
                <tt class="docutils literal"
                    ><span class="pre">__iter__</span></tt
                >
                covers this specific instance, such a rule could more easily be
                implemented:
            </p>
            <pre class="literal-block">
class goodstr(str):
    def __iter__(self):
        raise TypeError, &quot;iteration over a non-sequence&quot;
</pre
            >
            <p>
                Of course, this string subclass does me no good, because no one
                (including myself) would bother to use it. Maybe in Python 3...
                though I'd be curious -- I suspect if this was changed even now,
                very little code would be effected, because iterating over
                strings just doesn't make much sense, though
                <tt class="docutils literal"
                    ><span class="pre">list(s)</span></tt
                >
                is probably more common than using a string in a
                <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">for</span></tt>
                loop (e.g.,
                <tt class="docutils literal"
                    ><span class="pre">urllib.quote</span></tt
                >), and works by way of iterability.

            But Strings _are_ iterable. They are just a sequence of chars, but
            they are sequences. Everybody used to languages from the Lisp family
            or from Smalltalk will agree :-)
            <br />

            <br />
            If you just keep in mind that Strings are just sequences of chars,
            you don't see any ambiguity. Passing in the wrong types to functions
            is something else - that has much more to do with people unwilling
            to use the nice assert statement than with language problems :-)

            I just used iterating over a string yesterday to walk through a
            string representing a potential Hardware Address (aka MAC address)
            one digit at a time. I was checking for valid digits. I had a regex
            solution working, but I always look for ways to avoid them when
            possible.
            <br />

            <br />
            So yeah, I think they're useful, but I don't know if I really "need"
            them or not. In this case, I thought it was the easiest to
            understand.

            What about iterating over a string to make sure all the characters
            are in a certain charset?
            <br />

            <br />
            Though I'd personally just do a try/except ... seems more Pythonic.

            Georg, Joe: yes, a string is sometimes useful to see as a sequence
            of characters, though that's relatively uncommon. It's much more
            likely that a string is an atomic entity, as when it's used as an
            identifier, or a sequence of non-character strings, like a sequence
            of words, or a sequence of colon-delimited hex-encoded numbers (a
            MAC address). Python sure could use a standard idiom for
            tokenizing... but that's another issue.
            <br />

            <br />
            And unlike many other languages, Python does not have a character
            object, so strings are not a sequence of characters. They are a
            sequence of... strings? It just doesn't make much sense. (I
            <i>do</i> think that it was the right decision to avoid character
            objects -- in part because I don't think it's a particularly useful
            metaphor)

            how about len(str)? That's one that I have used quite often. And
            it's a sequence-type behaviour, and is considered a basic string
            operation.
            <br />

            <br />
            Maybe that is the pain of this -- we are used to standard string
            operations (from C, anyway), so they needed to be implemented
            somehow. The implementation may not have been the best way, but at
            least we have all the operations that most languages have.
            <br />

            <br />
            That said, I've also known the pain of accidently iterating over a
            string instead of a list, and seen the pain that causes. The
            debugging for it can suck.

            I agree with the original point, and I can well imagine myself using
            slice/array notation and indexes with strings rather than directly
            iterating over the "characters", although I typically avoid
            character manipulation and try and use string methods wherever
            possible. Indeed, because of various stated benefits of using lists
            for such manipulations, one could legitimately argue that people
            should convert to lists, do their stuff, and then convert back to
            strings afterwards, all without having "string iteration". Moreover,
            if one does anything to a string when iterating over it, one has to
            store the transformed characters somewhere other than the original
            string anyway, due to its immutability.
            <br />

            <br />
            If you consider the C-style motivation for this feature, which is
            iterating over a character array using pointers, I'd claim that such
            antics borders on the "un-Pythonic", although that claim might only
            stick because of the primitive syntax in C for iterating in such a
            way: the ++ and -- operators. But non-const character arrays in C
            are at least mutable and do justify such trickery when being
            modified in place.

            I use "if a in b" a lot to test if a is the substring of b and I
            find it's very readable and convenient. I think it's probably one
            benefit of iterable string.

            <br />

            <br />
            But that's not iterating the string, it's testing for membership
            (__contains__).
            <br />

            <br />
            The point isn't that strings don't have list-like properties, but
            that iterating over strings is a Python "feature" that gives no real
            benefits, yet leads to common coding errors.

            Really hope they dont change it, at least four of the programs i've
            writen lattly would need editing and end up looking less tidy (maybe
            ;)).

            <br />
            I just really like it, seems natural i guess. And it makes it very
            easy to do something for every char in a string (not that
            list(string) is hard, but then thats not the point).

                <p>
                    I've been using Py for two years now - admittedly, not very
                    long - but as far as I'm concerned it makes perfect sense to
                    have strings an iterable container, and it's a nonsense to
                    suggest otherwise.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As you mention, a string is a list of single character
                    values, thus a string and a list are conceptually the same
                    thing. While in all cases they may not be literally
                    identical, for the most part they are and Python takes
                    advantage of this by design.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Much of the Py code I author is responsible for data
                    verifcation, and often involves iteration over a string
                    sequence, so it's a feature I'd not happily lose,
                    particularly when your argument stems from the fact that it
                    simply makes programmer error more annoying.
