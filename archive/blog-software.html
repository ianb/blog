            <p>
                If I was to change blog software (because this software sucks --
                I can say that, because I wrote it)... then what software should
                I change to? I was getting stressed about the change, but then I
                realized I deliberately put
                <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">.html</span></tt>
                at the end of all my URLs just so I could dump everything to a
                static version, so I shouldn't be too worried. (And then I still
                need to fix up the redirects that I let break over the years and
                clean out spam and catch anything I've accidentally deleted
                and... oh bother)
            </p>
            <p>Anyway, I'd like:</p>
            <ul class="simple">
                <li>
                    Threaded comments. I think threaded comments have
                    substantially improved the quality of discussion.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Some spam protection. (I've decided I like OpenID in
                    particular, but CAPTCHAs are more friendly in a way)
                </li>
                <li>
                    Some pleasant input format. Restructured Text or pluggable
                    preferred. I write <em>about</em> code, and not all formats
                    work well for that (including many WYSIWYG editors). Poor
                    Python Blogger users, with their crushed whitespace :-/
                </li>
                <li>
                    Static publishing or pretty URLs that can translate to
                    static publishing is cool. Since that's the one thing that I
                    realize will save my butt with this software, it would be
                    nice to keep that going.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                I don't actually care <em>that</em> much about the language of
                implementation. I have too damn many projects, which is why this
                software has been so neglected, and I don't want another
                project. Suggestions? Just jump on the WordPress bandwagon?
            </p>
            <p>
                Whatever it is, I know I won't keep any of those stupid narrow
                column templates (no offense to all you people who have kept the
                stupid narrow column template ;). It looked kind of
                sophisticated a year or two ago; now it is just an annoying
                waste of space. And the way comments get strewn way down the
                page adds to the ghettoization of comments in many blogs. And
                none of that stupid whitespace in the line spacing either. The
                rise of RSS and aggregators has shown us that uniform
                presentation is a more pleasant reading experience, so I plan to
                let browser defaults control much of the look of my site.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you are curious about why this software sucks... I blame it
                on my ill-advised attempt to avoid a database. Flat files suck.
                BDB sucks more. I used both here. But the
                <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">.html</span></tt>
                extensions are awesome!

                    I think home-grown blog software nicely illustrates the fact
                    that public pressure and users actually and significantly
                    improve the quality of a given software. (And I am not
                    saying that you don't understand this, btw. I am sure you
                    do.) There rarely is anything too demanding to implement in
                    a blog software, but the sheer amount of features you need
                    to implement is overwhelming. Implementing your own blog
                    software starts with the usual &quot;I can do this
                    myself&quot; and ends with &quot;I am tired of implementing
                    yet another must-have feature.&quot;

                <p>Hi Ian,</p>
                <p>
                    While we're at it: I noticed several times that the
                    availability of your blog also was very bad (to me it was
                    something like 25% of my tries this site wasn't available).
                    Was that also due to your &quot;attempt to avoid
                    database&quot; or were there other reasons. You - as someone
                    who is quite exposed on the Python web development front -
                    shouldn't have such a bad availability (as this can also
                    fuel the anti-python fud). If this is the fault of your
                    hosting company you should obviously change to another one.

                        It's mostly the software that's causing the problem.
                        There's been a few times when the Subversion server
                        (previously under the same Apache instance) caused some
                        collatoral damage, but mostly the software itself.
                        There's two scaling problems the software has:
                        everything is kept in flat files, but the actual data
                        model is fairly relational. And there's now quite a few
                        posts and comments (about 8000, I guess), and some of
                        the operations require scanning the contents of those
                        files (not many, but a couple). To help that situation,
                        I then foolishly thought I'd keep indexing information
                        in a BDB database. That's fairly fast, but maintaining
                        indexes in an ad hoc fashion is a horrible idea -- it's
                        hard, and you accomplish nothing you couldn't do better
                        with a more general system. And BDB does not operate
                        well under load, especially with concurrent access. That
                        ended up being the biggest problem, with the process
                        just freezing up regularly (usually with no error, it
                        simply stops responding and won't shut down properly).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Right now I don't think I use anything in this blog that
                        I use regularly elsewhere.

                    I like it because of the ease of setting up new blogs and

                        Perl would be fine -- then I wouldn't even be tempted to

                        Has anyone else noticed that there was all sorts of buzz
                        about MT, and lots of blogs using it, until it changed
                        its licensing? Now I almost never hear about it; zero
                        buzz, and proportionally it seems like a fairly marginal
                        piece of software. Well, really it's that the hosted
                        options have become incredibly dominant; and even though
                        MT was never open source, people in the open source
                        community were suddenly reminded of that (and left in
                        droves) when they changed their licensing, and those are
                        the blogs I tend to read.

                    I use it myself and can say, it has nearly every feature you

                    <a class="reference" href="http://www.s9y.org/"
                        >http://www.s9y.org/</a
                    >
                </p>
                <p>
                    And not caring about the language of implementation is
                    important, since it's PHP ;)

                        One thing I realize now is that software that supports
                        XMLRPC (or better Atom) posting can support whatever
                        client-side rendering I want (but not editing, which is
                        OK). So I could compose in reST, then have something
                        that renders to to HTML and uploads it as a post. Which
                        is good enough for me (though I also hope that at least
                        <em>something</em> reasonable is available for
                        commenters -- seeing how hard it is to talk about code
                        in the Radio commenting environments shows how difficult
                        that can make things).

                        <p>Hi Ian,</p>
                        <p>
                            I wrote a little script to post comments to my
                            wordpress blog from emacs (or whatever editor you
                            might use), except that I used textile as a text
                            formatter. I imagine there's a python module for
                            rest, so you should be able to use it with it.
                            Here's the URL:

                        The features page on Serendipity doesn't mention it, but
                        I notice on their blog that they have .html extensions
                        and threaded comments. And a good number of interesting
                        plugins, like GeSHI, and input plugins like Textile
                        (which, while not my favorite, I'm sure I can adapt to).
                        So far Serendipity is looking like the top runner.

                        I have tried a number of the PHP based blog software
                        products. WordPress wins hands down. Serendipity was
                        runner up, but it just does not have the large community

                    I'd either go with WP -- well-established, open source, and
                    requiring little or no hacking -- or plunge in and write a
                    Paste-deployable blogging app yourself. I have a feeling
                    that there's some demand for solid, extensible Python
                    blogware right now. You might not care about that itself,
                    but it would also inevitably drive interest in (and
                    understanding of) Paste itself.

                        Typo on principle or anything. I notice there was a

                        -- that disappoints me. Maybe because I talk about
                        fairly technical things, I've never felt bothered when
                        there's been discussion in the comments. Discouraging
                        discussion by making it hard to follow hardly seems like
                        a constructive practice.

                    Hmmm.... well Firedrop2 is a nice clientside blog manager.
                    It supports ReST markup and generates static html. You'd
                    have to hack it to produce the type of URLs you want, but
                    that should be easy.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Being static it <em>doesn't</em> have a built in comment
                    solution. You could add that with a server side web-app.
                    I've considered doing it myself. That means not necessarily
                    having comments on the same page as the entry though (except
                    through includes or javascript perhaps). This may kill the
                    idea for you. :-s

                        Static publishing of dynamic content (e.g., publishing
                        SSI or PHP files) could make inlining of comments from
                        another system fairly easy. My only worry would be that
                        the result would have all the complexities of
                        <em>both</em> a fully dynamic and fully static system. I
                        think the general architecture -- splitting posting from
                        commenting, among other possible splits (e.g., splitting
                        feeds into

                            What do you think about static publishing of an
                            entry that uses AJAX to grab dynamic comments? Sure,
                            it's two calls back to the server, instead of one,
                            but at least one of those calls (and perhaps both,
                            if the software was written cleverly) could be
                            served directly from apache, no Python needed...

                    You can leverage the blog app from the djangoproject.com
                    site and get your own blog running in about 5 lines of
                    python. I know you don't want another project, and this
                    wouldn't be completely prepackaged with everything you want,
                    but it's really fun and easy to get up and running, and
                    simple to customize (for those things like threaded
                    comments, spam protection, and pleasant input that a given
                    prepackaged solution won't have all of).

                    unfortunately, the code that powers thraxil.org isn't really
                    in a releasable state at the moment. there's too much
                    hard-coded in right now and it relies on a few additional
                    &quot;micro-apps&quot; beyond Tasty that haven't been
                    released yet. unfortunate because it covers pretty much all
                    your stated requirements.
                </p>
                <p>
                    it also went through a phase where it stored everything in
                    text files on the filesystem with BDB indices and published
                    statically (making very clever use of apache SSIs) so i know
                    what you're talking about with the issues there. eventually
                    i broke down and rewrote it with SQLObject (against
                    PostgreSQL) and cherrypy serving pages dynamically (but
                    using memcached on a few bottlenecks). currently, i'm
                    porting it to TurboGears and trying to turn it into
                    something that other people might be able to install and use
                    on their servers in the process. don't hold your breath
                    though. i've still got a few issues that i'm not sure how
                    i'm going to solve.

                    I use PyBloxsom with the PyMarkdown plugin and I've been
                    very happy. When I had to convert all of my posts out of MT
                    into something else, PyMarkdown was very helpful with
                    formatting, etc. I picked PyBloxsom over Wordpress and
                    others because I realized that I really hated writing posts
                    in a textarea form. I preferred to use my usual editor, and
                    with Markdown, I can do simple formatting without any
                    problem. (I would think this would be a huge plus when
                    trying to post code, which Markdown handles very well.) I
                    use PyBloxsom's static generation feature, so when I'm done
                    editing, I just &quot;build&quot; the site and RSS, indices,
                    etc. are all updated. (And if you do decide to make any
                    changes, the code is compact and in python. And no
                    database!)
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you really want threaded comments, or comments at all, I
                    think it's better to outsource them to a company. Spam
                    filtering is a huge pain, and gets worse the longer you have
                    site. Let someone else handle it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I've tried Textile, still use MoveableType for GB, and
                    WordPress. They all drove me nuts. Using emacs and a couple
                    of simple shell scripts didn't, and that's the best way
                    forward I think.
