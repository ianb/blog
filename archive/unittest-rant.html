        <h1>Unittest Rant</h1>
        <p>
            I don't like the <tt>unittest</tt> module. I'm just starting to
            really do test-driven development (takes a while to catch on to),
            and I find <tt>unittest</tt> to be obnoxious and highly
            under-featured. Am I missing something?
        </p>

        <p>
            For instance, I often want to be able to test data sets, i.e., a
            bunch of inputs with expected outputs (or expected errors). This is
            a pain in the butt. It's easy enough to use a <tt>for</tt> loop and
            iterate over the data, but that's bad for test driven development --
            I want to see progress right away, I don't want my test to bomb on
            the first failure.
        </p>

        <p>So, I make a subclass of <tt>TestCase</tt>, maybe like:</p>

        <pre>
class DecodeTest(unittest.TestCase):
    def __init__(self, input, output):
        self.input = input
        self.output = output
    def test(self):
        self.assertEqual(decode(input), output)
</pre
        >

        OK, so it's annoying to create this class since it seems like an obvious
        need in testing, but once I've done it I can move on. Except I have to
        collect these all into suites and add them to the system. And once I've
        done that all my tests are essentially anonymous -- I can run a
        particular suite, but I can't run a particular input/output test.

        <p>
            Probably the issue here is that <tt>unittest.main</tt> is stupid.
            You can't add options (e.g., your own verbosity hooks), you can't
            easily indicate what tests you want to do... it's just dumb and not
            extensible.
        </p>

        <p>
            The features <tt>unittest</tt> <i>does</i> have are things like
            pluggable loggers, so you can have graphical output. Who cares?
            Maybe other people are more motivated by pretty lights, but
            personally I am more motivated by reducing the tedium of writing
            tests. I'm okay with writing the tests -- I like TDD, really -- but
            I've yet to hear anyone say they really like writing tests.
        </p>

        <p>
            But you can't get around it -- tests are tedious, because you have
            to think of the corner cases, the possible combinations of usage,
            etc. At least let us get rid of the boilerplate!
            <tt>unittest</tt> just feels like a lot of boilerplate, and methods
            like <tt>assertEqual</tt> are useful but not compelling.
        </p>

        <p>
            I gotta find a new way to do tests. <tt>doctest</tt> is too minimal
            -- I do need setup and teardown (but not setUp and tearDown -- I'm
            sorry, but this is English, "setup" and "teardown" are two words,
            not four). I would just write my own, but someone else out there
            must have cared enough to make something Pythonic and convenient...
        </p>

            would find useful. If I agree, I might add them. :-)

            I wrote Testipy because unittest got in my way a few times, so I
            decided to make my own little testing framework. I'm using it now
            for some of my personal projects.

            I'm agreed about the cruft in these unit testing frameworks. When
            it's just easier to write a test "main program" and to use shell
            scripts to make sense of the results, these frameworks don't really
            seem to be hitting the spot.
            <br />

            <br />
            And I'm totally in agreement about the hypothetical graphical
            progress bar cruft.

            instead of unittest. A useful feature is that it can optionally do
            code coverage, so you can quickly see which branches or functions
            aren't being exercised by the tests.

            In general I agree that the feature set is a little thin in the
            stock module, but there is enough to get started writing tests
            quickly. I think it depends on your perspective too. I use Python
            for functional/system testing of other sytems (not written in
            Python), and all my previous test harnesses have been centered
            around data-driven test drivers (along the lines of your DecodeTest
            example). If you look at the 'common' examples of unit testing
            today, with JUnit for example, you almost never see it used that
            way.
            <br />

            <br />
            I did a couple of things. I made a base TestCase class for
            data-driven tests. The parameters are passed in via __init__
            (exactly like your DecodeTest). There's a matching SuiteBuilder that
            can read various table formats (ODBC db tables, excel spreadsheets,
            csv files, etc) that is used to instantiate each test. Each column
            in the table is a different param (input,output for your example),
            and you just add any additional columns as needed. For example, I
            generally have a 'description' column that gets passed to all tests.
            That get used to change the the result of shortDescription(), so the
            tests are no longer 'anonymous'. At that point, adding new tests for
            a particular case is just a matter of adding another line to a
            spreadsheet (or record in a db table, whatever). Your suite builder
            can use the extra columns to pick out a single test, or filter out
            some number of them. Maybe unittest could have provided some of that
            out-of-the-box, but it really wasn't that much work to tack on.

            1. You don't need suites. Just add:
            <br />

            <br />
            if __name__ == '__main__': unittest.main()
            <br />

            <br />
            at the end of your file, and you can run the script and it'll find
            all the tests and automatically run them.
            <br />

            <br />
            2. assertEquals is useful. The reason is, if it fails, you get to
            see what two values were, whereas "assert x == y" won't display the
            difference. Also you should be writing multiple test cases per
            class, not one, and using setUp and tearDown. Passing info for tests
            in __init__ shouldn't be done. Each test should set it up itself, or
            if its for all tests in the class, use setUp.
            <br />

            <br />
            3. It is kinda limited. Twisted ended up writing an API compatible
            system that is more powerful in many ways (and customized to our
            needs), and has a command line test running tool, so you can say
            "trial twisted.test" and it runs all tests in the modules in that
            package. Zope3 has written a similar commandline tool for python's
            unittest.

            Zope's test.py driver addresses some of the issues you raised. I
            agree that unittest's main() isn't very useful and that unittest as
            a whole is hard to extend or customize.

            <b>Itamar:</b> I know you can loop over the input, use setUp and
            tearDown, etc. But it's not very convenient. Take the example from
            <a
                href="http://www.faqs.org/docs/diveintopython/roman_divein.html#roman.divein"

            -- it tests a bunch of known integer to roman numeral conversions.
            The unit test isn't much of a unit, because the first conversion
            that fails causes the entire conversion test to fail. So you don't
            see that ten of the conversions worked, but five didn't. If one
            fails, you don't get to see if any of the later ones failed. Not a
            big deal in roman numerals, but that's a trivial example. When you
            are working through corner cases one by one, it's nice to be able to
            see and rerun each failure individually, and
            <tt>unittest</tt> doesn't give that sort of granularity. (I don't
            want to define 100 methods to test 100 possible input/output
            combinations either)
            <br />

            <br />
            <b>Chris:</b> yes, I end up adding this functionality in subclasses.
            Unfortunately it doesn't work well with <tt>unittest.main</tt>. As
            Jeremy notes (and I tried to imply) unittests that take arguments to
            their <tt>__init__</tt> don't have proper names (even arbitrary
            names), and collecting them for <tt>main()</tt> is unintuitive. They
            work, and maybe that means that <tt>unittest.TestCase</tt> is a fine
            class (if not perfect), but these instances don't fit into the
            system well.
            <br />

            <br />
            Anyway, thanks all for the suggestions. I'm downloading them and it
            looks like there's some good stuff in these.

            I've had some success with <b>dynamic tests</b>, for example in my

            The trick is to define self-stocking descendants of

            > There's no credibility when you complain even about the method
            names' case.
            <br />

            <br />
            Why not? what would you say if the method was called sEtuP?
            <br />
            setup is one word in english. So the complaint is very legitimate.
            <br />

            <br />
            Another big complaint is its OOP only interface:
            <br />

            <br />
            In many testing scenarios I simply do not want
            classes/methods/inheritance/etc
            <br />

            <br />
            what I want is this:
            <br />

            <br />
            chk("foo of 1 correct", foo(1), value)
            <br />
            chk("foo of 2 correct", foo(2), value)
            <br />

            <br />
            In 99% cases that's the only thing which is needed but unittest
            doesnot
            <br />
            provide it
            <br />

            <br />

            I agree the OOP-only interface is a pain. Many times, I'll have a
            large set of basic tests I'd want to include. Something like
            <br />

            <br />
            <tt>
                <br />
                for i in range(100):
                <br />
                for j in range(100):
                <br />
                self.assertEquals(my_add(i,j), i+j)
                <br />
            </tt>
            <br />

            <br />
            Having all of these in a single test that either fails or succeeds
            as one, is often not what I want.
            <br />

            <br />
            I can hack this, like so:
            <br />

            <br />
            <tt>
                <br />
                class AddTests(unittest.TestCase):
                <br />
                pass
                <br />

                <br />
                for i in range(100):
                <br />
                for j in range(100):
                <br />
                def t(self):
                <br />
                self.assertEqual(myadd(i,j), i+j)
                <br />
                setattr(AddTests, 'test_%s_%s' % (i, j), t)
                <br />
            </tt>
            <br />

            <br />
            but <b>boy</b> does that feel like a hack!
            <br />

            Nope. Sorry - I hope it made sense. Is there any way of putting
            properly indented code in a comment here?

            Doubt it.

            I've put up an

            on my alternate site. The technique is pretty useful. David Goodger
            put something similar in the docutils tests...

            Hi Ian,
            <br />

            <br />
            Thanks for the rant! I'm always keen to hear what people like and
            dislike about unittest.
            <br />

            <br />
            I'm not inclined to defend the spelling habits of Beck or Gamma,
            from whom the spelling of the method names was appropriated, but I
            can at least point out that Merriam Webster lists '<a
                href="http://www.m-w.com/cgi-bin/dictionary?book=Dictionary&va=tear+down"
                target="_blank"
                >tear down</a
            >' and '<a
                href="http://www.m-w.com/cgi-bin/dictionary?book=Dictionary&va=set+up"
                target="_blank"
                >set up</a
            >' as perfectly valid alongside their single word counterparts. Were
            I to write the module again, I would choose a more pythonic naming
            convention for the method names, but it's sadly rather late for that
            now.
            <br />

            <br />
            The inconvenience of testing large data sets with PyUnit is often
            cited, and I am sympathetic to this. This style of testing diverges
            from that of true unit testing, and is not conveniently supported by
            JUnit either. True test-driven development typically specifies
            behaviour incrementally in a relatively small number of pertinently
            named and short unit test methods; unittest supports this well, I
            believe.
            <br />

            <br />
            Of course there is also a place for larger-scale testing with
            extended sets of data. It seems reasonable to expect that unittest
            <i>could</i> be turned to this purpose, and I am investigating what
            can be done to make life easier in this regard. It could also be
            argued that a different kind of testing framework might work better
            for such tests or, perhaps, for your stripped-down individual needs.
            <br />

            <br />
            Whatever the case, if you have concrete suggestions or further
            comments I'd be very happy indeed to hear from you and to do what I
            can to make your life easier.
