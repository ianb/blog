                The metaphors that we use to talk about programming are
                important; often the search for a programming technique is more
                about finding the metaphor than the mechanics -- the mechanics
                probably already existed, there's a good chance the mechanics
                are right under your nose, that you wrote them, but without a
                good metaphor to support it, it's hard to recognize what you
                have.
            </p>
            <p>
                As an example, I saw Alan Kay give a speech some years ago, and
                he identified what he thought was the first object oriented
                system. Written by an unknown soldier (probably not an officer),
                it was a tape system where the tapes contained programs for
                retrieving the records on the tape, and those programs were at
                well-known conditions. I.e., the tape was the object, and those
                programs were the methods. This was maybe sometime in the early
                sixties. This wasn't the <em>birth</em> of object oriented
                programming, merely an example of it; the world wasn't ready for
                its birth, and the unnamed soldier wasn't the voice that could
                introduce it.
            </p>

                So it is, we seldom recognize the important of our new ideas,
                and the ideas that are important are never new. Maybe all the
                best ideas are just ways of telling ourselves what we've
                unwittingly done right, so do more of the same.
