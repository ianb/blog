                that preceded it, have always left me indecisive and unsure.
                They address a problem that is fairly small -- defining forms,
                validation schemas, etc. But since that's a very large part of
                many applications, lots of people are working and thinking about
                these things. But FormEncode is just one project among many, and
                very much on the periphery of other developments, including the
                periphery of my own focus. I don't know what I <em>want</em> it
                to be, except that it isn't there yet, and I'm not driven to
                resolve that or to move forward despite that.
            </p>
            <p>
                I tried splitting FormEncode off into a separate
                <a
                    class="reference"
                    href="http://svn.colorstudy.com/trunk/Validator"
                    >Validation</a
                >
                package, which would contain just the parts I felt most
                comfortable about, and I have used this in some recent websites.
                But I'm still a little iffy about it -- it's simpler than manual
                form handling, but not so much simpler that it's worth it for
                <em>just one project</em>. It introduces new metaphors and
                concepts; for <em>ten</em> projects it would be
                <em>simpler</em>, because it can express certain concepts of
                validation more clearly than ad hoc validation code. But will it
                live (as it is) to ten projects?
            </p>
            <p>
                A coworker noticed that
                <a
                    class="reference"
                    href="http://plone.org/documentation/archetypes"
                    >Archetypes</a
                >
                had split off a validation package. I'd looked at Archetypes
                before, but it was always so caught up in Plone and Zope that I
                didn't really know what to do with it -- it seemed like too much
                of an investment to try to figure out what the interesting parts
                were, and what parts were the Zopey parts that I should avoid,
                since they just give me a headache.
            </p>
            <p>
                So, I start to think: do I need to cut the project loose? Maybe
                I should explore what I could do with Archetypes, maybe help
                split off larger portions of the projects. Or, if not
                Archetypes, then one of the other libraries --
                <a class="reference" href="http://www.gnuenterprise.org/"
                    >GNU Enterprise</a
                >,
                <a class="reference" href="http://peak.telecommunity.com/"
                    >PEAK</a
                >,
                <a
                    class="reference"
                    href="http://dev.zope.org/Wikis/DevSite/Projects/ComponentArchitecture/Zope3SchemasIntroduction"
                    >Zope 3 Schemas</a
                >, or one of the other projects?
            </p>
            <p>
                Actually looking at the validation in the Archetypes package, I
                can't help but think that FormEncode is much better. FormEncode
                has a few ideas that don't seem to be common in these packages:
            </p>
            <ul class="simple">
                <li>
                    Validation and conversion are done together. E.g., a
                    validator for &quot;sometime in the future&quot; can first
                    convert the string to a date, then compare that date to now.
                    Conversely, you can't convert without validation; is
                    <tt class="docutils literal"
                        ><span class="pre">&quot;2008-02-29&quot;</span></tt
                    >
                    a valid date? I'm certainly not going to encode leap year
                    logic into my validator.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Validation can be composed. Mostly it's just two
                    compositions:
                    <tt class="docutils literal"
                        ><span class="pre">Any</span></tt
                    >
                    and
                    <tt class="docutils literal"
                        ><span class="pre">All</span></tt
                    >
                    (<tt class="docutils literal"
                        ><span class="pre">or</span></tt
                    >
                    and
                    <tt class="docutils literal"
                        ><span class="pre">and</span></tt
                    >). You'd actually do the date validation like
                    <tt class="docutils literal"
                        ><span class="pre">All(DateConverter(),</span>
                        <span class="pre"
                            >DateValidator(after=datetime.now()))</span
                        ></tt
                    >
                </li>
                <li>
                    Conversion goes both ways -- external values (e.g., HTML
                    forms) are converted to their Python representation, so
                    Python representations have to be converted back. If you
                    parse dates looking for
                    <tt class="docutils literal"
                        ><span class="pre">YYYY-MM-DD</span></tt
                    >, you better be sure you write dates like
                    <tt class="docutils literal"
                        ><span class="pre">.strftime('%Y-%M-%d')</span></tt
                    >. This was something missing in FunFormKit. I.e., you can
                    only understand how to represent a value in a form
                    <em>contextually</em>, there's no universal way to display a
                    date, or a boolean, or list of strings.
                    <tt class="docutils literal"
                        ><span class="pre">__repr__</span></tt
                    >
                    or
                    <tt class="docutils literal"
                        ><span class="pre">__str__</span></tt
                    >
                    is a really bad way to do this; those are just too
                    overloaded.
                </li>
                <li>
                    It validates plain objects, like dictionaries and lists, so
                    you can validate anything, and no particular interface is
                    preferred.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Everything goes through the same validation process,
                    including entire forms. A form is just a dictionary that
                    needs validation. This makes form composition and repetition
                    a lot easier.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                So it would feel like a big step back if I started working with
                a project that lacked some of these design features. And maybe
                it's not very helpful to join a project coming in with a big
                agenda for change. But I'm not really getting anywhere as it is,
                so I feel like I need to do <em>something</em> with the code and
                ideas; I'm willing to concede and compromise, but I'm not sure
                where to even go with that. And maybe it's just stupid to give
                up on a lot of code, design, and documentation.

                    At this point, I only care about web form validation, and I
                    want that to be done on the client side with JavaScript and
                    at the same time on the backend with Python once the form is
                    submitted.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I imagine there are many ways of doing this. Something that
                    took a config file defining the form inputs with various
                    conditions they must meet and could turn that into the
                    required JavaScript and Python would be nice. I'm such a
                    simpleton when it comes to this stuff though, so I've no
                    idea if this has been done to death already, and I don't
                    have any experience using any of Python's various web
                    framework thingies. I plan to do my own pyweboff soon so I
                    can learn them.

                    Looking at the Validation documentation seems to make my
                    eyes glaze over. I think I need to get more sleep or
                    something.

                        FormEncode doesn't do the Javascript thing, though it's
                        always been something I've meant to add. I've gotten a
                        bit more experience with Javascript since then, so it
                        might be clearer to me how to do it. It's another reason
                        that validation requirements shouldn't be simple
                        functions, but objects with state, with someplace to put
                        the necessary Javascript-generating methods.

                    <p>
                        I think that at the moment the library is portrayed in
                        the documentation (and implemented) in a general way
                        that still requires a fair amount of bridging to use
                        usefully in an application. The pieces are there, but I
                        think it's still a framework issue to make them usable.

                <p>
                    I used FormEncode for a now-on-hold project and I really
                    liked it for the most part. Being able to nest schemas was
                    key for me. There were a few things that could have been
                    easier though. Note that my usage was pretty strange though.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Error reporting wasn't flexible enough for me. IIRC I ended
                    up subclassing schema and only changing a few lines (and it
                    made me feel sick :). I wanted to catch validation errors at
                    the top and decide what to do with them there.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I also wanted to add a bunch of state information to the
                    validation errors. Errors needed to be persistent and I
                    wanted a way of refering back to the validators that failed.
                    (The whole point of the app was to run validations on
                    existing data and to annotate errors, we didn't want to
                    catch them up front.)
                </p>
                <p>
                    I think I ended up passing a state object around to the
                    different validators to accomplish all this, but I was never
                    happy with it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Anyhow, if any of that interests you I'd be glad to talk
                    about it more.

                        I also have used Formencode off and on for a couple
                        things but haven't yet taken the big task to use a
                        different form validation and scheme-building package
                        for our bread-and-butter product, a dynamic
                        survey-building tool.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We may eventually roll our own, but we're currently
                        using FormKit to do it all and have had to build many
                        work-arounds to fit our needs.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I, too, would like to talk to you further about the
                        direction of formencode and how we could participate in
                        its development and testing.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I will be at this year's Pycon so maybe a
                        birds-of-a-feather meeting would be great, or even a
                        sprint on the code would be good. What do you think?

                    I was trying to figure out how to invoke a FormValidator (a
                    comment in the code says it should be chained with Schema).
                    The one that checks all the dependencies in the form and
                    validate the whole request dictionary. We are using ZPT
                    templates for the presentation
                </p>
                <p>Thanks</p>
