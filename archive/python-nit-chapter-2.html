                Well, since my
                <a
                    class="reference"
                    href="http://blog.colorstudy.com/ianb/weblog/2003/10/24.html#P20"

                complaint was over two months ago, I guess I'm fairly happy. Now
                I'll give something of an
                <a
                    class="reference"
                    href="http://blog.colorstudy.com/ianb/weblog/2004/01/11.html#P51"
                    >anti-poka-yoke</a
                >
            </p>
            <p>Who among us has not started with a function like:</p>
            <pre class="literal-block">
def munger(v):
    v = mungify(v)
    return doublemungify(v)
</pre
            >
            <p>
                Then realized
                <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">doublemungify</span></tt>
                goes too far, and changes it to:
            </p>
            <pre class="literal-block">
def munger(v):
    v = mungify(v)
</pre
            >
            <p>
                But, whoops, now the function returns None. There are many ways
                to encounter this common bug, to unintentionally return None by
                not returning anything at all. Maybe one of the execution paths
                doesn't have a return, or you just forgot about the return at
                some point. It happens to me often -- but the worst part is that
                it's not quickly detected. Often I'll collect the results of
                <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">munger</span></tt
                >, and the None will only cause a problem sometime later when
                it's unclear where it came from. Python nit: functions return
                None when you don't want them to return anything -- None is a
                oft-used <em>real</em> value, not some
                this-function-returns-nothing value.
            </p>
            <p>
                It would be better if functions didn't return any value when no
                return (or a bare return) when encountered. So using the second
                <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">munger</span></tt> form in
                an expression would cause an immediate (and informative)
                exception. In other words, distinguishing functions from
                procedures.
            </p>
            <p>
                It <em>seems</em> like there's some sort of elegance in not
                making that distinction, in keeping these objects uniform. Plus
                Pascal distinguishes the two forms, and we all hate Pascal. But
                really, what use can there be to the implicit returning of None?
            </p>
            <p>
                Well, one use, usually in subclassing. Supposing
                <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">munger</span></tt> is a
                method, we might do:
            </p>
            <pre class="literal-block">
class SafeGrinder(Grinder):
    def munger(self, v):
        if not self.isSafe(v):
            raise ValueError, &quot;Unsafe: %s&quot; % v
        return Grinder.munger(self, v)
</pre
            >
            <p>
                Because we can always treat functions as, well, functions, we
                can blindly pass values through. Without this we'd need some
                sort of special syntax to deal with no return value, or else a
                way to test whether the object was a function or procedure. The
                test would be annoying, and would require some static
                declaration (e.g., two kinds of
                <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">def</span></tt
                >). The static declaration would make that pass-through function
                even harder, because it wouldn't be sufficient to just
                <em>test</em> whether the function returned a value, we'd also
                have to declare whether our pass-through code was a function or
                procedure.
            </p>
            <p>
                Some other syntax might be better, like
                <tt class="literal"
                    ><span class="pre">(Grinder.munger(self,</span>
                    <span class="pre">v)</span>
                    <span class="pre">ifprocedure</span>
                    <span class="pre">None)</span></tt
                >, which would evaluate to None if
                <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">Grinder.munger</span></tt>
                was a procedure, or the return value if not. Then you might do
                something like:
            </p>
            <pre class="literal-block">
class OneOff: pass
class SafeGrinder(Grinder):
    def munger(self, v):
        if not self.isSafe(v): raise ValueError, &quot;Unsafe: %s&quot; % v
        result = Grinder.munger(self, v) ifprocedure OneOff
        if result is not OneOff: return result
</pre
            >
            <p>Or maybe even better:</p>
            <pre class="literal-block">
class SafeGrinder(Grinder):
    def munger(self, v):
        if not self.isSafe(v): raise ValueError, &quot;Unsafe: %s&quot; % v
        try:
            return Grinder.munger(self, v)
        except NoReturnValue:
            pass # and return no value
</pre
            >
            <p>
                It can be a little complicated, though only for this one case,
                while other more common cases would be less error-prone. But
                it's not really going to happen in this late stage. Oh well.

            Here it comes...wait for it...wait for it...unit tests would help

            <br />
            If the function which previously returned something meaningful but
            now returns None were being unit tested, the test would immediately
            fail. Then you'd only be out about 30 seconds of your life (time
            between test failing and realizing your mistake). Its a good start
            at the least.
            <br />

            <br />
            But if we're going to take the syntactic route, perhaps requiring a
            return statement would be better. Again, hard to do this late in the
            game. Yep, once you ship a language you're screwed :)

            It strikes me that tests like this are possibly better added to a
            tool like pychecker, rather than to the language itself.
