        <div class="document">
            <p>
                There was a discussion about
                <a class="reference" href="2005-01-htmlfill.html">htmlfill</a>
                and
                <a class="reference" href="http://formencode.org">FormEncode</a>
                on the
                <a class="reference" href="http://subway.python-hosting.com/"
                    >Subway</a
                >
                list
                <a
                    class="reference"
                    href="http://groups-beta.google.com/group/subway-devel/browse_frm/thread/95f5d13eef4387b1/16c353b46f2f09e3#16c353b46f2f09e3"
                    >a while ago</a
                >. One of the things that occurred to me during the discussion
                is that htmlfill would be a lot simpler and more reliable if it
                didn't use
                <a
                    class="reference"
                    href="http://python.org/doc/current/lib/module-HTMLParser.html"
                    >HTMLParser</a
                >, and just worked with a nice DOM-ish tree.
            </p>
            <p>
                And then I thought, well, if you are going to generate a form
                and then pass it to htmlfill (one of a couple options), wouldn't
                it be nice if you passed in the already-parsed tree, instead of
                reparsing? Saves a few cycles at least.
            </p>
            <p>
                In FormEncode I made a little module
                <a
                    class="reference"
                    href="http://svn.colorstudy.com/trunk/FormEncode/src/simplehtmlgen.py"
                    >simplehtmlgen</a
                >
                to generate the HTML -- it's kind of like
                <a
                    class="reference"
                    href="http://starship.python.net/crew/friedrich/HTMLgen/html/main.html"
                    >HTMLGen</a
                >, but a little more isomorphic to HTML/XML. More like
                <a
                    class="reference"
                    href="http://www.divmod.org/Home/Projects/Nevow/#stan"
                    >stan</a
                >, really. Well, I could use stan (which also produces a
                DOM-like object), but I decided to try
                <a
                    class="reference"
                    href="http://effbot.org/zone/element-index.htm"
                    >ElementTree</a
                >
                instead, since I feel vaguely like it's growing standard for
                Pythonic XML. It's not perfect for my purposes -- it might be
                too XML, where I would prefer a more lax perspective that would
                better accommodate HTML.
            </p>
            <p>
                Anyway, I wrote a module for ElementTree,
                <a
                    class="reference"
                    href="http://svn.colorstudy.com/trunk/Validator/validator/htmlgen.py"
                    >htmlgen</a
                >. You use it like:
            </p>
            <pre class="literal-block">
html.textarea(name='entry', class_='big_field')(text_content)
</pre
            >
            <p>
                And you get back subclasses of ElementTree's Elements (which you
                can continue to call to add more attributes or content to). The
                subclass also adds a
                <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">__str__</span></tt> method
                which serializes the XML (using a default encoding -- I'm not
                100% comfortable with a default encoding, but it
                <em>seems</em> like a good idea to my naive unicode mind).
                Anyway, about ElementTree...
            </p>
            <p>
                One of the odd parts of ElementTree is how it deals with text.
                Tags have a
                <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">text</span></tt>
                attribute, which is the text immediately contained in the tag,
                and a
                <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">tail</span></tt> attribute
                which contains the text immediately after the tag ends. There's
                no text node or text structure that is a child of another tag.
                There's also no object to represent a set of nodes (except a
                normal list) so I had to be careful to flatten lists (since I do
                want to handle sets of tags that aren't a valid XML tree).
                Anyway, I think this library simplifies some of that, things
                you'd mostly notice if you are building trees with ElementTree
                instead of parsing XML documents.
            </p>
            <p>
                Another odd thing is that there's no way to serialize nodes to
                unicode -- to do that I had to serialize them to bytes and then
                decode to unicode. Seemed like a weird omission. And you can't
                put in any kind of unparsed literal into the tree, you can only
                put real nodes in, so there's no way to make a
                <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">literal</span></tt>
                class/function/builder. This makes sense from a parsing point of
                view (since you couldn't reparse the serialized output if it
                wasn't valid), but is a common feature of HTML builders. Instead
                I guess you just have to parse XML strings before inserting
                them, which is easy enough.
            </p>
            <p>
                One positive point (which from another perspective might be a
                negative) ElementTree doesn't seem very namespace-aware, so I
                can create tags and attributes with
                <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">:</span></tt> in them
                (which means I can generate
                <a
                    class="reference"
                    href="http://www.zope.org/DevHome/Wikis/DevSite/Projects/ZPT/FrontPage"
                    >ZPT</a
                >).
            </p>
            <p>
                I feel a little badly about subclassing
                <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">Element</span></tt>
                (technically
                <tt class="literal"
                    ><span class="pre">_ElementInterface</span></tt
                >), because it means there's a more-featureful class of nodes
                that can easily be mixed in with a less-featureful class (or
                vice versa). The builder syntax isn't a big deal -- there's no
                real reason to use that in lieu of the normal methods when
                manipulating a tree that is already created. But things like
                <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">__str__</span></tt> are
                likely to be useful, but at the same time limiting if you depend
                on them.

                    &quot;htmlfill would be a lot simpler and more reliable if
                    it didn't use HTMLParser&quot;

                <p>
                    Guess it's probably obvious to those that have already
                    realised it but only recently occurred to me that parsing
                    HTML could be alot easier (particularily when it comes to
                    perserving things like whitespace) with a specific parser
                    that gets only what you need while regarding the rest of the
                    document as &quot;just text&quot;, vs. a generic HTML parser
                    which is aware of the complete vocabulary.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In PHP there's an excellent lexing tool in SimpleTest which
                    uses &quot;parallel regular expressions&quot; -
                    <a
                        class="reference"
                        href="http://cvs.sourceforge.net/viewcvs.py/simpletest/simpletest/parser.php?view=markup"

                    >
                    which would suit the job. Don't know what's available for
                    lexing in Python so well but seems like SimpleParse might do
                    the job.

                    That's kind of what htmlfill does -- it lets HTMLParser
                    parse the tags, but it just echos out all the parts

                            Was referring to the process of lexing the raw text
                            in the first place. Rather than using characters
                            like &gt; and &lt; to find tokens, as is common in
                            most HTML parsers (HTMLParser and sgmllib seem to do
                            this), look for specific tags by name while treating
                            all else as unintesting plain text, although it may
                            contain HTML tags we're no interested in. In this
                            case it might amount to some fairly simple regular
                            expressions.

                I thought the 'text' attribute thing with ElementTree was a
                little odd at first as well. However, beyound this, I think
                ElementTree is Pythonic and quite handy. I have written dozens
                of parsers and generators with ElementTree and can no complain.
                Also, I do use

                which reminds me a bit of what your doing here.
