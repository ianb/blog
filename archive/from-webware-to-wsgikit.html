        <h1>From Webware to WSGIKit</h1>

        <div class="document">
            <p>
                A while ago there was a thread on the webware-discuss mailing
                list that helped me think about what
                <a
                    class="reference"
                    href="http://svn.colorstudy.com/trunk/WSGIKit/"
                    >WSGIKit's</a
                >
                role is in relation to
                <a class="reference" href="http://webwareforpython.org"
                    >Webware</a
                >, and what my own goals are.
            </p>
            <p>
                First, is WSGIKit purely a reimplementation of Webware, or is it
                an improvement on Webware? Really part of what I want from WSGI
                is the possibility to move beyond the Webware interface and API
                without splitting environments; which is why I want to have
                something that is backward compatible with Webware while leaving
                the possibility for using novel new techniques alongside it. I
                can imagine all sorts of better interfaces, but I don't want to
                break Webware trying to get there. Several years ago that might
                have made sense for Webware, but it doesn't make sense now,
                that's just not the place Webware is strategically.
            </p>
            <p>
                And while I want to support Webware applications indefinitely,
                it might not be that long before I'm programming with something
                else. Achieving that incrementally is part of what I want to do
                with WSGIKit -- so that Webware <em>melts</em> away more than me
                just choosing (or making) Yet Another Framework. WSGIKit
                supports a thin Webware interface over a bunch of neutral
                components, which means choosing Webware at that point would be
                more of an aesthetic choice than a platform choice. Which a good
                choice to ask users to make. The way things are now, it's more
                about weighing the shortcomings rather than looking for the
                advantages.
            </p>
            <p>
                Webware has particular attributes, like the AppServer, the
                exception handler, etc. These I think of as features, but not
                its essence. Another framework could reach parity with Webware
                fairly easy in those terms, but if it matches the Webware
                interface then it &quot;is&quot; Webware. In that way WSGIKit
                can be Webware.
            </p>
            <p>
                You can build a better interface on top of Webware. It's
                reasonably easy, really -- Webware is lighter than it might
                seem, and you could wrap things in a quite different interface,
                create what would be an entirely new framework. The disapointing
                part is that such a sub-framework will appeal to only a portion
                of the Webware audience, which is a small portion of the Python
                audience. At each point you're splitting your audience into ever
                smaller chunks.
            </p>
            <p>
                And so I realize that the biggest reason I'm interested in WSGI
                and WSGIKit is because I don't want to split my audience, I'm
                tired of that. I accept and am okay that my audience is people
                who are using Python, but if it's just people who use Python and
                have chosen Webware, that's too small a chunk. And I don't like
                the idea that first you choose your framework, then you choose
                the other libraries based on that; that's not a good way to make
                a choice.
