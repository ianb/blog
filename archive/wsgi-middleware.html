        <h1>WSGI Middleware</h1>
        <p>
            I was playing around with making a
            <a
                href="http://mail.python.org/pipermail/web-sig/2004-August/000518.html"
                >WSGI</a
            >
            server, and I'm starting to think that some really neat stuff could
            be done with middleware. (The rest of this post might not make much
            sense if you haven't read that spec.)
        </p>

        <p>
            For instance, I was thinking about setting up something for Medusa
            with WSGI. But though I think asynchronous code seems like a good
            server architecture, I'm not that interested in it for applications.
            But this iteration of the WSGI spec allows for async pretty well;
            you can tell you are in that situation when
            <tt>wsgi.multiprocess</tt> is false and <tt>wsgi.multithread</tt> is
            false, and the iterator output can produce the data fairly well.
        </p>

        <p>
            I then realized that threading itself could be a piece of middleware
            -- you just have to do the proper buffering with input and output,
            and spawn the necessary threads. An intelligent application that
            realizes it can't run as an async process could install this
            middleware itself when necessary.
        </p>

        <p>
            Even multiprocess could really be implemented as a piece of
            middleware, either running CGI scripts, or forking worker processes.
            It could get out of hand if every application in a multi-application
            system had its own middleware; but the extension mechanism could
            also allow you to lazily implement these models, providing callbacks
            to access existing thread or worker process pools.
        </p>

        <p>
            Another useful piece of middleware would be something for error
            reporting; it would basically pass everything through, but wrap
            everything in try:except:. Then you could develop and plug a nice
            debugger into whatever architecture, and the basic server can do
            just the most minimal error logging (basically print a traceback to
            the error log).
        </p>

        <p>
            Despite it's low-level simplicity, I think WSGI could be a very
            capable building block for Python web programming -- something we
            desperately need.
        </p>

            I like your thinking here; I've read the spec, and am excited by it,
            too.

            I was thinking for example, that this would help to make Twisted (or
            Medusa) the HTTPD for Webkit. One side is async, the other side
            threads, and wscgi in the middle.

            What I find fascinating: that's exactly what I implemented with the
            Toolserver Framework for Python -
            <a
                href="http://pyds.muensterland.org/wiki/toolserver.html"
                target="_blank"

            >
            - a Medusa with integrated threading for dynamic tools. You have
            medusa for the static content delivery and can hook into it, if you
            want. Or you build tools (just some Python classes) that are
            dynamically loaded on server start and will be handled by
            dynamically allocated worker threads (much in the same way as Apache
            manages it's processes). So one side async, the other side threads,
            only the middleware is TooFPy :-)
