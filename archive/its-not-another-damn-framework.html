                just wrote a WSGI middleware for interpreting XSLT. This is
                cool, because it's one of those things I've thought is perfect
                for WSGI, and I even
                <a
                    class="reference"
                    href="http://mail.python.org/pipermail/web-sig/2005-July/001517.html"
                    >mentioned it</a
                >
                yesterday. This means any WSGI application can output XML and
                have it transformed by an XSLT stylesheet, without any awareness
                on the part of the application.
            </p>
            <p>
                It's also great to see someone catch on to what WSGI is about.
                I'm afraid I haven't been that successful explaining it. But
                maybe I should use his endorsement of the architecture:
                &quot;it's not another damn framework.&quot;
            </p>
            <p>
                And that's exactly the kind of architectural principle that made
                me write Paste. I've been describing it as a &quot;framework
                framework&quot;, which is awful -- 2x the badness! Really, it's
                a collection of <em>exactly</em> the sort of thing that Leslie
                wrote -- simple, decoupled bits of middleware. Oh, damn, there's
                that &quot;middleware&quot; word again, which is also
                <em>bad</em>. Simple, decoupled <em>filters</em>. Everything
                else in Paste is the crap I had to put in to get it to work
                together. Stuff like configuration. This <em>isn't</em> what
                makes me excited -- it's just the pain in the ass that someone
                needs to do, and at least in the context of WSGI no one else is
                doing it.
            </p>
            <p>
                What makes me excited is bits of code like this. This is 55
                (logical) lines of code that implement XSLT in front of any
                Python application that produces XML (and if someone writes a
                WSGI proxy app, in front of any application in any language). 55
                lines -- <em>that</em> is what excites me.
            </p>

                spec, it can be swallowed up by filtering apps. The filtered
                apps can have any number of mammoth Python web frameworks
                powering them, and the filters can be as complex or simple as
                you want. Hell,
                <em>build a web framework entirely out of composed filters!</em>

                Which is exactly what I did with Paste's Webware interface, and
                later

                -- I moved everything I could into middleware, and built the
                shell of a framework around it. And it works -- the core of

                    ><span class="pre">paste.webkit</span></tt
                >
                is 776 lines of code, and the code it replaces is 6313 lines of
                code. That 700ish lines of code doesn't provide all the
                functionality of the original 6000ish lines of code; but it
                builds a Webwarish thing on top of generic libraries. For both
                of them I don't count the 600 lines in the standard library's
                <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">cgi</span></tt>
                module either, or the 50,000+ lines in the standard library as a
                whole; so I think there is a fair comparison. If you refactored
                a framework like
                <a class="reference" href="http://cherrypy.org">CherryPy</a> to
                use WSGI middleware, I think you'd see the same kind of results.
            </p>
            <p>
                The point of Paste is that you shouldn't have to compromise
                between <em>simple</em> and <em>full-featured</em>, or between
                <em>abstract</em> and <em>convenient</em>, or
                <em>general</em> and <em>concrete</em>. Paste is WSGI. Paste is
                filters built on filters. Paste is HTTP turned into Python
                dictionaries. WSGI is working from where CGI left off. It's the
                simplest thing that can work. It's not a framework.

                <p>Ian, I think finally <em>get it</em>. :-)</p>
                <p>
                    Paste is not a 'framework framework' and it's
                    'middleware'... it's 'filters'! &lt;cue sound of mind going
                    'click!'&gt; My brain only 'gets' things when I can see a
                    practical use for it. :-)
                </p>
                <p>
                    I've been playing around with CherryPy's filters and that
                    description makes sense. You can write a function or class
                    method once, and use filters to repurpose the
                    functions/methods for different contexts (HTTP/HTML vs
                    XML-RPC) without touching your original function/method
                    definitions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Perhaps, you could also call them &quot;wrappers&quot; or
                    &quot;envelopes&quot;. And I'm sure Martin Fowler has a
                    pattern with a really complicated name for it, too. :-) But
                    filters fits my brain the best.
                </p>
                <p>
                    With filters (at least as I understand it in CherryPy), you
                    can do the following:
                </p>
                <ol class="arabic">
                    <li>
                        <p class="first">
                            Write a function called helloWorld() that simply
                            returns the string &quot;Hello, world!&quot;
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p class="first">
                            Now go write a filter that can accept XML-RPC
                            commands and dispatch them to any function, and take
                            any return values and return them as XML-RPC.
                            (CherryPy already provides this for XML-RPC).
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p class="first">
                            Do the same for SOAP, YAML, XML, JSON, GZIP
                            compression, conversion to PDF, or whatever
                        </p>
                    </li>

                                your helloWorld using a filter of your choosing:

                    Voila! Paste now makes sense to me. I can see how this would
                    be useful, too... I don't think Django does Webservices
                    (XML-RPC, SOAP, REST), yet. (I could be wrong, but I haven't
                    seen any mention of it, yet.) If there was a
                    &quot;standard&quot; implementation of &quot;filters&quot;
                    that other frameworks could use... then Django could benefit
                    from this work for free without having to reimplement
                    CherryPy's filters.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now that I've written all of this... Do I understand WSGI
                    and Paste correctly? Now, that I think about it... you also
                    just reinvented unix pipes, but for the web. And I think
                    Apache 2 even implements the same thing, too. (<a

                <p>
                    I've been trying to understand WSGI and Paste for a while
                    now, and have stayed subscribed to your blog despite not
                    understanding what you were talking about. I kept wondering
                    why you didn't just do something like Rails in Python.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The 0xDECAFBAD blog entry definitely made all the difference
                    for me in understanding what you are doing, and why you are
                    doing it. The 'framework' and 'middleware' words definitely
                    have too much baggage to be used to describe something truly
                    new and innovative. Another way of thinking about it is that
                    we are only starting to see the first web frameworks worthy
                    of the name, and perhaps the same can be said of WSGI as an
                    example of 'real' middleware, at least in the brave new
                    world of web 2.0.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I just wonder whether the Ruby/Rails people will be
                    interested, and if so how they will adopt the ideas. I can't
                    help but think about how cool it would be for the Python and
