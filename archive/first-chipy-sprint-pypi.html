</div><h1>First ChiPy Sprint: PyPI</h1>
 
<div class="document">
<p><a class="reference" href="http://chipy.org">ChiPy</a> had its first sprint today.  We worked on <a class="reference" href="http://python.org/pypi">PyPI</a>.  There were
some larger goals, but in the end we didn't get a whole lot done.  I
think this is actually typical for sprints -- they are a chance to get
started on something, and become comfortable with a new project, but
they aren't exceptionally productive.</p>
<p>We started out the day by getting a working environment going.  This
proved to be rather difficult.  Every one of us happened to have a Mac
laptop, but installing SQLite (PyPI's backend database) and pysqlite
turned out to be rather difficult, along with making sure Apache was
up, CGI was being served, and HTTP authentication was getting through
(something Apache makes difficult).  Personally I got stuck on
pysqlite, because apparently my Python installation is all messed up.
The whole thing was just poor judgement on our parts -- we ended up
all working on the chipy.org server, where <a class="reference" href="http://weblog.lonelylion.com/">Chris</a> had a decent working
environment for a web application.  In the future I'd plan on working on a single server
from the start, or else making sure everyone got a working environment
set up before they come.</p>
<p>Another issue (which we kind of expected) is that none of us had
worked on PyPI before, so we weren't familiar with the code or what
was involved.  But the code is actually pretty straight forward --
it's really just a normal database-driven web application,
so it wasn't too hard.</p>
<p>We split up a bit.  I worked on creating <a class="reference" href="http://zpt.sf.net">ZPT</a> templates, and removing
the HTML from the main class/module.  <a class="reference" href="http://brianray.chipy.org/">Brian</a> worked on documenting the
SQLite database, and getting stuff in place to make it easier to
update the schema and add new fields, while retaining information from
the old database.  He's also interested in moving it to PostgreSQL.
Everyone else worked on adding XMLRPC support.  I had thought the
server already supported XMLRPC for the distutil register command, but
apparently that command just submits a normal POST form.  They are
really interested in making a command-line client to PyPI, so XMLRPC
(using <a class="reference" href="http://python.org/doc/current/lib/module-xmlrpclib.html">xmlrpclib</a>) seemed like the right way to do it.  In the end
they mostly spent time learning about XMLRPC and getting exceptions
working sanely and whatnot; they didn't have a chance to actually
implement useful functions.  Luckily that's actually pretty easy with
xmlrpclib, and I think they did a lot of the hard stuff in the sprint
-- it's a good chance to work on things you aren't familiar with.</p>
<p>The people who worked together used <a class="reference" href="http://www.gnu.org/software/screen/">screen</a>, which worked pretty well.
There was an editor conflict; I use Emacs, and a couple other people
use vi, and Brant was trying to decide which one he'd use, so he
wasn't familiar with either.  But besides that screen was a good way
to collaborate, even though I felt a need to develop a set of <a class="reference" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizens%27_band_radio">CB</a>-like
signals to indicate who's driving and when you're done.</p>
<p>We set stuff up in a <a class="reference" href="http://lonelylion.com/chipy/pypi/">Subversion repository</a> to share our work; and I
think we'll all be continuing what we started so the repository will
continue to be useful.  (I still have to make a better, more technical
summary for <a class="reference" href="http://www.python.org/sigs/catalog-sig/">Catalog-SIG</a>)</p>

I have to say that <cite>screen</cite> is one of the most useful applications around.  I've been using daily it since my college days, though I can't say I've ever used it in group share mode.  That's something I'm going to have to try out.  I believe someone wrote a collaborative editor in Python for these types of sessions, but I honestly wouldn't find a reason to use it when screen+${EDITOR} works just as well.  Perhaps using IRC or Jabber could help with your CB messages. ;-)</div>

<p>Well, since we were all in the same room, we actually just had to say &quot;ok, I'm done&quot;, or &quot;let me edit that.&quot;  It's just easy to forget and then have more than one person typing (or everyone staring at the screen waiting for someone to do something).</p>
<p>To do it in multi-user mode we all logged in as the same user, and used <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">screen</span> <span class="pre">-x</span></tt>.  And then hit some magic keys (maybe just ^A-#) -- I haven't used screen much before so I'm fuzzy on the details.</p>

<p>There's an entire suite of access control list commands to use for multi-user sessions.  You can apparently create user-specific ACL's or add entire groups to the session, and it allows fairly finite control over windows and commands available.  It's a pretty advanced piece of software, most of the features of which are never used by the average end-user.  One of my favorite .screenrc lines is the following:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
# Always add the status bar
# ------------------------------------------
# &quot;%-w%n %t%+w %= %H(%l) %Y/%m/%d %0c&quot;
# ------------------------------------------
# %-w      All windows up to the current one
# %n %t    Number and name of current window
# %+w      All windows after the current one
# %=       Pad spaces
# %H       Host name
# %l       System Load
# %m/%d %c Month/Day TIME
# ------------------------------------------
caption always &quot;%{+b}%{.gR}%-w%{.rB}%n %t%{-}%+w %=%{..B} %H(%l) %{..R}%Y/%m/%d %0c&quot;
