                Zope and an RDBMS are a horrible combination. It's awkward and
                annoying for a while, until it becomes unmanageable and horrid.
                Like, did you know if you get a conflict error from your RDBMS,
                Zope will retry the entire transaction (i.e., rerun the
                request)? It would be handy, unless it's not what you want, and
                if it's not what you want nobody knows what to do next. That's
                just one of many gotchas when using an RDBMS with Zope.
            </p>
            <p>
                I would just dive in and change stuff around, but I know I'd
                just recreate another set of problems, because everything is so
                damn subtle (read: tricky and likely to break). Zope learning
                starts out hard, then gets easy after an hour, then gets hard
                again after another hour, then gets impossible after a week. Or
                it stays just hard, but you've unwittingly created buggy,
                unscalable, insecure applications.
            </p>
            <p>
                All my Zope unhappiness might be okay -- not great, but maybe
                okay -- if it was just <em>pleasant</em> once in a while. But
                it's never pleasant, just bearable.
            </p>
            <p>
                Damn, I'd almost rather work in PHP. Actually I would. That's
                how much I dislike Zope. At least you get all their crap up
                front, and you can just work around it.

            Ian, <br />
            <br />
            Very similar experiences to what I had. It was deathly hard to get
            my head around zope, then when i tried to do anything beyond simple
            it got very hard again. I found that when just using plone to have a
            basic intranet portal (read link dump to internal documents) it was
            straight forward. But once I tried to use a RDBMS I kept on feeling
            like I was wrestling with pretty simple stuff to make it zope like.
            The quixote and webware approach seem much more friendly in
            hindsight :)
            <br />

            I agree with Chris M. I've been doing RDBMS with Zope for years, and
            it was very natural to me from day one.
            <br />

            <br />
            In fact, I have yet to find a RDBMS interaction system in Python
            that I would prefer. And believe me, I've looked. (In house
            frameworks should eventually satisfy me).

            Zope's never <i>felt</i> like Python to me. Obviously it is
            Python... maybe I mean "Pythonic", for some internal concept of what
            Pythonic means to me. Maybe it's just that I've only used Zope
            professionally, and that colors my perspective, but it's never been
            emotionally satisfying, which isn't true of programming or Python in
            general.

            I don't think you've explained the actual problem very well. Maybe
            you'd rather not, which I can understand. ;-)

            In part it really is an emotional response, which is hard to
            pinpoint in one place. It's not any one detail -- there's always
            details that are problematic with any system. I could create a long
            list of details, and that would account for some of it, but even
            those cumulative details don't really account for it.
            <br />

            <br />
            I think it's really a feeling that I am not in control. I don't feel
            confident about my applications, and the way they will work in
            production. They depend intimately on a system that I don't
            understand, that I feel I <i>can't</i> understand. Learning about
            Zope doesn't lead me to feel more in control -- often it's exactly
            the opposite, I feel less in control the more I learn, which is
            incredibly discouraging. And in the end, I simply don't buy the It's
            Complicated But It's Powerful argument -- not just for Zope, but in
            an abstract sense I find that argument flawed. Even its "power"
            feels like a flaw to me, so I'm left with very little motivation.

            I'm sympathetic because it's not as if I haven't cursed Zope up and
            down for one reason or another on a daily basis. But it does its job
            more or less most of the time. Then again, I've never asked Zope to
            satisfy me emotionally, so maybe I just have low standards. ;-)

            When I say "emotional" of course I mean the difference between
            enjoying what I'm doing, and simply doing it because I have to. The
            word "emotional" might carry more weight than that, though...

            Zope, asyncore, medusa,...
            <br />
            This is the downside of Python: it allows hard-working people to
            produce something working. The result is of course far from elegant,
            difficult to grasp, difficult to use, ...
            <br />
            I would recommend Python only to talented people. Otherwise, Python
            acts as a bullshit magnifier ...
            <br />
            My 2 cents

            Although it's often a problem with Web applications, Zope never
            really seemed to lend itself to incremental development and testing.
            I know that they've improved things recently, and the emphasis on
            components is very welcome, but there's nothing worse than having to
            stop and start servers, redeploy stuff, and so on (especially if the
            software runs like treacle).
            <br />

            <br />
            I've come round to thinking that architectures should be as shallow
            as possible because they then lend themselves to being
            comprehensively tested and understood. Zope and various J2EE
            frameworks seem to be like towers in contrast to such ideals.

            For some projects I'm working on, the lack of explicit control over
            transactions is a deal breaker. (There may very well be a way to get
            explicit transaction control, but I sure can't find it.) Not to
            mention the fact that in several respects the bog-standard python
            DB-API is superior to what you have to wrastle with inside ZSQL
            templates. Chris's "it's just python, guys" comment is misleading,
            while true; python is both a way of doing things and a specific
            implementation. Zope strips from you almost everything you'd expect
            to be doing if you had experience working with relational DBs with
            python outside of zope.

            I think Ethan hit on what I was trying to say. ZSQL templates just
            seemed unnatural to me. Also, once I had everything worked out in
            ZSQL scripts it wasn't usable outside of Zope so it seemed limiting.
            <br />
            <br />
            I found working with the DB-API much more straightforward.

            I've worked with Perl, PHP, and Python (in that order). I've settled
            into Python, I like it very much. It's "satisfying".
            <br />

            <br />
            I tried Python CGI, and ended up getting really frustrated. I tried
            Zope, and have had mostly good experiences. I have a few
            applications working, and am introducing my co-workers to it now,
            because I think it's relatively easy to use. The web interface is
            comforting if you haven't done a lot of web development. I like the
            fact that I don't have to rewrite common code, like user
            authentication, it's just built in.
            <br />

            <br />
            Now though, I'm really not sure what direction to go in. I'd like to
            be able to commit to a direction for a while. The first step was
            focusing on a language, I chose Python, now I need to focus on a web
            framework. It's a really muddy field, and it's very frustrating.

            Ethan: yes, the DB-API is a good example. In fact, the DB-API is
            pretty lame to work with -- it's long-winded and not that pleasant
            to use. <i>But</i>, all its problems are up-front and obvious, and
            it lends itself well to serving as a base for a more pleasant
            system. Z-SQL methods are, of course, quite the opposite. Besides
            being one language (Z SQL) piled ontop of another language (DTML),
            neither of which are good languages (and they <i>definitely</i> are
            not Python!), they also resist safely abstracting the SQL generation
            process, and they resist sensible composition.

            My thoughts are that Zope is terribly unsatisfying when you try and
            coerce DTML or ZPT do too much of the work that SHOULD be done by an
            external python script. Go here

            It really is a multi-leveled app server. It makes somewhat hard
            things easy, and then they get awkward as you want them to do more,
            and then, do they get easier again? Hopefully one day I will find

            <br />
            I've been _loving_ using ZPT and python scripts to display and edit
            databases using ZSQL. After researching lots of different ways of
            doing it, (Tapestry, jsp, webware, php, jhtml, etc...) I've found my
            favorite way is using zope.
            <br />

            <br />
            I've put together about five different sites that work with
            databases, and the first one took me about five days of part time,
            and subsequent ones haven't taken more than about two hours each.
            (Each one deals with 3 SQL tables max.)
            <br />

            <br />
            I have forms that act as both an add and an edit, and I've never had
            any databese requests fail. The ZSQL Connection has lots of
            parameters that let me control everything that I'd want to, and it
            does some nice database pooling so I don't have to.
            <br />

            <br />
            I think my advice to anyone else would be to avoid all the shiny
            things in zope that are supposed to make things easier, and keep it
            to Page Templates, Python Scripts, and ZSQL methods.

            Well, as for speed of implementation, zope can be a RAD tool for web
            development. It's just that it seems to lock everything up inside
            the mysterious ZODB. <br />

            Ian, saying that you'd prefer php, cmon we all know you'd be using

            My "it's just Python" comment was meant to mean you can use the
            DB-API if you want... just write the code to do it and plug it in an
            external method or product on the filesystem. Those developing in
            Zope through the web will always be terribly disappointed at some
            point, sorry, nothing can be done about that.

            I sort of call bullshit. If you want a raw rdbms connection
            <br />
            object in Zope. If you have a DA Adapter in ZODB you can grab a hold
            of the raw db-api connection object. As far as catching
            ConflictError - I believe you can catch this.
            <br />

            <br />
            from ZODB.POSException import ConflictError
            <br />

            <br />
            try:
            <br />
            your_code()
            <br />
            except ConflictError:
            <br />
            log('eek, conflicterror')
            <br />

            <br />
            maybe this works?

            Chris, Alan: I generally worry that I'm going to get burned when I
            try to treat Zope as "just Python". This is mostly due to Zope's
            security, which at once stymies me and scares me -- I know there's
            big holes in my applications, but none of the holes that I
            <i>want</i>. Anyway, passing objects into and out of Zope is less
            than trivial -- I only feel confident when I'm passing builtin
            structures (strings, lists, dicts, etc).
            <br />

            <br />
            But yes, I could figure this out and use the DB-API and ignore Zope
            entirely. That's frustrating, because that's not how I've developed
            the application so far. And I've been following the documentation's
            suggestions -- the problem is that most Zope documentation suggests
            a style of programming that is not appropriate for complex
            applications. And now that the applications exist in their current
            form, moving into the plain Python environment is not that easy. And
            if I do, why do I want to use Zope at all?
            <br />

            <br />
            Okay, okay, there's ways to deal with it all, and there's ways ways
            to use Zope better, and there are things that Zope provides -- but
            none of that addresses the real driving factor behind the post: Zope
            makes me unhappy. You can't argue with that! My programmer-happiness
            expectations are high -- as well they should be! This is Python
            after all, we should expect more. I don't like the feeling that I
            don't understand the system, that I can't easily understand the
            system; that's there's always a technique I'm missing; that there's
            always a system interaction bug I'm not expecting; I don't like that
            I feel ignorant, and yet I feel like I know more than many Zope
            programmers -- I can deal with ignorance, but there's something
            wrong when there's so many people starving for too little knowledge.
            And I hate, hate, hate the idea that Zope Is Complex But Powerful.
            The whole idea of Complex But Powerful feels fucked up to me; a
            great way for consultants to sell their services. I'm just trying to
            build stupid websites, not rocket science, these aren't advancing
            the state of the art... shouldn't that be easy? I'd like to get to
            the rocket science part, but if I can't build the stupid website
            easily I'm not going to buy into the rocket science.
            <br />

            <br />
            Now I'm just getting ranty. But it's frustrating.

            Ian, if you're interested in using something more pythonic, you
            might want to try twisted (www.twistedmatrix.com). I started using
            Zope in 1.x days and have since left it for the same reasons you've
            highlighted here. I've found twisted difficult to get started but
            once you get your head around some of the basic concepts, it's
            actually pretty fun to work with.
            <br />

            <br />
            You could use the 'high level' web application development package
            Nevow (<a href="http://nevow.com/)" target="_blank"
                >http://nevow.com/)</a
            >
            which is the next generation woven. Nevow is usable but still not
            1.0, so perhaps you might want to use twisted.web.server and
            twisted.web.resource directly. It even supports ssl/tls. You could
            plugin processors for other types of 'documents' (twisted supports
            php and quixote templates, for example).
            <br />

            <br />
            One negative point is that being new, twisted docs are...well, have
            plenty of room to improve.

            I wrote a long response to this here about TTW development vs.
            filesystem-based development but just erased it. It feels pointless,
            as this topic has been discussed ad-nauseam on Zope lists and
            elsewhere.
            <br />

            <br />
            Maybe you should consider recusing yourself from doing Zope
            development for a while? I'm not trying to be snarky at all by
            saying that, it's a serious suggestion. There are plenty of other
            Python frameworks for building web apps out there (but you know
            that...) Zope really just isn't for everyone, and it's *ok* that you
            prefer using something else. I'd miss the outlook of your posts
            about Zope, actually, but they seem to be at the expense of your
            "programming happiness" which no one should deny you of! ;-)

            Chris: the Zope development I do is purely as an employee, so I
            don't entirely get to choose to recuse myself. But I am actually
            pushing pretty hard at work for us to try new things. Like Webware
            (obviously, considering my background with that project). I've held
            back from making those suggestions before now, because I haven't
            felt as confident about my own assessment of Zope, or my assessments
            of the company's needs. Given a little more time with both of those,
            I'm being more active in pushing specific technologies and
            strategies.
            <br />

            <br />
            It's funny though... am I pushing these changes because they are the
            right choice, or just the right choice for me? Of course, with only
            three and a half developers, even if it's <i>only</i> the right
            choice for me, that doesn't mean it's not the right choice for the
            company. It's hard to be objective, but at the same time I'm not a
            disinterested consultant. But I'm proud of that, you can't be
            disinterested and constructive at the same time. And sometimes I
            feel partisan, but maybe I'm just opinionated and invested.
            <br />

            <br />
            (BTW, Chris, I found the document you wrote about

            in Zope to be quite helpful in thinking about our processes -- if I
            felt committed to Zope development, that would be the direction I'd
            be pushing; at the same time, it seems like nearly as radical a
            change to our development process as using Webware)

            Ian can't agree with you more!! Bascially my feeling is that writing
            Python should be fun and almost always is!! Python is usually a
            refreshing break from writing Java, everyday. But Zope isn't a
            refreshing break from J2EE if you will. Specifically Servlets part
            of the spec. Sure love plone and the content managment management
            stuff is great! If Zope was to J2EE as Python is to Java. From what
            little I have read about Zope 3 it is supposed to be better (which
            is quite a loose term). Here's hopping.

            The "Zope is Python's J2EE" view is quite compelling, especially if
            you look at some of the Zope 3 documentation. However, after reading
            the recent comments of James Gosling (and having done a fair amount
            of J2EE development), J2EE doesn't really seem to be a great role
            model, at least where simple and understandable Web development is
            concerned.

            I don't get the impression that J2EE is a model for Zope 3 at all,
            at least on any technical level. In terms of strategy and target
            domain, sure, but that's probably not where J2EE's flaws come from.

            I think Erik's comment about using external scripts is right on
            target. I have had more than my share of frustration with Zope as
            well, Ian. And I really do get your emotional reaction. I find
            coding python one of the most enjoyable things I can do with a
            computer and Zope has often been very frustrating in contrast. And,
            like you, my major use of zope has been for a work project.
            <br />

            <br />
            But lately I have traced my dislike of zope to two main factors.
            Really, really muddled documentation (which has gotten somewhat
            better since 2.6) and the fact that I was using the wrong parts
            (muddled documentation, anyone?) of it in the wrong way. Switching
            from DTML to ZPT, understanding and extensively using external
            scripts and developing as products instead of internally has gone a
            long way toward easing my pain. I won't say that I find developing
            in zope a dream, but honestly I find developing with any extensive
            framework always to have a good share of annoyances and gotchas as I
            have to wrap my head around someone else's idea of the best way to
            do something. That might just be me being a little slow to pick
            things up unless I coded them, tho.

            I faced the same problem with one of my last Zope projects (a Zope
            product with tons of ZSQL statements in a seperate .py file which
            were rather awkward to integrate with an OO program structure).
            <br />

            <br />
            For the successor of this project i used SQLObject :) Worked well (i
            hooked up the transactions to the Zope transactions), but i wasn't
            able to directly publish SQLObjects on the web (with bobo_traverse)
            & therefore had to use wrapper code.
            <br />

            <br />
            For my next project I will try out Twisted + Nevow, although I am
            not sure if async programming is a good idea...

            might be an alternative for you. Just plug in a good template engine
            and for example SQLObject for persistency. But be warned that TooFPy
            is more targeted towards web services than web applications with
            browser based GUIs, so it's rather low-level.

            Not directly, but I wrote a small wrapper around SQLObject (Hi Ian!
            :) that solves a great part of this problem, if not all. It
            integrates very nicely with the transaction machinery of ZODB,
            because the transaction api in Zope 3 is much better defined.
            Unfortunately, Zope 3 may not be an option for everyone :)

                I've resorted to building my own application framework in PHP
                that persists objects in individual files vs. a &quot;black
                box&quot; database and implements limited Zope-like acquisition
                of methods and properties. It's not a complete Zope knock-off by
                any stretch, but it will do 90% of what I'd use Zope for, sans
                the hair-pulling.

                    <p>
                        I started to look into zope as I was looking for a
                        decent templating system for CherryPy. I stumbled on
                        SimpleTAL (ZPT without Zope) which seems to work
                        somewhat well with CherryPy.

                    <p>
                        Still undecided what to do, I may know better in a few
                        days.
