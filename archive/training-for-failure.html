                On one level, he just seems to be saying that he wants schools
                to be harder to weed more people out. Sure, I think it's
                justifiable that you have to have a certain kind of intelligence
                to be a good programmer, and that it's good to identify people
                who will be most successful based on that. (Similarly, if you
                aren't getting enough majors, making sure people succede isn't
                the answer, rather finding the right people and attracting them
                to CS is the answer.)
            </p>
            <p>
                He's also arguing against vocational education (as Java has
                become a vocational skill), though that doesn't seem to be what
                people are picking up on. It makes sense that vocational
                education is part of the issue, because in vocational education
                it is expected <em>everyone</em> passes. You sign up, you pay
                your money, they graduate you, period. Unless you simply don't
                try, you <em>will</em> graduate, probably with any degree you
                want.
            </p>
            <p>
                There's always been schools like this, but they've become much
                much more common. Honestly I think we -- the programming
                community -- really should call out some of these schools as
                frauds. It makes me sad when I see an ad where somebody says how
                successful they are making computer games with their degree from
                DeVry. It's such obvious bullshit to me, which makes it more
                pathetic that kids are conned into this sort of thing. But
                that's an aside. The point is that the same thing is happening
                to more reputable universities, and what Joel is talking about
                is this trend. You pay your money, they make sure you get
                through school, and as long as you try you should get a B or
                better.
            </p>
            <p>
                But I'm not excited about the model that Joel wants -- one where
                you present these fairly small, quite mathematical, and fairly
                difficult concepts, and use that to eliminate students. It can
                <em>work</em>, sure, because those are useful and important
                skills that represent a useful talent; but they don't represent
                <em>all</em> the important skills and talents.
            </p>
            <p>
                I think it would be much more interesting if there was more of
                an emphasis on the <em>size</em> of the problems, not just a
                sampling of challenging techniques. Pointers and recursions are
                useful concepts for algorithms, but as a programmer writing
                algorithms is not central to what I do, nor is it completely
                clear without experience why you use those concepts. I'd rather
                have someone good at designing and understanding the larger
                systems of software, than someone who was just good at
                algorithms.
            </p>
            <p>
                We need to give students large projects, not just exercises and
                algorithms. Large projects aren't about pointers -- in fact, in
                a language with pointers it is unlikely that a new programmer
                will ever get far enough to encounter any of the
                <em>truly</em> interesting problems. And recursion is useful and
                important, but it's not a <em>prerequisite</em> for anything.
            </p>
            <p>
                These projects need to be large enough that the students will
                fail, regardless of their talent; hard enough that they'll fail
                in small ways (forced to throw away bad code and ideas), and
                ultimately in larger ways (likely creating a big, confusing,
                buggy system they can't maintain). All learning is best done
                through failure. Instead of Joel's model where failure is a way
                of weeding people out, failure should be seen as a requirement
                for learning. I learned <em>way</em> more in the programming I
                did outside of my schoolwork in college, because those tasks
                were ambitious and naive and prone to failure. Any passionate
                and talented programmer should be able to point to a pile of
                failed projects. If they haven't stopped learning -- and it's
                not okay to stop learning -- then that pile should be growing.
            </p>
            <p>
                But is this <em>really</em> good for employers? Maybe not. If
                schools don't produce passionless programmers who are afraid
                their inadequacies will be exposed, then who will work in the
                enterprise environments, who will write the accounting software,
                who will submit to using their B&amp;D languages and their
                top-down methodologies?
            </p>
            <p>
                Sorry, I've become snarky. But enterprise software aside, fear
                of inadequacy is a big problem. It's what makes people defensive
                and territorial and hard to work with. It makes people unwilling
                to learn new things, unable to guide themselves independently,
                unable to recognize their utility in the context of a team.
                Recognizing and becoming comfortable with one's own inadequacy
                -- for we are all inadequate -- is important. Humility is very
                freeing. I think schools should teach more of that.
            </p>
            <p>
                How can you interpret literature if you haven't written an
                angsty poem? How can you work in science if you haven't royally
                messed up an experiment, if you've never drawn the wrong
                conclusion? How can you practice mathematics if you haven't been
                convinced of a proof that later turned out to be wrong? How can
                you be a philosopher without believing firmly in something you
                later come to detest -- and moreso, having tried ernestly to
                convince others of that ill-considered idea? How can you be a
                musician without writing a sappy or derivative song? Even cello
                players should be forced to write at least one love song.
            </p>
            <p>
                So maybe that's what I'd ask of a prospective employee. Tell me
                about some of the things you failed at.

                    The Java schools that Joel Spoelsky writes about are simply
                    trying to maintain their existence by keeping student
                    numbers up as the overall market for programmers increases.
                    They are teaching what a former colleague used to call
                    &quot;programming with a trowel&quot;. Of course it's
                    getting harder to sort the wheat from the chaff, there are
                    just that many more people out there claiming to be
                    programmers. Ask the BDFL what he thinks of the skill levels
                    of the typical Bay area Java coder.
                </p>
                <p>
                    That's not to say that someone like Bruce Eckel couldn't
                    produce good Java, simply that there aren't that many
                    <em>good</em> Java programmers around. But then the overall
                    programming standard seems to have gone down as the
                    programmer base has increased, so Java is probably just the
                    populist end of this trend.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I think the most interesting part of your post is the bit
                    about fear of inadequacy. If students don't learn from
                    problems that make them aware of the possibility of failure
                    then they will probably not get as much out of their
                    attempts. However it's then very important to have a
                    supportive learning environment that will highlight their
                    successes and reference the failures simply as aspects of
                    further learning than as inadequacies in their approach.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It's still true that &quot;the person who never made a
                    mistake never made anything&quot;, but it's important to
                    encourage what we might call &quot;constructive
                    failure&quot;, and for that I don't think you can beat a
                    vocational education. In fact there's a lot to be said for
                    the old apprenticeship schemes: you were acknowledged to be
                    learning for five years and you had that length of time to
                    become competent - not a master, but someone who had the
                    capacity to turn into a master.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It's good to see Fog Creek are supporting an internship
                    program, and I hope that Google's experience with the summer
                    of code was good enough for them to think about running
                    something equally useful next year.

                        Well, part of the problem here is obviously Java. Most
                        really good programmers choose their language for the
                        language itself -- and they wind up with things like
                        Scheme, Ruby, or Python. People who are in programming
                        just for the money learn Java, Visual Basic, or C#. Paul
                        Graham's Python Paradox is that as Python grows in
                        popularity, the quality of Python programmers may
                        decline as people use it out of job requirement, not
                        desire to program in Python. (<a

                        Regarding apprenticeship -- the problem here is that a
                        lot of experienced programmers aren't good. Having 10
                        years of experience writing bad software is just that --
                        reinforcement of bad skills. The truly good programmers
                        don't always (but not never) have the aptitude for
                        guiding a creative skill. Joel himself comes to mind.

                        It's ironic that even as the video-game generation is
                        coming of age, the ranks of U.S. computer programmers
                        who create those games — plus more practical software —
                        are thinning out.

                        That's the basic idea behind Alice, a software program
                        developed at Carnegie Mellon University to ease students
                        into programming painlessly. Instead of meticulously
                        typing in lines of commands, the users of Alice 2.0
                        users move animated characters around the screen to tell
                        a story — kind of like playing &quot;The Sims.&quot;

                        with CMU to make Alice 3.0 even cooler — in an effort to
                        reverse the brain drain and particularly to get more

                        the next 18 to 24 months and give CMU free use of the

                        shabby. The object-oriented, Java-based programming
                        environment is already being used at more than 60
                        colleges and universities as well as an estimated 100
                        high schools and middle schools to teach introductory
                        computer courses. Two textbooks have been written based
                        on Alice 2.0, and Pausch said &quot;there'll be a
                        dozen&quot; once Version 3.0 comes out.

                        Alice.org Alice was created to get around the
                        frustrations that keeps many students from getting
                        beyond the intro classes — and in the longer run,
                        reverse a trend that has seen a 50 percent drop-off in
                        the number of computer science majors over the past five
                        years. Statistics also show a widening gap between male
                        and female interest in computer science.

                        With Alice, students start out with a natural-language,
                        drag-and-drop interface that puts colorful 3-D
                        characters through their computer-generated paces.
                        Instead of typing lines of Java code like this: public
                        static void moveTo(Thing t, Map m, int tx, int ty ) {
                        ... you just move your mouse or type in commands like
                        &quot;rotate one left quarter turn.&quot; The idea is
                        that Alice can lay a fun foundation for future computer
                        courses.

                        &quot;The new version that we're now beginning on will
                        gradually morph into a more traditional Java programming
                        environment,&quot; Pausch said. &quot;So we're talking
                        about the training wheels gradually dropping off.&quot;

                        Alice emphasizes a storytelling approach to building a
                        program, rather than a shoot-'em-up approach. &quot;We
                        found that when we targeted Alice as a storytelling
                        vehicle, girls were three times as likely to be engaged
                        and motivated to write computer software, as opposed to
                        just moving 3-D characters around,&quot; Pausch

                        appealed to Electronic Arts, Pausch said. He and his
                        colleagues at CMU have been working with Electronic Arts
                        for years, and the company has agreed to hire 10
                        students from CMU's computer science program annually. A
                        couple of years ago, Pausch spent a months-long
                        sabbatical at Electronic Arts, and the executives there
                        were particularly intrigued to hear of Alice's success
                        with middle-school girls.

                        creative officer, said in Friday's announcement.
                        &quot;Inspiring next-generation game-makers is a primary
                        objective. Alice has already proven to be a powerful
                        tool to engage all kids — most particularly girls. Our

                        The terms of the deal call for EA to contribute its

                        which is distributed freely by CMU. &quot;The way this
                        license works is, if somebody picks up the open-source
                        Alice and the 'Sims' data, they can't do anything with
                        that that isn't noncommercial educational use,&quot;
                        Pausch explained.

                    <p>
                        That means Electronic Arts won't be offering a souped-up
                        commercial version of the program — and Pausch
                        acknowledged the deal also means neither he nor CMU will
                        profit from Alice 3.0. &quot;Put the handcuffs on
                        me,&quot; he said jokingly.

                        &quot;We all want kids, particularly middle-school

                    There are a couple levels at play in Joel's essay. By
                    programming exclusively in Java, he asserts that it is
                    extremely hard for a hiring manager to quickly assess a
                    potential hire's skills. This is not something exclusive to
                    external assessment; it's a problem for the nascent
                    programmer to assess himself. Schools can capitalize on this
                    by keeping poorer programmers in their program, and these
                    poorer programmers cannot tell that they are poor at it.
                    This is unfair to the student during the process, and unfair
                    to the hiring manager later. Is this because the failures
                    are minimized?
                </p>
                <p>
                    To take an analogy of cooking, with only limited ingredients
                    and extremely helpful tools (imagine a pan that won't burn
                    anything), how can you identify the great cooks, the good
                    cooks, and the mediocre cooks? In school it's more important
                    whether I can improve my skills. For the hiring manager it's
                    often more about which level of skill I possess - or at
                    least where I max out. But unless it can be usefully
                    measured, how will any of us know?
                </p>
                <p>
                    I agree Joel's essay oversimplifies in the implication that
                    algorithms and pointers are necessarily the hard part, and
                    that competence in the hard parts can predict the overall
                    competence. I think they're strong markers, and much more
                    easily measured than some idea of code quality, but they're
                    still not ideal or fully representative markers.

                    I took a total of 6 computer science credits en route to my
                    B.A. in Anthropology and, forgive my immodesty, I think I do
                    really well as a programmer.

                <p>
                    Heck, the three best programmers I've had the pleasure of
                    working with are college <em>dropouts</em>. And the worst
                    developer I currently work with has an M.S. in Comp Sci from
                    Stanford (that would be pretty awkward if she read this).

                    I also think part of the irony of Joel's article is that
                    Frogcreek developers little more than massively
                    overglorified CRUD software, of which any punk kid could
                    probably churn out faster than Joel himself. :) But that's
                    my opinion as a Python programmer who avoids C like the
                    plague.

                        I was going to say &quot;hey, good CRUD software is
                        still good software.&quot; (And I havn't used FogBugz,
                        but it sounds like it works well.) But then I thought,
                        why would you ever be handling pointers in a CRUD
                        application like what FogBugz? Of course, that's not
                        really his point either -- it's not that pointers are
                        the skill Joel cares about, it's that pointers represent
                        some skill he cares about, presumably one that indicates
                        an unteachable talent. You might then ask if that
                        unteachable talent is the most important unteachable
                        talent for the kind of applications Fog Creek develops.
                        I guess I'm just arguing it is not, since their software
                        is not algorithmically complex (like most software), and
                        pointers don't indicate a talent that is particularly
                        closely associated with software design at the
                        CRUD-level. And really CRUD apps are apps that use very
                        high level constructs (a database) to get you closer to
                        what (IMHO) are more interesting problems -- they aren't
                        really <em>easier</em> applications, except insofar as
                        you don't make life unnecessarily harder for yourself.

                            worked in noisy, un-appreciative environments, I
                            think even 10 points on Joel's Test would be a great
                            offer.

                            Their products really don't feel like the hottest
                            and sexiest projects to work on. But what I've heard
                            about them is that most of FogCreek's users really
                            love FogCreek's products.

                            (It's funny though now that Joel is also a Paul
                            Graham fanboy and Paul keeps touting how no self
                            respecting hacker would ever work on Windows. I
                            wouldn't object working on Windows, but it would be
                            a little minus nevertheless.)

                    &gt;It makes me sad when I see an ad where somebody says how
                    successful they are making computer games with their degree
                    from DeVry. It's such obvious bullshit to me, which makes it
                    more pathetic that kids are conned into this sort of thing.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Actually some very sharp people come out of technical
                    schools like DeVry. Some focused people want to get straight
                    to the relevant stuff rather than spend 2 years on general
                    ed fluff. Which isn't to say gen ed can't be useful, but
                    truthfully, you won't even remember 90% of it after you
                    graduate.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Sure, there will be washouts, but the same thing goes for
                    most colleges. The point is that having a degree from a
                    technical school is not an indicator of a sub-par technical
                    education.
