                I've been thinking about how it should work. And I really don't
                know -- it's all very vague. Much more vague than it should be.
                HTTP won't be a

                    class="reference"
                    href="http://blog.duncandavidson.com/2006/06/the_web_is_a_pi.html"
                    >pipe</a
                >
                if we have to rely on ad hoc configuration everywhere.
            </p>
            <p>Some of the issues...</p>
            <div class="section">
                <h1><a id="host" name="host">Host</a></h1>
                <p>
                    Some information gets covered up. For instance, in many HTTP
                    proxying situations the Host header is lost; changed into
                    <tt class="docutils literal"
                        ><span class="pre">localhost</span></tt
                    >
                    or something that doesn't accurately represent the initial
                    request. I guess there's an informal standard that
                    <tt class="docutils literal"
                        ><span class="pre">X-Forwarded-Server</span></tt
                    >
                    contains the original Host value.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Also the remote IP address is lost, but there's a more
                    widely used convention to put that information in
                    <tt class="docutils literal"
                        ><span class="pre">X-Forwarded-For</span></tt
                    >. This seems much less interesting than Host to me, but
                    much more widely supported. Go figure.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I don't know of any standards that exist for remapping
                    request paths. I guess in theory you shouldn't need to do
                    this, but in practice it is pretty common. For instance,
                    lets say you want to map
                    <tt class="docutils literal"
                        ><span class="pre">/blog/*</span></tt
                    >
                    to
                    <tt class="docutils literal"
                        ><span class="pre">localhost:9999</span></tt
                    >
                    where your blog app is running in a separate process. Do you
                    preserve the full path? Do you duplicate any configuration
                    for path mappings or virtual host settings in that server on
                    port 9999? All too often the target server isn't very
                    cooperative about this, and various
                    <a
                        class="reference"
                        href="http://httpd.apache.org/docs/1.3/mod/mod_rewrite.html"

                    emerge to work around the problems. Ideally I think it would
                    be good to give three pieces of information for the path:
                </p>
                <ol class="arabic simple">
                    <li>
                        The resource the upstream server expects to handle this
                        request.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The base path that the upstream server used to determine
                        what resource should handle the request.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The rest of the path, which is the responsibility of the
                        downstream server.
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    2 and 3 are similar to
                    <tt class="docutils literal"
                        ><span class="pre">SCRIPT_NAME</span></tt
                    >
                    and
                    <tt class="docutils literal"
                        ><span class="pre">PATH_INFO</span></tt
                    >. 1 is something new. HTTP always leaves these all squished
                    together.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Also: potentially the request path has <em>nothing</em> to
                    do with the original path or domain. This can happen when
                    you are aggregating pieces of data from many sources (e.g.,
                    using
                    <a
                        class="reference"
                        href="http://httpd.apache.org/docs/1.3/mod/mod_include.html"
                        >SSIs</a
                    >, which get pieces of content as subrequests, or
                    <a
                        class="reference"
                        href="http://www.mnot.net/javascript/hinclude/"
                        >HInclude</a
                    >
                    which composes content in the client). If the output uses
                    HTML then that HTML needs to be written either with
                    <em>no</em> assumptions about what URL it is rendered under
                    (i.e., all links are fully qualified), or it needs to be
                    smart about the real context it will be rendered in. How to
                    write relocatable HTML is a separate issue, but there also
                    doesn't seem to be any conventions about how to tell the web
                    app about the indirection that is happening.

            <div class="section">
                <h1>
                    <a
                        id="all-the-other-information"

                <p>
                    There's a lot more information that can be passed through.
                    For instance, the upstream server may have authenticated the
                    request already. How does it pass that information through?
                    Maybe there's other ad hoc information. For instance,
                    consider this rewrite rule:
                </p>
                <pre class="literal-block">
RewriteCond %{HTTP:Host} ^(.*)\.myblogs.com$
RewriteRule (.*) http://localhost:9999/blogapp/$1?username=%1 [P,QSA]
</pre
                >
                <p>
                    If you aren't familiar with mod_rewrite, this tells Apache
                    to take a request like
                    <tt class="docutils literal"
                        ><span class="pre"
                            >http://bob.myblogs.com/archive?month=1</span
                        ></tt
                    >
                    and forward it to
                    <tt class="docutils literal"
                        ><span class="pre"
                            >http://localhost:999/blogapp/archive?month=1&amp;username=bob</span
                        ></tt
                    >
                </p>
                <p>This kind of works, but is clearly hacky.</p>
                <p>
                    Ideally we would pass a header like
                    <tt class="docutils literal"
                        ><span class="pre">X-Blog-Username:</span>
                        <span class="pre">bob</span></tt
                    >. But that opens up other issues...
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="section">
                <h1>
                    <a
                        id="security-of-piped-information"
                        name="security-of-piped-information"
                        >Security of piped information</a

                </h1>
                <p>
                    We can start adding headers willy-nilly, and that's actually
                    okay, but opens up security concerns. If you aren't certain
                    that only trusted clients can access your backend server,
                    can you really trust the headers? It's no good if anyone can
                    connect to your server with
                    <tt class="docutils literal"
                        ><span class="pre">X-Remote-User:</span>
                        <span class="pre">admin</span></tt
                    >
                    and then you trust that information. With no concept of
                    trusted and untrusted headers, we have to rely on ad hoc
                    configuration for security. This is both difficult to setup
                    and maintain, and doing it wrong can lead to a very insecure
                    setup.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The previous issues can all be resolved with conventions
                    about new HTTP headers. This one is much harder.

                    I'd like to use HTTP like a pipe. Really! None of the issues
                    I've brought up are new, but they also aren't well answered
                    despite their age. In comparison, FastCGI and SCGI actually
                    answer most of these problems <em>right now</em>.

                <p>
                    If we're going to use HTTP this way -- and there's great
                    reasons to start doing this -- we need to work harder at
                    coming up with a good answer for these kinds of issues.

                    I can only see two viable options to trusting data in
                    headers/urls, share a secret and sign the header with that
                    (a simple example would be to just to set the authorization
                    header for the backend, but that requires that the backend
                    have some sort of authentication system in place to check
                    the data) or only allow requests to from trusted
                    servers/ports.

                    The security problem doesn't seem to have much to do with
                    HTTP headers, really. If your back-end server is open to the
                    network, the entire content of each request is suspect,
                    right?
                </p>
                <p>
                    You need authentication; and you need to secure the channel
                    from snooping and tampering. Each of these three facets of
                    the problem has to be enforced in some protocol layer.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Take authentication. You need to: (a) stack HTTP on top of a
                    network-level protocol that authenticates; <em>OR</em> (b)
                    use some hypothetical flavor of HTTP authentication that's
                    actually secure; <em>OR</em> (c) stack another
                    authentication-capable protocol on top of HTTP--you know,
                    SOAP with digital signatures or whatever they're doing these
                    days.

                    <li>
                        doesn't exist, and everyone knows (c) is immoral, so
                        take (a). This is the &quot;don't do that&quot;
                        solution. Just do exactly what you said you weren't
                        going to do, and firewall off the back-end server. There
                        are several ways to do it--SSL; SSH (?); checking
                        getpeername(); moving the back-end server to another
                        machine behind a physical firewall; VMware... some of
                        which have performance problems, and some of which are
                        only secure given certain prerequisites. You can pick
                        one way that will work everywhere; or you can have your
                        system choose the best way dynamically; or you can push
                        the burden of configuring all the pieces to talk
                        together onto the user.

                <p>
                    Or take tampering. You need to: (a) stack HTTP on top of a
                    protocol that provides a no-tampering guarantee;
                    <em>or</em> (b) use some hypothetical HTTP feature that
                    prevents tampering, like adding an HTTP header with a
                    digitally signed hash of the message; <em>or</em> (c) stack
                    another protocol on top of HTTP. Again with the SOAP.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Etc. The world of (a) contains multitudes, with no means of
                    interoperability; the standards for (b) simply doesn't have
                    the features you need; and the stuff at level (c) is
                    despised by all right-thinking persons.
