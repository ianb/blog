</div><h1>Python Unicode Doesn't Really Suck</h1>
 
<div class="document">
<p>I realized I was maybe a bit inflamatory in <a class="reference" href="why-python-unicode-sucks.html">that other post's title</a>.  Python Unicode doesn't suck.  Except in one big way, that I
explain in that post.  I know a lot of thought went into Python's
Unicode support; while it misses the mark in this one way, it gets a lot of
things right.  In fact, if it didn't get those things right, I don't
think the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">sys.setdefaultencoding</span></tt> hack would work as well as I
think it will.  It's only so frustrating because it's so close!</p>
