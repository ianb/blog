        <div class="document">
            <p>
                The Python code documentation systems available are...
                scattered. And not very good. And definitely not well
                maintained. Lately when I see a hard problem that isn't getting
                solved well, I like to think of smaller problems that maybe
                could be solved.
            </p>
            <p>
                Here's a rough outline of what I think a Python documentation
                generation system should look like:
            </p>
            <ul class="simple">
                <li>
                    It should be <em>distribution oriented</em>, not module
                    oriented. That means it works on a package that gets
                    distributed, not on specific Python modules. So no separate
                    command-line tools, and options should be in
                    <tt class="docutils literal"
                        ><span class="pre">setup.cfg</span></tt
                    >.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Extraction should be pluggable in some form. The extraction
                    should produce something HTML-like, except without any
                    attention paid to styling. There may be several extractors;
                    e.g., one to format source code, another to create graphs of
                    relations, another to extract docstrings, another to render
                    the static files. Lots of people have written this part, and
                    it's hard, and it will keep being rewritten for a while.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Then a multi-stage rendering system.
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            One stage is resolving links between documents. So I
                            should be able to link to
                            <tt class="docutils literal"
                                ><span class="pre"
                                    >paste.fixture.TestApp</span
                                ></tt
                            >
                            and have it work, without having to worry what file
                            that documentation is going to appear in (or if it
                            is combined with other documentation in a file and
                            referenced with an anchor). A fancier system would
                            allow inter-project linking, but this is much more
                            complex.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Producing indexes and navigation (table-of-content
                            style) is another stage. The navigation that is
                            presented on every page should probably just be
                            maintained manually.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Applying a template is a final stage. Many systems
                            have an essentially hardcoded template, or hidden.
                            The interior content is harder to customize in
                            general, but simply allowing the wrapper to be
                            easily customized would be really helpful.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                I prefer a system based on static publishing because it's easy
                to maintain, and works well with systems like SourceForge. But
                in theory pieces of this system could be dynamic.
            </p>
            <p>
                This bears some similarity to how
                <a class="reference" href="http://effbot.org/zone/pythondoc.htm"
                    >PythonDoc</a
                >
                is laid out, but it hasn't been clear to me how that project
                fits all these pieces together. Also some portions don't seem
                pluggable; e.g., it prefers its own markup. But that might be a
                misperception.

                    I think the issue is that you can't really generate useful
                    documentation from code, so I think any system designed to
                    do so will be only slightly useful at best. I'd rather spend
                    my time on quality hand-written docs and let those
                    interested in details just read the source.

                        I think reference documentation taken from docstrings
                        can be useful in some situations. It's also way easier
                        to keep accurate in my experience. All of which isn't to
                        say that it is or should be the complete documentation.
                        This is why the factoring I propose has documentation
                        generated from multiple sources, including static text,
                        and potentially text in different formatters. So a
                        document extractor looks at the source and gets
                        docstrings and maybe comments and whatnot. Another looks
                        for .txt files, and maybe renders them via some
                        configured markup (reST, Markdown, etc). Another might
                        just pass through already-written HTML. This factoring
                        doesn't propose any one right way to get the content, or
                        even that one project will use just one content
                        generator.

                        and some of its beautiful output, I'd opine that
                        documentation, like the code itself, requires effort,
                        and is worth it.

                            Note that there is a CWEB-tool written in Python

                            It supports code written in Python and several other
                            languages and it also supports several variations of
                            CWEB-like systems. One really nice thing about using
                            LEO is that you can keep adding documentation as you
                            work. No need for a separate history file. This does
                            mean that you end up with code that has huge amounts
                            of comments, but since 99% of the time you are
                            running from .pyc files, it doesn't matter. And
                            since LEO allows you to structure your documentation
                            in any way you want, you can do things like
                            integrate bugfix documentation into the document
                            set. If you see that a particular file was modified
                            to fix bug X-301 then you can easily look up bug
                            x-301 and see what files were affected and what
                            notes the programmer added.

                    This is a typical problem with FOSS, and one worth solving
                    well, otherwise there'll just continue to be many fragmented
                    solutions. I think the future lies in integrating code,
                    developer documentation, tests, and requirements in such as
                    way that there's minimal duplication.

                    My pydoctor tool (google for it...) does some of this, but
                    hardly all of it. It's mainly targeted at documenting
                    twisted so far, and you can see its documentation for that

                    It works by analyzing a bunch of modules or packages into
                    this fairly large ball of information called a
                    &quot;System&quot; (which can be pickled) and then working
                    over that to produce HTML. It's at least somewhat pluggable.
                    It supports epytext (epydoc's markup system) in docstrings,
                    and you can use that to link to stuff reasonably freely.

                    I hadn't thought about integrating it into distutils before,
                    that's quite a neat idea.
