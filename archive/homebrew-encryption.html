        <h1>Homebrew encryption</h1>
        <p>
            I wrote a simple cryptographic algorithm this evening. Specifically
            it is meant to encrypt passwords into cookies, to allow for
            persistent logins. These were some of the requirements that made me
            want to roll my own:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                Not too many requirements. Preferably nothing outside the
                standard library. No
                <a href="http://www.amk.ca/python/code/crypto.html">pycrypto</a>
                or <a href="http://sandbox.rulemaker.net/ngps/m2/">M2Crypto</a>.
                (<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/pyaes/">this</a> would
                probably be okay, though)
            </li>

            <li>
                Creates compact encrypted text. This has to fit into a cookie
                reliably. I'm hoping for no more than 40 bytes of overhead.
            </li>

            <li>
                Runs reasonably fast. I'm not sure if this really matters, but I
                have noticed that AES in Python is noticeably slow.
            </li>

            <li>Is secure.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            Maybe this already exists, but most of the algorithms I've seen
            either aren't secure (e.g.,
            <a href="http://python.org/doc/current/lib/module-rotor.html"
                >rotor</a
            >) or aren't compact. And anyway, it seemed fun. I'd be very curious
            if anyone sees particular vulnerabilities with this algorithm
            (besides the fact that it should only encrypt short plaintexts). The
            code is in
            <a
                href="http://www.webwareforpython.org/~ianb/w4py.org/Wiki/lib/simplecrypt.py"
                >simplecrypt.py</a
            >. The algorithm:
        </p>

        <p>
            First take the <i>plaintext</i> and encode it so that it is of
            minimum length and aligned in some way. By default it must be 10
            characters long, and aligned to the next 5 characters (e.g., a 12
            byte string becomes 15 bytes). Random characters are added to the
            end, and at least one random character is always used. We add a
            leading character telling what the actual length of the string is.
            (This way a very short password will not appear particularly short
            when encrypted.) This is the <i>encoded plaintext</i>.
        </p>

        <p>
            Take a hash of the <i>encoded plaintext</i> and the <i>key</i>,
            possibly truncating it to save space. We will call this hash the
            <i>signature</i>.
        </p>

        <p>
            Take an sha hash of the <i>signature</i> and the <i>key</i>. This
            hash will be the <i>encoding key</i>.
        </p>

        <p>
            XOR the <i>encoding key</i> with the <i>encoded plaintext</i>.
            Prepend the <i>signature</i>. This is the full <i>ciphertext</i>.
        </p>

        <p>
            Reverse the steps to decrypt. I use the
            <a href="http://python.org/doc/current/lib/module-sha.html">SHA</a>
            hash, which is 20 characters long. I think any plaintext over 20
            characters could be vulnerable, since we have to reuse the encoding
            key when XORing it with the plaintext, and patterns may emerge.
        </p>

        <p>
            Anyway, this seemed pretty simple, and seems to fit the bill. Am I
            missing anything?
        </p>

            Remember that (A XOR C) XOR (B XOR C) is A XOR B, so yes, even a

            Why aren't you just using HMAC? You probably already have a library
            for it...

            <br />
            I notice that I've acquired the habit of twitching violently when
            anyone says something like "homebrew encryption." I wonder where I
            picked that up.

            Python 2.2 does indeed have an hmac library -- I hadn't noticed it
            before. But I don't see how it changes much -- HMAC just seems to be
            a way to sign things, and an HMAC is not noticeably different than
            hashing the concatenation of the key and plaintext (except it
            standardizes aspects). Standardizing my homebrew encryption isn't
            that important ;)
            <br />

            <br />
            Note that the key is in all cases secret, and is not reused. So (A
            XOR C) XOR (B XOR C) wouldn't happen -- i.e., someone couldn't
            submit a known plaintext (B), and use that to decode (A XOR C),
            since the two messages would actually be (A XOR C1) and (B XOR C2).
            But I think if, say, you had a 200 character plaintext, and a 20
            character hash, you could potentially find out what the hash is,
            since character 1, 21, 41, 61, 81, 101, 121, 141, 161, and 181 would
            have been XORed with the same value, and you could start to guess
            (using knowledge about the likely distribution of characters) what
            that value of the key/mask had been. This would still only allow you
            to break that one message -- the key would remain secret even after
            a successful brute-force attack of this style.

            A SHA hash is a one way function. Why go through an encryption
            scheme, when no one can really get back to the original password?
            Use a SHA1 hash of the password and be done with it.

            Because hashed passwords are hard to work with. Frequently a
            password is stored in a hashed form, so you'd have to be sure to
            hash the cookie in the exact same way, or do some sort of
            double-hashing. There are also many situations where you need the
            actual password to authenticate the person.
            <br />

            <br />
            I have thought about storing some more arbitrary authentication,
            though -- basically hashing the username with a secret key. Then
            this would take the place of a password -- we'd rely on the fact
            that sometime in the past (when we originally set the cookie) the
            user had authenticated themself, and this the signed hash proves it
            is the same user. (Well, actually just the same browser, but that's
            a different issue)
            <br />

            <br />
            If you store the password you also allow a person to implicitly
            invalidate persistent logins by changing the account's password.

            Never, ever, write your own encryption algorithm and assume it's
            secure. It never is. Try using one of the existing, proven ones. And
            keep the key secure.

            might be a good bet. It's faster than AES/rijndael, and pretty
            secure.

            But Blowfish turns my iddy bitty 8-character password into 118
            characters! Looking at the cookie standards, that's still well
            within the size limit, so maybe that's not so bad. Well, maybe
            that's not even true, it seems to be a particular implementation of
            Blowfish, which may be adding filename, a hash, and other
            information to the encrypted stream. The raw algorithm seems to
            cause little expansion (using this module:

            It might make it a bit more secure if you put the random chars at
            the begining instead of at the end.
            <br />

            <br />
            But I think for any real security, one should use a proven
            algorythm.
            <br />

            <br />
            I like this though because its light weight and would provide enough
            security as needed non widespread use, certain situations.
            <br />

            <br />

            <br />
            I tried to make one similar myself for storing passwords in
            inifiles, but I couldn't make it as secure as I wanted, so I just
            stored them xored with the repeating username then base64 encoded.
            (Oh no now my secrets out!)
            <br />

            <br />
            No flames for the above insecure algorythm please, its just a step
            up from plain text It's just to protect against nosey pc repair
            guys. Even if they get the password, they have to build a twisted PB
            program to use it, and as soon as they do we'll know and change it.
            <br />

            <br />
            Now that I've shared this info, I think I'll have to start using
            blowfish or something!. I think I'll use the hash of the username
            appended with a hardcoded key.
            <br />

            <br />
            Thanks for sharing your algorythm.

            I've found that security via obscurity seems to be the only way to
            deal with some situations, particularly when you have a program that
            stores a password and needs to be able to get the plaintext password
            on its own, as in a client that does something on behalf of some
            user. You can use whatever encryption, but it doesn't really matter,
            because on some level you have a plaintext key. Passwords are secure
            only because our brains are an exceptionally obscure storage medium.
            <br />

            <br />
            This is why DRM schemes are breakable -- it's certainly not that the
            designers don't understand encryption algorithms (DVD's CSS aside).

            Speed should not be an important requirement especially for small
            messages of the kind found in cookies. For less than a couple
            hundred bytes... speed won't matter.

            I've seen performance issues when encrypting credit card numbers, so
            speed is definitely a concern. That was public-key encryption, which
            is typically much slower, but I've noticed similar issues with the
            pure-Python AES implementation.

            BUT why send the password in the cookie in the first place. It is so
            much easier (and IMHO more secure) to just store the password
            locally and send a session id in the cookie. That way you have the
            possibility to add more 'cookie' data as you go along without having
            to send it all in a cookie.
            <br />
            Beats encryption anytime.
