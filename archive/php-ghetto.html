                    >Stephen Thorn posted a note about a PHPXMLRPC exploit</a
                >. Whenever I see such things, I try to figure out what
                implementation would cause that. At first I was baffled, but
                then I realized that the XMLRPC parser created an array of
                arguments, then created the text of the function call somehow
                like
                <tt class="docutils literal"
                    ><span class="pre">&quot;$method_name($param1,</span>
                    <span class="pre">$param2,</span>
                    <span class="pre">...)&quot;</span></tt
                >
                and used
                <a
                    class="reference"
                    href="http://us3.php.net/manual/en/function.eval.php"
                    >eval</a
                >
                on it (instead of
                <a

                    href="http://us3.php.net/manual/en/function.call-user-func-array.php"

                <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">eval</span></tt>
                page doesn't give any warning about how dangerous the function
                is. It's the fault of the person who wrote PHPXMLRPC for being
                really dumb -- the code isn't just insecure, it's really buggy
                too. It's the fault of anyone who used the library for paying
                <em>no</em> attention to the code (or apparently ever testing
                the code with even slightly creative input).

                -- the code in question seems confusing and indirect enough that
                I don't understand exactly why it does what it does, or how it
                would be fixed.
            </p>
            <p>
                Someone could have written the exact same code in Python. Python
                has the same functions. And yet I almost never come upon code
                like this in Python. If anyone posted code like this in Python,
                someone would immediately bonk them on the head for their
                stupidity. Even if they wrote confusing code like in this case,
                people would know enough to see
                <tt class="docutils literal"
                    ><span class="pre">eval()</span></tt

                applies here. PHP is such a load of crap, right down to the
                standard library, that it creates a culture where it's
                acceptable to write horrible code. The bugs and security holes
                are so common, it doesn't seem so important to keep everything
                in order and audited. Fixes get applied wholesale, with
                monstrosities like
                <a

                -- sure some apps get messed up, but maybe you catch a few
                attacks in the process. It's what happened when the language
                designers gave up. Maybe with PHP 5 they are trying to clean up
                the neighborhood, but that doesn't change the fact when you
                program in PHP you are programming in a dump.

            <div class="document">
                <p>
                    As Python programmers, we should be a little bit careful to
                    point the finger. After all, it wasn't too long ago that we
                    also had a security hole in the Python XML-RPC server code
                    included with the actual Python distribution. Granted, the
                    Python problem was in part of the code which wouldn't have
                    been commonly used, and was a bit more involved than
                    inappropriate use of eval, but .... ;-)
                </p>
                <p>
                    In some respects, one could say the problem really lies with
                    RPC protocols where a server implementer tries to be smart
                    and provide some measure of automagic unmarshalling,
                    traversal and dispatching. Unless they have a thorough
                    knowledge of the ins and outs of the implementation language
                    and supporting infrastructure, it can be all too easy to
                    screw up at some point, with it not being detected that
                    there is a problem until quite some time later. Because the
                    point of the XML-RPC protocol is to allow remote access, any
                    security problem is made worse because of the fact that the
                    service is public to start with.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The same also holds to a degree with web frameworks which
                    provide automagic object traversal to map a URL against a
                    resource. Many Python web frameworks have this sort of
                    feature and not all use an explicit mechanism to say what is
                    visible. As a consequence you can get security problems in
                    Python web frameworks along the same lines as the XML-RPC
                    server problem that occurred in Python. In fact, it was the
                    problem initially found in mod_python that led onto the
                    similar problem being found in the Python XML-RPC server
                    code.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Thus, PHP may be a worse base from which to start with, but
                    Python also has a few dark and obscure corners. There are
                    probably just a lot less of them in Python and they are
                    harder to find. I do note though that Python programmers
                    also seem to be less willing to accept that Python code
                    could have security problems. The initial reactions when
                    trying to find an appropriate forum to send details of the
                    Python XML-RPC server problems gave testament to that. :-(

                    <p>
                        Certainly this all can, and sometimes does, happen in
                        Python. All the mechanisms that cause problems in PHP
                        exist in Python, and I've seen people abuse them in very
                        similar ways. But I see a much stronger emphasis on
                        correcting problems and avoiding the same problem in the
                        future. My initial impression of this bug was that it
                        had something to do with the same problem as SQL
                        injections (<tt class="docutils literal"
                            ><span class="pre">&quot;blah</span>
                            <span class="pre">'$string'&quot;</span></tt
                        >), but once I saw the actual code it was more
                        complicated than that. It should have raised flags --
                        being complicated and using a dangerous construct -- but
                        it wasn't blindingly obvious.

                    <p>
                        Though perhaps what surprised me more was that the code
                        was just really really buggy, and no one noticed. It
                        wouldn't accept any XMLRPC request that contained a
                        string with
                        <tt class="docutils literal"
                            ><span class="pre">'</span></tt

                        in it. Geez. Anyone with the name O'Something must curse
                        PHP, because PHP really hates that character.

                        Such incidents <em>should</em> be finger-pointed. Not
                        long ago there was a similar case in libpng (i think,
                        some lib for graphics anyway). The problem was braindead
                        code which had a buffer overflows. As a consequence if
                        your web browser used that library, downloading and
                        displaying an image from the internet could execute code
                        on your computer!

                    <p>
                        At the time I thought this was intentional and that the
                        person who wrote that library was a script kiddie who
                        wanted a backdoor. Such cases should be punished imo.
                        Finger-pointing and blacklisting is fair for such
                        stupendous code. The people who write it should not be
                        trusted for some years.

                    I don't think that's fair. Do you think it's reasonable to
                    expect people to audit every single module (even widely-used
                    ones) they use? (I'm not talking about a software utopia
                    where we have unlimited time and manpower; I'm talking about
                    the real world where people have tight deadlines and code
                    reuse is a lifesaver.)

                        In isolation, sure things get overlooked. But such a
                        core library for so long? (Well, kind of core; PEAR has
                        a forked version which I presume was fixed earlier --
                        but why didn't that fix get pushed back to PHPXMLRPC?) I
                        accept that one person might use it unwittingly, but the
                        projects Stephen lists are large projects and they
                        really should be paying more attention. Also, if this
                        were the first bug like this, then it would be
                        understandable. But the PHP community should have
                        already learned its lesson on things like this.

                        anyone is getting punished for this; assigning blame is
                        purely for kicks. I don't think the original developer
                        deserves all the blame; they did the work and tried. It
                        was sloppy work, but supposedly one of the benefits of
                        releasing your code is that other people will look at
                        it. It took too long for that to happen in this case.

                    Well if there were anywhere near as many people writing
                    Python as PHP, especially on cheap shared hosting plans you
                    would probably see just as much crap in Python. The fact
                    that Python (and many others) possess a relatively high
                    barrier to entry drastically cuts down on the likelihood of
                    this IMHO. I mean, would you want to regularly use or browse
                    a site written with Python CGI compared to the relative
                    speed of PHP? Most people don't, so PHP is used.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If mod_(python|perl|ruby|etc) were as prevalent as mod_php
                    there'd be travesties such as this in them too. Now if you
                    want to argue that higher barrier to entry is
                    <em>a good thing</em>, and/or mod_php shouldn't be deployed
                    all over on shared hosts, I think that's a different topic.

                        That explains why there's such a multitude of such
                        problems in various PHP programs -- and there is a huge

                            Agreed -- I was addressing the larger point of the
                            overall quality level of most PHP code out there.
                            But as mentioned above by jfj, this is hardly the
                            exclusive domain of PHP - libpng had a huge hole[s],
                            and check out the vendor list of products that lib

                    Hmm, yes, there are stupid things in PHP. There are stupid
                    things in Python. There are stupid things in Java. And so
                    forth. PHP in itself is not evil. People tend to think that
                    PHP is evil because it let you do evil things. Hogwash!
                    Point me to any framework / language / OS that doesn't let
                    you do evil things. Blame developers of said tool, not the
                    tool itself. PHP done right can be truly beautiful.

                    I can understand the frustration that a popular module used
                    for some time can turn out to be utter garbage, but hey, it
                    <em>is</em> open-source, a world where good-enough can last
                    you a long time until someone sits down and solve the
                    problem once and for all some other better way. Feel free to
                    jump in. It is all about ideas and developers, not tools.

                        That's my point -- everything that was misused in PHP
                        exists in Python. It's not PHP-the-language at fault,
                        it's PHP-the-community or

                        I have major problems with PHP, I have a list somewhere
                        of the things I hate the most about the language, which
                        I really should dig up and blog about now that I don't
                        work where I used to work anymore.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To give you an idea of the fundamental breakage that PHP
                        gives us, let me show you why I hate the language.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To write an SQL query in PHP, there are two popular
                        methods. One is an easy way, the other is the RIGHT way.
                        Let me show you.
                    </p>
                    <p>Easy Way:</p>
                    <pre class="literal-block">
mysql_query(&quot;UPDATE users SET age='$age' WHERE id = '$id'&quot;);
</pre
                    >
                    <p>Right Way:</p>
                    <pre class="literal-block">
if (get_magic_quotes_gpc()) {
  $age = stripslashes($age);
}
mysql_query(&quot;UPDATE users SET age='&quot;.mysql_real_quote_string($age).&quot;' WHERE id = '&quot;.mysql_real_quote_string($id).&quot;'&quot;);
</pre
                    >
                    <p>
                        So PHP gives you a choice, use the easy to use
                        &quot;string $interpolation&quot; syntax provided by the
                        language, or write correct code. You can immediately see
                        why there are so many security problems in PHP.

                            I hate to say this, but that's a pretty stupid
                            argument. If your syntax for doing things the right
                            way is long or complex, abstract it, wrap around it,
                            fiddle with it, chuck it in a function or fold it to
                            an object or obfuscate it in a Perl module or
                            however else you'd like to make things simpler. This
                            is what programming is all about, no? This is why
                            annotations are popular. This is why Groovy is
                            groovy. This is why Python is cool and Ruby shines.
                            And it's why PHP isn't as bad as the PHP developer.
