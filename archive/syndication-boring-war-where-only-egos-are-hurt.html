            everytime I realized I had to apply HTML quoting, I would have gray
            hair and ulcers by now. To summarize the silent data loss in
            question: Reuters has text like &quot;Enron Corp.
            &lt;ENRNQ.PK&gt;&quot; in their feed, and all aggregators treat the
            description as HTML, and so it gets interpreted as HTML with a
            &lt;ENRNQ.PK&gt; tag in it.
        </p>
        <p>
            The silly part is that RSS 2.0, lame though it is, clearly has a
            standard in this case. Like the
            <a href="http://www.intertwingly.net/blog/2004/05/28/detente"
                >article says</a
            >
            it wasn't that <i>some</i> aggregators had a problem -- they all
            did. Which is to say, according to the functional, implemented RSS
            standard (embodied in the aggregators, not the spec), the Reuters
            feed was incorrect. It was not &quot;invalid&quot;, it was
            semantically incorrect. Such bugs should be familiar to any working
            programmer.

            Oh well. In the end it's all pretty boring. Sorry for wasting your

            Atom would cause silent data loss too, if you did what that feed is
            (effectively) doing:
            <br />

            The required unique universal ID also makes Atom depart from the

            I thought the point was that with Atom, there's no question that
            Phillip's example is incorrect: run that through an XML parser, and
            you do not get text/html, you get (not-)tag soup. But where in the
            RSS 2.0 spec can you point to, and say: "this prohibits once-encoded
            angle brackets" or "this requires that angle brackets which do not
            surround HTML tags must be re-escaped before being handed to an HTML
            renderer"? I'd never considered the re-escape idea before, but now
            it seems like as reasonable an interpretation of "(entity-encoded
            HTML is allowed)" as the existing interpretation that it means every
            RSS description is text/html as it comes out of the parser.

            At first, I thought the silent data loss argument was a thunderstorm
            in a tea cup. But then I realized that, no matter how small the
            consequences of that problem are, we CAN'T BE TOLERANT to such
            ambiguity in a format like RSS. The simplicity of such a problem
            only shows how badly the format is broken.
            <br />

            <br />
            This is serious business. We're talking a standard that has already
            caused an impact on the web and will take it over entirely in a
            matter of years. Boring as it may be, this discussion is very
            important. There are some things that simply can't be left unsaid.

            When a programmer creates a bug like this it usually affects a

            affects *every* implementation.

            @Phil (the Rignalda one, not the Pearson one ;-) ): actually doubly
            escaping is just the only right way to do it. If you want to put
            brackets or ampersand in, you need to escape them. If you put HTML
            in, you need to escape that. Those two rules are stacked: if you
            want to use brackets or ampersand in HTML, you need to escape them
            anyway and then just escape the full HTML stuff - you get doubly
            escaped chars for your literal ampersands or brackets. I don't
            understand the big rumble they made about this simple fact. Any
            programmer with half a braincell should know this already. But maybe
            it's like frederik guesses and there aren't that much programmers
            with half a braincell in the discussion ;-)
            <br />

            <br />
            Sure, RSS is underspeced. But it's not as if there are no ways to
            find out if what you are doing makes any sense. So if you can't
            figure it out on your own, just check what people will see in some
            aggregators. The Reuters problem would have hit anybody right in the
            face if anybody at Reuters would have cared to test their feed. And
            sorry, but no spec - however complete it's definition might be -
            will safe you from stupidity like this.

            <br />
            Blatantly false. Fixing this exact problem was *the* single most
            important driving factor behind Atom's content model. Atom can
            faithfully describe plain text data that includes angle brackets and
            ampersands.
            <br />

            <br />
            RSS is not simple because you're better at this than we are. RSS is
            simple because it's broken. Even Dave has admitted this now, and
            proposed a solution to RSS's silent data loss problem that looks
            remarkably similar to Atom's content model (except not as elegant).
            <br />

            <br />
            If you fix all the things that are wrong with RSS, and then add all
            the features and ideas that the Atom community has been
            brainstorming with vendors and publishers, then in a few more years,
            you might end up with a format that's half as good as Atom. I say
            "half as good" because it won't really have any coherence; it'll
            just be an even larger pile of desperate and ignorant hacks than it
            is already. It won't have a consistent content model like Atom has
            today. It won't have a consistent linking model like Atom has today.
            And of course it won't be "simple" like RSS is widely mis-regarded
            today... but it might actually not cause silent data loss, so that
            would definitely be a step in the right direction.
            <br />

            <br />
            RSS isn't simple because you're better at this; RSS is simple
            because it's broken.

            Mark, you didn't accurately represent my position, nor do I think
            you're right about whether Atom solved the problem. Further, you're
            going to run into big problems with Atom down the road, and the
            things you're saying now are going to haunt you then, assuming you
            have someone like yourself taking cheap shots at you (I won't be
            that person).

            Anyway, what would you recommend for someone using Atom if they

            I find it humorous that we are trying to talk about silent data
            loss, while struggling w/ an editor that loses data :)

            Preview is a wonderful thing. Phillip?
            <br />

            <br />
            But I have to disagree with Georg that preview solves everything for
            RSS. For the most basic case, single-encoded angle brackets in
            description, it probably mostly does: I can find some things that
            read RSS but don't treat the Reuter's stock symbols as HTML tags,
            but it will take some looking, and it would be pretty obvious that
            they are old and broken in other ways. But once you start looking at
            more elaborate things, and things like treatment of entities in
            title, or HTML in channel/description, you need to have a Windows
            machine, a Mac, and Linux, with dozens of aggregators installed on
            each one, just to find out what you can and can't do. And I need to,
            too. And so does Sam, and Georg, and Randy, and Ian, and everyone
            else who ever wants to do anything other than plain text, just like
            the way we did HTML during the browser wars.
            <br />

            <br />
            The aggregators work just fine? When I first learned about this
            problem, 18 months or so ago, it took me four different aggregators
            to find one that would let me read one of Sam's posts.
            <br />

            <br />
            And while we claim that everybody knows how to deal with RSS 2.0 and
            HTML, what about RSS 0.91? It still exists, and every aggregator
            claims to be able to read it. Do any aggregators at all correctly
            read it, treating a once-encoded less-than as something which should
            display as a literal less-than, not be treated as the start of an
            HTML tag? There is no HTML in RSS 0.91, and the spec makes it clear
            that if you want to say that 1 is less than 2, you encode the
            less-than symbol *once*. Sure, forgiving browsers will usually
            display that, but what about 1 is less than 5 is greater than 4?

            I assume you mean his rss2 feed, where he started using xhtml:body.
            At the time, no aggregator supported this feature and his feed
            didn't work anywhere. Which, I documented for the historians using
            Don Box's blog as the example.

            19 months. Time flew. No, I meant *this* problem: is that
            single-encoded angle-bracket the start of an encoded HTML tag, or is
            this plain text?
