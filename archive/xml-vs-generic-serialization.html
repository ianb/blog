                >wonders about loading XML</a
            >; particularly, he notes a claim that XML serialization and
            deserialization (parsing) is faster than Java's object serialization
            of a DOM, and wonders about Python's serialization (via
            <a href="http://python.org/doc/current/lib/module-pickle.html"
                >pickle</a
            >).
        </p>

        <p>
            If you think about it, it makes sense. First, we're talking about
            serializing an in-language representation of an XML document; you
            can serialize any object to XML (<a
                href="http://gnosis.cx/download/gnosis/xml/pickle/"
                >e.g.</a
            >), but that's bound to be slower than the native serialization,
            since the native serialization (if implemented properly) is more
            compact.
        </p>

        <p>
            But XML isn't hard to parse. It's quite restrictive, and a good XML
            parser that produces a DOM object will mostly do the work it needs
            to do, and no more. And you can't get a lot more compact than the
            XML document, unless you are performing some sort of compression
            (which has performance penalties of its own). If you used generic
            serialization, the disk representation would have to contain all
            sorts of metadata about Node objects and Attribute objects and
            whatnot. Not only is that more data to read through, but generic
            deserialization has to actually pay attention to that information.
        </p>

        <p>
            This was something I played with back when trying to optimize
            <a href="http://blog.colorstudy.com/ianb/weblog/2003/10/26.html#P22"
                >Kata 19</a
            >. In that case, I was reading <tt>/etc/words</tt>, and creating a
            graph based on those. I thought I could save some effort by saving a
            pickle of the graph that I created. But in fact it was dramatically
            slower -- the pickle was much larger, and merely the extra effort of
            reading the file outweighed the effort that went into constructing
            the graph. The graph itself was merely a dictionary; and
            <a href="http://python.org/doc/current/lib/module-marshal.html"
                >marshal</a
            >
            (which is more restrictive than pickle) wasn't significantly better.
        </p>

        <p>
            So, I imagine it can be the same with XML -- either way you have to
            rebuild the objects, and XML is of course well-suited to producing
            an object that represents XML.

            I think Java is more fast than XML serialization, it's just on the
            Windows platform some slow-downs.
