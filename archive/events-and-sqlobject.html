                in lieu of &quot;hooks&quot;... PyCon 2003, I guess. He made a
                <a
                    class="reference"
                    href="http://www.python.org/pycon/2005/papers/29/pycon-2005-events.html"
                    >presentation at PyCon 2005</a
                >
                too, but it didn't resonate in the same way, it just seemed too
                low level; PyDispatcher isn't very complex, but it's a bit
                higher level. I think Jim was really proposing that higher level
                systems be built on the low-level systems, but I dunno... it's
                too abstract then to mean much to me.
            </p>
            <p>
                Anyway, that's what I'm thinking about. The events, at least to
                start, would be at a fairly low level -- covering things like
                creating classes and instances, maybe creates and deletes.
            </p>
            <p>
                One concern I have is that anything can be listening for an
                event, so it's hard to know what all will be effected. When that
                event is raised it's open season, anything could react.
                Especially when there's feedback from the events (which I'm
                planning on) I can imagine confusing ensuing. So... I dunno.
                Logging?

                    A possible solution: use the RuleDispatch package's generic
                    functions for your operations. Define the default method to
                    do whatever the to-be-monitored operation does, and then you
                    get before/after/around methods for free, or you can define
                    custom method combination policies if you like. To
                    subscribe, just register methods on the functions,
                    specifying the target class(es) of parameters. Plus, you can
                    test arbitrary conditions on the parameter values, their
                    attributes, and call arbitrary methods/functions as well to
                    determine whether a method applies. &quot;around&quot;
                    methods and normal methods can choose not to call the
                    &quot;next&quot; method, or to call it with altered
                    parameters or fudge its return value in some way.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The only thing this doesn't do that PyDispatcher does, is
                    that PyDispatcher allows you to remove subscribers, and
                    RuleDispatch doesn't (yet) allow that. RuleDispatch also
                    isn't as efficient if you are subscribing to instances
                    instead of classes. However, if I understand your intended
                    use case, it seems unlikely that you need either of those
                    features for SQLObject, but being able to offer your users
                    an efficient trigger system operating on complex conditions
                    would likely be a big plus. Can you say, &quot;complete
                    business rules system&quot;? :)

                        &quot;&quot;&quot;RuleDispatch also isn't as efficient
                        if you are subscribing to instances instead of
                        classes&quot;&quot;&quot;

                        Actually, I spoke too briefly. RuleDispatch is actually
                        <em>more</em> efficient if you're subscribing to
                        instances, as long as the set of instances involved is
                        relatively static. It's just that if you are adding new
                        instances to subscribe to all the time, then it can cost
                        a lot to keep rebuilding the dispatch tree. However, if
                        you just add a bunch of rules at application startup and
                        then call them, RuleDispatch can be more efficient than
                        PyDispatcher, if the subscribers have overlapping
                        conditional tests taking place. (Because RuleDispatcher
                        evaluates each conditional subexpression at most once,
                        whereas PyDispatcher subscribers can't take advantage of
                        tests evaluated by other subscribers.) This is
                        particularly impactful if any of the tests involve query
                        execution.

                        I had thought about generic functions along the way, but
                        I guess I was too nervous to try them for what seemed
                        like a nominal benefit (over something more conventional
                        like PyDispatcher). There's issues like the fact it
                        introduces C code into a system that has no C code
                        (except, I guess, the database drivers -- but those are
                        commonly packaged). But even more I'm worried that I'd
                        be a drag on an 0.8 release -- as it is, I feel I was a
                        drag on 0.7. So I don't want to introduce new things
                        that I don't entirely understand, unless they are at
                        least limited. So PyDispatcher's more limited rules are
                        an advantage there. Events are also a less complicated
                        concept for other contributors to understand, and since
                        I really want this feature to help open up SQLObject to
                        other developers the comprehensibility is important.

                    <p>
                        If I was going to implement an adaptation system, I
                        would think very seriously about generic functions. In
                        part because conventional adapation systems like Zope
                        Interfaces already use C code. But also because I think
                        adaptation is not easy as it is, and so generic
                        functions aren't such a new and fancy notion. Or, at
                        least, they are no more new and fancy than conventional
                        adaptation -- a concept which has gained little traction
                        outside of Zope 3 (which actually surprises me).
                        TurboGears people are planning to implement a JSON
                        adaptation process... maybe I should suggest something
                        there. Relatedly, there's some good room for
                        adaptation-like processes with FormEncode (and with
                        SQLObject and web framework integration thereof), and
                        that might be an interesting place for experimentation.
                        All the more because I think it's a hard problem that
                        <em>needs</em> new ideas and new programming techniques,
                        so generic functions may very well make it successful
                        where traditional techniques would not. When going down
                        a road strewn with the corpses of previous projects, one
                        must consider why the next project will be different.
                        Forms are a place where exceptions are common, and
                        generic functions are uniquely capable of handling
                        exceptional behavior.

                            if you want. It does make some difference to the
                            performance, sure, but if I recall correctly the
                            difference is measured in a handful of microseconds
                            for most things, mainly because I haven't written a
                            lot of C code for it yet anyway. And for Windows --
                            the main platform where lack of a compiler is
                            usually an issue -- I distribute a binary egg.

                            <li>Subscribing a callback == adding a method</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                            What's so complicated about that? It's true that you
                            have to make some policy decisions about what kinds
                            of subscribers you'll have - i.e.,
                            before/after/around/custom - but once you've made
                            them that's that.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Further, nothing says you have to expose the full
                            power of the system. You can always wrap it in a
                            shortcut API that implements common use cases. Just
                            say that the generic functions are event objects,
                            and have subscribe function(s) that take an event, a
                            callback, and a filter. Voila! It's an event system,
                            and nobody needs to know any part of RuleDispatch
                            that you don't want to expose.
