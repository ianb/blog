                that 'how do I structure my app' is the biggest missing piece of
                most (Python) web frameworks' documentation. The lack is just as
                true for big ones like Zope as it is for all the small players.

                One explanation, at least anecdotal, is that we don't know the
                answer. I started
                <a

                    href="http://cvs.sourceforge.net/viewcvs.py/*checkout*/webware/Webware/WebKit/Docs/ApplicationDevelopment.txt"
                    >such a document</a
                >
                for Webware, but quickly decided the explanation showed off some
                glaring problems in the setup and went off to fix them,
                distracting myself and never finishing the original
                documentation. And really, I only fixed a small portion of the
                code problems while I was at it. I'm sure other
                developer/documenters have the same problem of thinking
                <em>why should I document stupid stuff instead of fixing it</em
                >, then getting distracted.

                When I started doing Zope development for my day job, I felt
                pretty much out in the wilderness as well.
                <a
                    class="reference"

                    >Some documents</a
                >
                told me how I <em>should</em> do things, but all the legacy code
                was so very, very far from that model that I felt somewhat
                abandoned. It's not that the legacy code was bad (well, some of
                it was, but that's inevitable), but that there's a lot of
                <em>really bad</em> advice out there on how to make Zope
                applications. My hint: anything documentation that talks about
                DTML, or starts you out coding in the Zope Management Interface
                (the web interface to Zope) is probably a bad idea to follow.
                Unfortunately that's most of the documentation :(

                Since the Python community (or at least the bloggers) are going
                through a little what's-Rails-got-that-we-don't phase, this is
                another point we can put on that. Rails has strong conventions
                about application layout, and it isn't afraid to tell you about
                it. There's no shy
                <em>well, this is how I do it, but whatever works for you</em>
                stuff -- people usually come in happily willing to accept the
                most draconian and inflexible of standards, because at least it
                gives them a starting point and an opportunity to avoid
                gratuitous differences in code.

                <p>
                    I think that there is a lot to be said for what Rails has to
                    offer. I love Python and use it daily, but have yet to find
                    anything as integrated, easy to use, and clear as Rails. I
                    am not a big Ruby fan (too much like perl after an
                    &quot;extreme makeover&quot;), but have been using Rails to
                    develop some personal web apps because its so much more
                    pleasant than digging through scant documentation, figuring
                    out how to integrate packages, and reconciling all the bits
                    and pieces available for Python.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I actually think the Rails approach is the best way (and
                    more Pythonic than Python web frameworks in a way), rather
                    than the approach that both Python and Java use. In Python
                    and Java, there are tons of packages available for doing
                    templating, persistence, controllers, etc. These packages
                    are written by different people, with different terminology,
                    and different styles. Sure, its more &quot;flexible&quot;
                    but its a lot less convenient. With Rails there is only one
                    way, and what's more Pythonic than that? Isn't Python
                    supposed to be the &quot;there's only one way to do it&quot;
                    language! This is why I love Python more as a language than
                    Ruby, but Rails really got it right in terms of framework.
                    When it comes to frameworks, consistency, simplicity, and
                    integration are the most important things! Why don't people
                    understand that?
                </p>
                <p>
                    Python bloggers have been talking a lot about how we can do
                    all the things Rails does in Python using WebWare, CherryPy,
                    Quixote, Kid, PSP, mod_python, SqlObject, PyDO, Zope, Plone,
                    etc, etc, etc... but THATS NOT THE POINT! You can do all the
                    Rails things (well, many of them) in Java too... but the
                    problem is that its a pain in the ass. Granted, its less of
                    a pain in the ass in Python than in Java, but still not
                    nearly as pleasant and integrated as in Rails.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Rails makes writing web apps fun again. I can't say that for
                    any of the combinations (permutations?) of Python packages
                    available. And, no, I don't think that the
                    &quot;Subway&quot; approach is right... it would be wiser to
                    start from scratch to get the best integration, or at least
                    fork the &quot;starting point&quot; packages (CherryPy, etc)
                    so that you can make things more consistent and tightly
                    integrated from the get-go.

                        Has anyone done any study into what exactly is so
                        tightly integrated that a platform can't just piece
                        existing components together using Adapters and similar
                        approaches?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Building the ORM scaffold stuff doesn't seem to require
                        rewriting anything from scratch. If you build the table
                        first, then SQLObject can keep the fields in order (the
                        only irritation I have when using SQLObject to create
                        the tables), and the platform can use Adapters to build
                        a FunFormKit-based system to edit/create the objects,
                        and simple list/view things too. In other words, the
                        developer only need do what the Rails developer does:
                        create a model and a controller. The rest magically
                        springs to life.

                        What _does_ require stronger integration, especially to
                        the point of rewriting the existing components?

                            In part integration saves you a lot of little jobs.
                            But later the integration might not be a big win, as
                            your particular application goes further from the
                            assumptions the integration makes. <em>But</em>,
                            that still leaves you with a base to start with, and
                            a convention -- if the integration serves no purpose
                            except to codify application layout and object
                            composition, that's still a valuable thing.

                            Hmm... I've noticed the column ordering problem in
                            SQLObject as well. It would be good to keep track of
                            the chronological order in which the
                            <tt class="literal"
                                ><span class="pre">Col</span></tt
                            >
                            objects were created, then sort on that. That should
                            give the ordering you want.

                            As far as adapters, that's certainly how they are
                            intended to be used. I've had mixed results using
                            them; I might just be using them incorrectly, but I
                            might again blame it on a lack of codifying best
                            practices ;)

                    them, that should be it. I want to spend more time thinking
                    about <em>what</em> do I want in my database, what
                    interesting things do I want to with my data and show to the
                    world, than <em>how</em> I'm going to go about the tedious
                    mechanics of shovelling it into and out of an RDBMS and a
                    web server.

                        &gt; ... not to mention an opportunity to avoid wasting
                        time reinventing tedious and trivial wheels when they
                        could instead be devoting effort to thinking about how
                        their application could do things that are interesting
                        (and/or that somebody might actually want to pay for)
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        That is supposed to be the benefit for any 'framework',
                        and for successful ones with actual users ( sqrt(n) &gt;
                        # of framework developers) it works to some extent. The
                        diversity of approaches to building web applications
                        that is so visible in the python world may be due to the
                        ease with which ideas can be dressed out in python, and
                        the social incentives for being a framework developer.
                        Other languages have the same diversity of approach but
                        don't see it as being as much of a problem.

                        I wonder if the 'web applications are engineering
                        projects' metaphor is a good map for the problem space.
                        There may be others that would give us better mental
                        tools for dealing with different classes of projects,
                        perhaps 'web application styles are like literary
                        forms'; we all know the difference between a short
                        story, a sonnet and a sales pitch, and what situations
                        each is appropriate for, and that some forms are more
                        structured than others, and can make better use of
                        predefined components.
