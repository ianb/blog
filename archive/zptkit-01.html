                has released; there's a certain challenge to getting something
                out there, since it is true that this doesn't offer any
                immediate benefit to the company. Though at the same time this
                sort of infrastructure (since this is just a library, it doesn't
                <em>do</em> anything) is the kind of thing where open source
                benefits require the least investment -- by both using open
                tools and building open tools, it gets us to produce a solid
                foundation of software. And that <em>is</em> very beneficial,
                without any question -- all the difficulty in open sourcing
                something is almost completely in polishing the software so it's
                fit for external consumption. But in many ways it is to an
                organization's disadvantage to build things that are obscure and
                require undocumented knowledge. So it's good process.

                has been using the library internally for maybe six months -- as
                soon as we developed applications in Webware (before we just
                used Zope), I wanted to keep some common technology, and ZPT was
                a good candidate -- it's already
                <a class="reference" href="http://zpt.sf.net"
                    >packaged separately</a
                >, it's a part of the system (templates) that gets exposed to
                lots of people in the organization, and it's just a good
                templating system. A little verbose at times, but it always lets
                me do what I need to do, which is far more important.

                I've been very happy with out it has worked, and how it both
                fits into the structure of the applications, and helps direct
                that structure. It encourages model-view-controller design
                without being heavy-handed or even explicit about it; it's just
                the natural way applications evolve when the tools are there. I
                hope to work out a basic framework of a Webware application,
                that is less free-form than the standard examples (along the
                lines of
                <a class="reference" href="tell-me-what-to-do-please.html"
                    >tell me what to do</a
                >); but that's something we're still working out internally,
                even if we've gotten closer.

                on Monday and Tuesday; I'll be in DC on Saturday and Sunday, but
                I thought I'd actually see a little of the city this year, and
                <a class="reference" href="http://potteryblog.com">Emily</a>
                will also be there (she's in Baltimore right now attending the
