            Interesting factoid: Zope 3 (last time I heard) won't reload your
            files for you, you have to restart the server. Presumably manually.
            Unfortunately, the Zope server can't be restarted anywhere close to
            fast enough to make Webware's technique work (Webware starts fast
            enough that it can restart on a whim, like when any file is edited).
            Jim Fulton seemed uncomfortable with Zope 2's product reloading,
            mostly because of these evil stale code issues that come up
            occassionally.

            Zope 2's "product reloading" is optional, conditioned on a flag that
            you put in a file within your product. I never use it, just because
            it's easy enough to press "ctrl-C, up-arrow, enter" on the console I
            use to run Zope (and it only takes about 10 seconds or so for it to
            restart). You get used to it. I won't miss it in Zope 3.

            I add the usual comment: in Common Lisp or Smalltalk based web apps
            you
            <br />
            can do live updates that immediately update all current instances,
            including
            <br />
            nifty update schemes to old instances if necessary. If your Zope
            server restarts
            <br />
            in ten seconds consider yourself lucky, on a large site with many
            products and
            <br />
            lots of content it takes a bit more. I'd rather have live updates
            without any
            <br />
            delay. It enables a more explorative style of development. Even a
            small delay
            <br />
            like ten seconds is painful in interactive work -- imagine if the
            Python CLI
            <br />
            took a ten second for each expression...

            Smalltalk has an easier time of it because it doesn't have to keep
            source in a file in sync with code in the process. Non-product
            (through-the-web) Zope development, where code is kept in the ZODB
            (similar to the Smalltalk image) doesn't have this syncing problem.
            I've never had problems with stale code in that environment. OTOH,
            that environment sucks for all sorts of other reasons, and Smalltalk
            isn't immune to those same issues. (All the past criticisms of
            Smalltalk I wrote in
            <a
                href="http://blog.colorstudy.com/ianb/weblog/2004/03/10.html#P68"

            apply quite well to Zope in this respect)
            <br />

            <br />
            However, I certainly concede that it's a compromise -- there are
            real advantages to the way Smalltalk does it. (Frankly, the Zope
            through-the-web environment isn't mature enough to stand up nearly
            as well to these criticisms.) But those advantages are closely tied
            to some disadvantages. (Well, if Python modules and classes were
            more declarative and less imperative, it would be possible to do
            these updates a bit more elegantly -- but that itself is a
            compromise, as there's some added flexibility in Python because of
            the concreteness of its objects.)

            Nils: I think the problem with your Zope restarts might be that you
            don't use ZEO. With ZEO, restarts are quite fast as the database
            index never needs be rebuilt (unless you stop the ZEO server in an
            unorderly fashion). The number of products doesn't really impact
            things significantly (unless you have an ill-behaved product, that
            is).
            <br />

            <br />
            In any case, needing to restart the process that rusn my code really
            doesn't bother me very much (Zope or non-Zope), as long as it takes
            under, say, 10 seconds. The only time I really want to see changes
            immediately is for presentation/HTML code, which, in Zope, CMF skins
            allow me to do, and for CGI/mod_*, obviously just happens anyway
            (with extreme penalties and with some caveats).

                        Chris: the site I was talking about uses ZEO. It is just
                        very large with lots of render clients. It's also not a
                        good fit for Zope because Zope wasn't designed for
                        building a distributed transaction platform. And the
                        folks who wrote the original code were worse developers
                        than monkeys on crack.
