        <h1>RESTful transactions (a speculation)</h1>

        <div class="document">
            <p>
                So I've been doing some work on
                <a class="reference" href="http://pythonpaste.org/ohm/">OHM</a>,
                which is a library for exposing an object as a series of RESTful
                resources. (It also is a library for consuming such services,
                but for now don't use that because it's still twitchy -- but the
                server-side half is good IMHO.)
            </p>
            <p>
                I realized part way through that it was different from many such
                APIs that I've seen, in that OHM exposes <em>attributes</em> as
                resources, not entire documents. This made sense for the thing I
                was initially creating, as it's basically the configuration API
                for the entire application, and since the application is farmed
                (that is, we add new instances programmatically) I wanted to
                deal with a bunch of these objects in a general way. I could
                have done it with normal controllers and standard framework
                stuff, but resources actually map really great to attributes
                (GET is getattr, PUT is setattr, DELETE is delattr) so it was a
                very comfortable fit. Also while I could represent the entire
                configuration as one XML document, I didn't really
                <em>want</em> to do that as the document would feel very
                artificial to me.
            </p>
            <p>
                The downside of exposing a bunch of resources is that, while
                it's easy to set them each individually, there's no way to
                indicate that you want to do a bunch of things at once. There's
                no <em>transactions</em> -- you can update 2 out of 4 things,
                then fail, and there's no good way to revert. You can reset
                everything, which <em>should</em> work -- if you are using
                symmetric methods like GET and PUT, by putting back what you got
                before you should be safe. There still might be side effects --
                things like logs, last changed timestamps, etc -- but if you are
                being properly RESTful then there shouldn't be any
                <em>important</em> side effects. That would be possible for me
                to do here, as it's not likely there will be much concurrency.
                But that's not a very good transaction.
            </p>
            <p>
                There's another option I've been thinking about: pack a bunch of
                requests into one request. MIME already defines a way to do this
                sort of thing:
            </p>

                Generally this doesn't make a lot of sense for GET requests, and
                so the Multi-Status responses are generally a little boring in
                the case of a success (they should all be some form of 2xx). But
                for failures it is more interesting:

                WebDAV uses XML responses for 207, but it's not a very good
                match for what HTTP already is IMHO -- HTTP looks like MIME, it
                doesn't look anything like XML.
            </p>
            <p>
                Of course all this is purely speculative; nothing implements any
                of this. But I started thinking about this in terms of a WSGI
                middleware that explodes out the requests, turning that example
                into two WSGI requests. <em>If</em> all the pieces can agree on
                a container for the transaction (so the side-effects of the
                requests can be committed or rolled back as one), then it could
                almost be automatic -- you just make sure all the requests share
                the same transaction. This doesn't work over process boundaries
                really, though with a two-phase commit and some convention for
                indicating the transaction, it should be doable. Maybe like:
            </p>
            <pre class="literal-block">
POST /resource HTTP/1.1
X-Transaction-ID: 12345 (globally unique non-guessable ID)
...

HTTP/1.1 202 Accepted
Content-Type: ...

(response body AS IF the commit had happened)

POST /resource HTTP/1.1
X-Transaction-ID: 12345
X-Commit: true

HTTP/1.1 204 No Content
</pre
            >
            <p>
                Two-phase commit is hardly a great solution, or necessarily easy
                to implement generally, but at least this offers
                <em>some</em> possible practice for doing this.
            </p>
            <p>
                Interestingly (at least to me), you <em>can</em> build tools to
                implement this sort of convention in different environments. To
                ensure interoperability you'd need some kind of document or
                <em>something</em> to define what was expected. In the REST vs.
                WS-* conflict it often seems phrased as though it's purely
                use-what-we-have vs. build-new-specifications. Or
                use-what-we-have and build-new-frameworks. There's an underlying
                (and incorrect) assumption that if you subscribe to REST notions
                then <em>what we have is all we will have</em>. I think it's
                more that REST people want to walk lightly when building on web
                that we have; avoid recreating what already exists, and
                definitely don't conflict with it. There's a deeper
                architectural difference as well -- WS-* is focused on RPC, and
                the over-the-wire protocols defer to the language frameworks,
                while REST is focused on independent resources and pushes back
                on language frameworks to fit that model. But that distinction
                doesn't mean there isn't new code to be written, and new
                conventions or specifications to be built.

                        Generally REST is better optimized for reads than writes
                        anyway. In the particular situation I'm in neither
                        performance is terribly important -- it's just a
                        configuration API, not part of the regular
                        functionality. 4 GETs <em>could</em> be optimized just
                        with Keep-Alive, assuming going up and down the backend
                        stack is fast enough. It depends on the application of
                        course, but multiple requests aren't necessarily a
                        problem. And really while I stuffed a bunch of
                        configuration in <em>one</em> piece of code (WSGI
                        middleware actually), it's really covering about 3
                        different use cases, and potentially all of those could
                        be handled separately, and then it
                        <em>really</em> should be multiple requests. (Unless I
                        automatically aggregate them somehow, which is what I'm
                        considering here.)

                        Sure, you could do it that way, though each of those
                        attributes is at least moderately complicated (generally
                        each is a JSON document). It's not that different from
                        what I propose, actually, except what I discuss can be
                        understood by an intermediary. Well... actually I can't

                    You could look into the locking section in the WebDAV
                    specification:

                <p>
                    Of course, you'd still need to implement your own
                    transactional mechanisms. Meanwhile, there's also the
                    versioning extensions to WebDAV, which seem to exist to
                    support Subversion, or at least things similar to
                    Subversion:

                <p>
                    The problem with the WebDAV specifications is that to be
                    compliant you end up having to support lots of stuff you'll
                    rarely need, I suppose.

                    Though for me, the issue is less one of transactions than
                    optimization. The backend (PyLucene) performs
                    <em>much</em> better when passed requests in batches. So a
                    request like (pardon the pseudocode):
                </p>
                <p>PUTMANY(doc1, doc2, doc3, doc4)</p>
                <p>is much zippier than doing:</p>
                <dl class="docutils">
                    <dt>for d in [doc1, doc2, doc3, doc4]:</dt>
                    <dd>PUT(d)</dd>
                </dl>
                <p>interestingly, this is true for GET as well...</p>

                        Doing this in an intermediary wouldn't really help then,
                        as it would make the controller unaware of the other
                        requests happening at the same time. Hmm... too bad
                        that. Though in that case you wouldn't have to use a
                        standard intermediary like I propose, you could have a
                        custom one, and presumably client-side support can
                        develop separately without having to pay attention to it
                        one way or the other.

                <p>
                    I've been thinking about this issue as well for a project
                    I've been tinkering with, a RESTful database implemented in
                    Python [1].
                </p>
                <p>
                    One idea I had was to add a special transaction resource (at
                    /transactions, or some other agreed-upon location). When you
                    POST to the transaction resource, it sprouts a new child
                    with a unique ID (/transactions/12345). That URL now
                    duplicates the entire structure of the database. So if the
                    database had a resource called /Users/Bob, there is now a
                    /transactions/12345/Users/Bob resource. The client can do
                    all of his database operations within his transaction
                    sandbox, then POST to /transactions/12345 to commit.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I think this is a fairly RESTful way to implement
                    transactions. The best part IMO is that it allows you to add
                    transactions without adding any HTTP headers, additional
                    verbs, etc. The only downside I see is that there are now
                    multiple URLs for a single resource. You might be able to
                    solve that by using HTTP 301 to point clients at the
                    canonical one if they try to touch something that's already
                    been committed.

                            Yes, I posted my reply here before reading through
                            that thread. :) It seems like the only real
                            difference between our approaches is that when you
                            create a transaction, you tell it which resources
                            you'll want to touch. I prefer to &quot;branch&quot;
                            the whole URL space, rather than some subset. That
                            way, your code doesn't have to think about which
                            resources it'll touch until it does the touching. :)

                    Yikes. I propose two reasons you'd rather head down a
                    different path.

                        I expect that usually when you want to update several
                        things at once, you're doing something singularly
                        nameable; ie, there's a further abstraction to the group
                        of work that is a resource. In OHM I see this issue,
                        each attribute is individually accessible, but although
                        we've grouped them into an object's attributes
                        conceptually, there's no way to access or offer that
                        conceptual grouping. OHM-level support for record and
                        collection (tuple and relation :) abstractions should be
                        implemented, even if it's just a set of conventions that
                        we don't know yet. If we can name the set of data we're
                        updating (at the simplest level, SO's o.set vs
                        o._set_X), we can REST it in one request. The
                        abstraction part comes from seeing your data as a
                        relational database with idealized views.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        We still have to make use of mechanisms where it is each
                        resource's responsibility to ensure its state transition
                        is atomic when reacting to a side-effect verb, because
                        any abstraction over URL-based referencing means process
                        boundary is no different from server boundary or network
                        boundary. How do you architect this differently when
                        your mindset is thinking about having a change on this
                        site need to set something else on another site? Same as
                        within parts of your site that you may end up
                        partitioning by machine or farm out to a third party.
                        Rhetorically, does the reliability of that inner
                        resource impact the assumptions of the original code
                        when you could count on a local transaction? If updating
                        your marriage status should be reflected in your holy
                        rewards program availability, is two-phase commit with
                        an optimization if we're lucky enough to be on the same
                        process really the mechanism that comes to mind? Mines a
                        little blurry.

                        I expect that usually when you want to update several
                        things at once, you're doing something singularly
                        nameable; ie, there's a further abstraction to the group
                        of work that is a resource. In OHM I see this issue,
                        each attribute is individually accessible, but although
                        we've grouped them into an object's attributes
                        conceptually, there's no way to access or offer that
                        conceptual grouping.

                    <p>
                        If you do want to do this in OHM, you can create an
                        attribute that is located at the root of the object (<tt
                            class="docutils literal"
                            ><span class="pre">url_path=&quot;&quot;</span></tt
                        >). This can be a property that aggregates all the
                        attributes of the object. <em>If</em> they are all JSON,
                        you could do:
                    </p>
                    <pre class="literal-block">
class MyObject(object):
    ... all the other attrs ...
    all_attrs = ['a', 'b', ...]
    def complete_state__get(self):
        return dict((attr, getattr(self, attr))
                    for attr in self.all_attrs)
    def complete_state__set(self, data):
        for name, value in data.items():
            assert name in self.all_attrs
            setattr(self, name, value)
    complete_state = property(complete_state__get, complete_state__set)

class MyObjectWrapper(ohm.server.ApplicationWrapper):
    complete_state = ohm.server.JSONSetter(uri_path='')

                        With XML you could do something similar, though actually
                        creating the documents involves more documentation and
                        details. But if you have heterogeneous types in your
                        resources this doesn't work so well. For instance, I
                        also attach a file server to the object that accepts
                        PUT, MKCOL, and DELETE. Or some objects may be JSON, and
                        others XML documents, and some operations might really
                        be POST operations, and so forth. Mixing these into one
                        document just doesn't work.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        So what I describe here is really the same process, only
                        it's amenable to any kind of document types. And I
                        suppose eclectic HTTP methods.

                        We still have to make use of mechanisms where it is each
                        resource's responsibility to ensure its state transition
                        is atomic when reacting to a side-effect verb, because
                        any abstraction over URL-based referencing means process
                        boundary is no different from server boundary or network
                        boundary. How do you architect this differently when
                        your mindset is thinking about having a change on this
                        site need to set something else on another site?

                        I certainly would not argue that this lets you ignore
                        what's going on, internally or in the remote server. The
                        failure cases and likelihood of those cases will change.
                        This is really just a tool to make the
                        <em>mechanics</em> easier. That doesn't make the system
                        design easier, except that it might let you focus on the
                        system and not get too bogged down in the mechanics.

                    I'm new to this - so forgive me if this is a silly
                    suggestion;
                </p>
                <p>
                    Instead of a PUT just to update the existing config
                    attributes, can you also use PUT to create a new config set?
                </p>
                <p>
                    Then use a PUT to make that the new config current ( a
                    'committ')
                </p>
                <p>
                    Maybe define a GET to retrieve past, current, and new config
                    sets that have been PUT? (So you can rollback to one of
                    them)
                </p>
