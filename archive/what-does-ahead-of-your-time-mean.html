            </blockquote>
            <p>
                After thirty years, what does it meant to be ahead of your time?
                There was a little meme going around that I can't remember well
                enough to find again -- when you explain something and the other
                person doesn't understand, it's not their problem, it's yours.
            </p>
            <p>
                That's not entirely fair -- Smalltalk has informed and
                influenced the computing world a great deal. But it's still
                worth thinking about. Or to paraphrase myself, as lame as
                self-quoting is: saying that Smalltalk has achieved every
                success it deserves would be to damn with faint praise.
            </p>
            <p>
                Maybe more Smalltalk users should offer opinions on the flaws of
                the language, since they don't want to hear my opinion. If they
                think it is without flaws then they lack both imagination and
                ambition, because there is always more to be done.

            For example, the Squeak developers mailing-list is bursting with

            I read your original article, your followup, and all the comments
            and trackbacks on each. My take on it is that the Smalltalk users
            who commented didn't think Smalltalk was without flaws; they just
            thought you didn't know what you were talking about, and that the
            things you thought were flaws were either not present or virtues. In
            short, they did want to hear what you had to say, and they heard it,
            but what you had to say was almost entirely wrong.
            <br />

            <br />
            In their opinions. I don't know enough about Smalltalk to comment.

            (I know I shouldn't keep up with these threads, it's mostly
            distracting not helpful, but I can't help myself, and
            meta-discussion is stupid, yet I can't help myself)
            <br />

            <br />
            In response to Kragen, others: My posts were based on the premise
            there was something wrong with Smalltalk. Because it was a premise,
            not the real content of my post, I think people who didn't agree
            with the premise found it difficult to respond (for no fault of
            their own), the best you can do in such a situation is say
            "Smalltalk is great!" which isn't a very satisfying response for
            either side. But then I wasn't really willing to turn this into a
            multi-part tretise where I outline my points from basic principles,
            so I must expect people to infer what my premises are and come up
            with their own conclusions.
            <br />

            <br />
            Anyway, after we get past that issue, there's the strawman issue. My
            original post was imprecise in language (my fault), and was
            misinterpreted in a number of ways. People criticised these
            misinterpretations, e.g., that you could not easily use foreign
            functions in Smalltalk, when I intended to refer to the conceptual
            difficulty when Smalltalk and foreign interfaces are not isomorphic.
            They plucked a few of these misunderstandings out and then declared
            that I knew nothing about Smalltalk. Which I found very frustrating.
            Still do, I suppose, otherwise I wouldn't be commenting here.
            <br />

            <br />
            Ultimately, I guess I was looking for a retort I didn't get -- a
            "no, Smalltalk's problem isn't what you said, the problem is X". I
            suppose it's rather too optimistic to think I'd get that kind of
            response. It requires a thoughtful response, and requires that the
            reader attempts to understand my perspective and frame the response
            in those terms -- and I recognize that it takes a great deal of
            effort to create that kind of response, and the people who responded
            didn't necessarily have any investment in my opinion, so they
            weren't inclined to invest in that kind of response. Well, there
            were some long responses (Georg wrote whole essays) -- I'm not sure
            what it means that I'm not satisfied with those either. Maybe I am
            just stubborn.
            <br />

            <br />
            But frankly, I do go out of my way to respond in thoughtful ways
            taking into account the perspective of my audience, so I'm not
            asking for something I'm not myself willing to give. (Which is why I
            appreciate the difficulty of composing that kind of response)

            You shouldn't start language arguments if you don't want to get
            essays from me ;-)
            <br />

            <br />
            I think the main point why you didn't get a "Smalltalks flaws isn't
            X, it's Y". Smalltalk isn't that flawed in large scale. Sure, there
            are some smaller problems in the language itself (for example the
            missing operator precedence - but then, you get used to that, in the
            same way you get used to significant whitespace in Python or big
            loads of braces in Perl). It's quite a complete language whose
            implementations usually carray around quite a complete environment
            with most tools a programmer will need. They have some centuries of
            experience in building development environments, not like the
            make-compile-link-debug-segfault programmers with their centuries of
            not-development-environments ;-)
            <br />

            <br />
            The reason why Smalltalk didn't take off in larger scale? Timing.
            Marketing. Mostly the same reasons as there are for the acceptance
            problems of Lisp. Ok, one special Lisp problem is missing: the
            "teached-to-death" symptom. Don't know how many people got driven
            away from Lisp or Scheme just because stupid courses at their
            university. :-(
            <br />

            <br />
            Smalltalk had it's high time in the 90s. Then came Java and people
            jumped that language after failing with C++. Had there been better
            marketing for Smalltalk, I am sure that it would have taken over
            then. But the market wasn't reacting to the opportunities. There was
            a very interesting discussion in the Smalltalk panel at OOP in 98 or
            so - when the guy who wrote Smalltalk/X talked to the panel and
            explicitely accused them (the panel was boarded with people from the
            Smalltalk companies and from Universities) of making Smalltalk bad
            with their way to do stuff, especially with their
            closed-shop-mentality. Not enough public visibility. Cincom does the
            right thing: giving their environment away for free (as in beer) to
            allow programmers to play with it. Back then there were only very
            few freely available Smalltalk versions around: Smalltalk/X (a
            commandline compiler for Smalltalk to C), Squeak (in a much simpler
            version than today) and GNU Smalltalk (commandline interpreter). The
            rest (Tiny Smalltalk and lot's of other projects) were mostly toy
            implementations or specialized university projects. Yes, I know,
            Self was already there, but Self is it's own category, even if it
            shares a lot with Smalltalk.
            <br />

            <br />
            So I think it's not the language fault that it didn't take off in
            larger scale. It's mostly a problem of people. As allways ...

            <br />
            Hah, I got you to say it! ;) That was exactly my point! Or, my
            counter-point, or the point which was central to my underlying
            accusation. It's not the problem of people. "When you’re explaining
            something to somebody and they don’t get it, that’s not their
            problem, it’s your problem." If Smalltalk has a message and an idea
            that people aren't getting, it's not the people's problem, it's
            Smalltalk's problem (in a practical as well as philosophical sense).
            That's the flaw, and the premise, that I have been trying to explore
            all along.

            Sorry, but that's plain wrong. "If they don't get it, the
            explanation is wrong" is already a stupid sentence (it's misused as
            an excuse for lazy and sloppy people far too often), but at least
            right to some degree - wrong teaching can do a lot of wrong for
            language learning. Think of the silly way Latin usually is teached -
            without actually speaking it, giving the reason that it's a dead
            language and so no need to speak it - but that way people often
            don't "get it", because like me they _think_ in the language they
            are using and a language without talking blocks this way to use it.
            But "they don't get it, so the tool is at fault" is just plain silly
            - it's not Smalltalks fault as a language or environment that people
            don't teach it right.
            <br />

            <br />
            Programming language knowledge doesn't fall out of trees. It's an
            art that you need to master - and there is a lot of work to be done
            before one can decide wether a language is the right or the wrong
            tool for the job. For me there were several languages I used quite a
            lot where I early on decided that they are not the right tools for
            me. Mostly had to do with aesthetics. So I don't object to people
            saying that some language wasn't done for them. But saying a
            language failed because people don't "get it" is silly. People
            failed. Either by teaching it or by learning it. Languages are
            tools, tools don't fail. Oh, and tools don't have a message. They
            are tools. They might not be the right tool for the job - but if you
            say "language X isn't the right tool for job Y" be prepared for
            several other programmers popping up and saying the opposite. Just
            because they are solving exactly your problem in exactly the
            language you said wasn't fit for the job. People told me that Python
            as an interpreted language isn't fit for distributed file system
            programming. I objected and wrote one. There are TCP/IP stacks out
            there written in pure Lisp. People write games using Lisp - and I am
            not talking about oldfashioned stuff here! There are distributed
            systems written in Smalltalk. Telecom switches programmed in Lisp or
            some in Erlang (mix of functional and declarative programming
            language - two paradigms where people are fast to tell you that they
            are not usefull for real world problems). I've seen device drivers
            written in Smalltalk - if the system is designed for Smalltalk,
            that's not uncommon.
            <br />

            <br />
            I've heard this "language X is at fault" about far too many
            languages before. Smalltalk. Comon Lisp. Scheme. Haskell. Clean. ML
            in it's manyfold variations. Prolog. Weird enough, if you do dig a
            bit through google, you will find many success stories for those
            languages and for real world problems. Ok, Haskell is a bit
            handicapped there - it is the only language where even I failed in
            "getting it". I don't blame the language, though, but much more my
            deficits in knowledge about the needed abstractions.
            <br />

            <br />
            So in my experience people only pull the "if they don't get it, it's
            wrong" card when they themselves didn't "get it". And try to explain
            that fact by the inapproprietness of the tool instead looking for
            the real reasons. The fact that you allways hammer your thumb
            instead of the nail isn't an indication that the tool named "hammer"
            failed. It's just an indication of your manual imperfectness :-)

            If you just want to make something that's cool, maybe you can blame
            the person who doesn't get it. But if you want to change the world
            (even in a little way), then you have to blame yourself when the
            other person doesn't get it, since it's your ambition that then
            fails, not their. Smalltalk's dream has always been to change the
            world.

            But Smalltalk doesn't have a dream. It's a language. So what dream
            did fail? Adele Goldbergs dream to build tools that help children to
            learn programming? That's a success, she is using them and kids are
            learning programming with Smalltalk based tools - Squeak carries
            some of those tools. Alan Kays dream to build the integration
            language of a graphical workstation? That was a success, the machine
            was built, it ran and worked. His dream of building a full blown
            tool for teaching programming and testing implementations in a
            extensive environment? Look at Squeak. A big success for the field
            it's built for - you can even try different VM implementations based
            on Smalltalk code. The dream of the Parkplace founders to get a
            development environment that spans several platforms and operating
            systems? Was a success, see the result in the current version of
            Cincom Smalltalk. Ok, it wasn't a success for the company itself, at
            least not in the long run - but then, most companies sooner or later
            drop out of business. The business model for Parkplace failed, but
            their tools are still working and are still used - is that failure
            for you?
            <br />

            <br />
            Smalltalk _did_ change the world. It spawned whole languages like
            Objective-C that are nowadays used to implement an operating system
            that powers 5% of the personal computers in use. It influenced
            graphical environments more than most other system. It influenced
            development tools in many ways - hierarchical class browsers, the
            Python module path browser, many tools are modeled after what was
            already there in the original Smalltalk systems (and wasn't there
            before in this particular way - some Lisp machines did have similar
            tools, but they were still quite different from the much simpler
            view Smalltalk presented). So in what way did Smalltalk actually
            fail? There are not really that many languages and environments that
            changed so much in the world of software development as Smalltalk
            did. Generational garbage collection - first implemented in Lisp
            systems and Smalltalk systems. Virtual machine with defined bytecode
            - first done for Smalltalk. Hotspot optimization technology
            (dynamically compiling bytecode to machine code) - first done in
            Smalltalk systems. Full blown object oriented systems with extensive
            class libraries - first done with Smalltalk (Simula was the first
            implementation of OO, but the class library was rather small and
            more targeted at simulation software, Lisps Flavors and Loops were
            early OO systems, but no class libraries, as they were used to
            implement AI software). Sorry, but how can you talk about
            "Smalltalks dream to change the world" and say it was a failure?
            <br />

            <br />
            Oh, and building things that should last _is_ about building cool
            things. Only cool things stay around, as people love to play with
            cool things. Build cool things and you _will_ change the world. Even
            those boring things that dominate some field usually started as cool
            - Java _was_ cool when it started it's life as just the JVM with the
            Java language. It became boring by SUN trying to dominate the
            software world and adding warts like J2EE instead of coolness.
            <br />

            <br />
            Don't know how cool it was when Admiral Grace Hopper implemented the
            first Cobol compiler, though ...

            Ok, ok, your right, I shouldn't underestimate the influence and
            importance of Smalltalk. And dominance shouldn't be confused with
            success. At least when you're considering actors that are not
            motivated purely by commerce -- Java would be a failure if it was
            super cool, but not a commercial success, because for a public
            company commercial success is the only success there is. But the
            people behind Smalltalk have never seemed primarily motivated by
            that.
            <br />

            <br />
            Smalltalk hasn't and probably won't achieve dominance, but that's
            okay.

            Main problems with Smalltalk: it's not popular. Popularity results
            not so much from the quality of the product or idea, but from
            history and marketing. Marketing Visual Basic [the MOST successful
            language in terms of $$$] was done by a company with a big
            guaranteed revenue stream run a by a shrewed money-making management
            team.
            <br />

            <br />
            Smalltalk was invented at Xerox in the early 1980's, but Xerox had
            no idea what to do with it commercially -- Xerox didn't market it or
            use it very much -- and then a few years later Xerox was being
            clobbered by Japanese copier companies and didn't have the money to
            market the hell out of development platform.
            <br />

            <br />
            Consider what could have happened if PARC had been a Microsoft
            research facility -- if Bill Gates had commercialized Smalltalk
            instead of Visual Basic.
            <br />

            <br />
            As to the other big development at PARC - windowing / easy to use
            interfaces - Apple took that idea and commercialized it, and then
            Microsoft copied Apple. Note that when Steve Jobs founded NEXT, Inc.
            he copied not only the idea of windowing interfaces, but also the
            idea of an OO application framework, having learned to look beyond
            the surface. NextStep [and now Apple's Cocoa] uses Objective C --
            And Objective C is C with Smalltalk-like OO extensions.
            <br />

            <br />
            If I remember right, Xerox Parc also developed ethernet (but didn't
            make money at it) and the predecessor of PostScript (but didn't make
            money at that).
