                of articles on JVM languages) and he had a few
                criticisms/suggestions of Python. I've mentioned some minor
                things that annoy me before, but this made me want to collect
                them all, and list all the things I wish Python did. Python 3K

                even Python 3K. (Note: implementation of Python 4K is left an an
                exercise for the reader.)

                This isn't all backward compatible, but that said I'm not
                inclined to suggest needless backward incompatibilities either.
                Some people seem allergic to any &quot;bloat&quot; in a
                language, and obsess over removing things from
                <tt class="docutils literal"
                    ><span class="pre">builtins</span></tt
                >
                and elsewhere. I find this silly. Some people need to learn how
                to ignore what they don't care about.

                        <em>regularly</em> have bugs because of this -- mostly

                        But class <em>variables</em> should stay visible through

                        This means that:

                    <pre class="literal-block">

                        but it feels very hacky, and

                        has to be designed for it. Something more conservative
                        might also be just fine. It annoys me that attributes
                        are unordered through these techniques. But maybe not
                        worth fixing.

                        compatibility problems, but certain people aren't
                        willing to admit it, and instead just call the issues
                        &quot;bugs&quot;. Yeah, there's more bugs than non-bugs
                        in the <em>standard library</em>, so I'm unimpressed.

                        do anything environment-dependent on startup (modules
                        could opt in or opt out or something with respect to

                        One thing I noticed from some recent Ruby criticisms
                        I've read is that its syntax errors can be hard to read
                        -- and then I realized this is in part because you have
                        to wait until the end of the file for the compiler to
                        catch some syntax errors that a Python can catch
                        immediately because of whitespace.

                        event-based programming, and continuations (used in that

                        are the web. Continuations are people who want to make
                        the web into an MVC GUI. GUIs are so twentieth century.

                        other things in terms of them doesn't impress me either;
                        I'm also pretty comfortable with a series of specific

                        <em>macros</em> don't really interest me (in a general
                        sense) as I think they work on the wrong level -- they
                        deal with syntax transformations, as opposed to
                        object-level transformations. A fairly conservative set
                        of additions to the syntax (I note queries and the
                        interface/etc extension above) are better than macros.

                        was fixed, because people only complain about method
                        bodies because think it adds weight to their argument
                        against signatures (even though I think the opposite is

                Well, that's all for now. Now you know everything I think is

                    module stays around, but simply as a matter of presentation
                    it shouldn't clutter the Python standard library landscape.
                    Maybe that's just a matter of organizing how the stdlib is
                    documented online. I want some editorial flavor to that
                    presentation.

                <li>
                    I'd like
                    <a class="reference" href="py-std.html">py.std</a> to be in
                    builtins, so that you don't have to import every little
                    function you are using from the standard library. I think
                    this would significantly help programmer flow, with every
                    bit as much readability (probably more readability) than the
                    current mechanism.
                    <tt class="docutils literal"
                        ><span class="pre">std</span></tt
                    >
                    would not take the place of all uses of
                    <tt class="docutils literal"
                        ><span class="pre">import</span></tt
                    >
                    -- probably not even most uses -- but would be another way
                    to spell that, and would decrease the import garbage which
                    feels like litter at the top of my modules. That a module
                    uses
                    <tt class="docutils literal"
                        ><span class="pre">re</span></tt
                    >
                    or
                    <tt class="docutils literal"
                        ><span class="pre">os</span></tt
                    >
                    or
                    <tt class="docutils literal"
                        ><span class="pre">textwrap</span></tt
                    >
                    is not interesting or useful knowledge worthy of becoming a
                    kind of header for the module. If it uses
                    <tt class="docutils literal"
                        ><span class="pre">SimpleHTTPServer</span></tt
                    >
                    that <em>is</em> worthy of being noted in the header.
                    There's a distinction to be made there.
                    <tt class="docutils literal"
                        ><span class="pre">std</span></tt
                    >
                    offers that distinction.
                </li>
                <li>
                    I'd also add something like this
                    <a
                        class="reference"
                        href="http://www.phyast.pitt.edu/~micheles/python/documentation.html"
                        >decorator module</a
                    >
                    to the standard library. Right now decorators are slightly
                    harder to write than they need to be, and the resulting
                    decorators usually cover up important metadata about the
                    function they wrap. This module would encourage higher
                    quality decorators.
                </li>
                <li>
                    And <em>obviously</em> tabs would not be allowed for
                    indentation. I think any tab anywhere would be a syntax
                    error (you'd have to use
                    <tt class="docutils literal"
                        ><span class="pre">\t</span></tt
                    >
                    if you want to talk about tabs). Maybe 1- and 3-space
                    indentation would be disallowed too, but that's probably
                    overboard. I don't <em>like</em> 2-space indentation, but 1
                    is really hard to work with, and 3 spaces is just weird.
                    OTOH, you don't actually see them often, even by mistake.

                            I think adding

                                ><span class="pre">?</span></tt

                            to function names (or symbol names in general)
                            changes the feel of the language too much. I'd add
                            them if I was starting from zero, but at this point
                            I wouldn't want to use those because it would be too
                            jarring against the bulk of existing code. Dashes
                            are, of course, completely out ;) Also, they
                            conflict with outside naming conventions, making
                            some Python symbols hard to access from other
                            languages. I don't know if this is a big deal in
                            practice, but I think there's something good about
                            using a lowest-common-denominator in naming. Case
                            sensitivity is useful for the same reason (though
                            part of me would like to be case and underscore
                            insensitive, to remove the source of needless style
                            differences).
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                        <li>
                            There is a proposal for a

                            currying. Maybe in Python 2.5? I personally don't
                            think it's very readable in practice.
                            <tt class="docutils literal"

                            I agree that a nicer interactive prompt -- roughly
                            based on ipython I imagine -- would be very useful.

                            Local variable dumping is possible currently, but
                            not enabled in the default traceback. I don't know
                            if it should be -- I think it's overwhelming except
                            in interactive environments. It should be included
                            in more interactive environments; maybe standard
                            library support would help. Goes with the
                            <tt class="docutils literal"

                            GUI library... seems too hard, even for 4K ;) If it
                            hasn't happened outside of the standard library, how
                            can it happen inside? Plus GUIs are the past, the

                    I very much want to see 'locals' and 'globals' be sort of

                    bookmarks, protocols and REST style programming. What I see
                    as a limitation in web style programming is the lack for

                        The GUI stuff was really my slightly facetious rejection
                        of those people who complain about how inelegent web
                        programming is, and how it should be more like GUI
                        programming. I think they are just opening a can of
                        worms for themselves, by trying to impose a style of
                        programming they are familiar with to a domain where it
                        is not appropriate. Of course, I also think GUI
                        programming is a bit retro all considered -- I genuinely
                        think that as a user, not just as a programmer. But that
                        only directs my interest, it doesn't really effect the

                        String iteration just doesn't make sense. They don't
                        yield characters... they just yield smaller strings.
                        Strings that contain strings that contain strings.
                        Strings just aren't containers in Python -- they are
                        indexable, but to iterate something should be a
                        container. It's only (IMHO) an accident of an earlier
                        Python that didn't have the iterator protocol, that you
                        can iterate over strings. Strings should grow a method
                        like
                        <tt class="docutils literal"
                            ><span class="pre">.chars()</span></tt
                        >
                        that yields all the characters. Of course, not backward
                        compatible, but the errors should be obvious
                        (&quot;TypeError: strings are not iterable&quot;).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I've been thinking about the
                        <tt class="docutils literal"
                            ><span class="pre">self</span></tt
                        >
                        thing more. It's one of the hardest to resolve issues
                        (and I doubt it will be resolved). But I think it would
                        be reasonable if functions defined in a class scope
                        meant something different than a function defined
                        outside of a class scope. So if you were injecting a
                        function definition into a class, it would (reasonably)
                        work just like it does now, with an explicit
                        <tt class="docutils literal"
                            ><span class="pre">self</span></tt
                        >
                        parameter. But if you are doing it in a class scope, the
                        metaclass (<tt class="docutils literal"
                            ><span class="pre">type</span></tt
                        >) wraps the function in some fashion. It seems less
                        intrusive than class-private variables, even (which are
                        statically determined).

                    <p>
                        The self parameter also works badly with decorators,
                        though the same might be true if that parameter was
                        removed. Getting a decorator to act properly with a
                        method and with a function is hard.

                    I certainly agree with some of the changes, like something
                    as basic as proper relative imports. But I think I hear too
                    many &quot;GUI is old style, the web is the future&quot;
                    comments from a lot of programmers that are more
                    over-enthusiasm for new web technologies rather than a
                    careful look at why we keep and discard old/new technologies
                    in general. As others have pointed out, even new
                    asynchronous web technologies are still unidirectional in
                    one sense: the client makes a request, and only then does
                    the server send a reply. Web servers don't initiate requests
                    to web browsers, although traditional networked GUI
                    applications do this all the time. In tech history, we've
                    gone from assembly language (independent of hardware), to
                    portable languages (independent of assembly language), and
                    now to various styles of cross-platform (independent of OS
                    or basic platform). It's not just the web, but any
                    successful model of cross-platform apps that is the future.
                    The web is the future only because the browser is
                    ubiquitous, but in the end I still have to install Firefox,
                    etc. to be able to use the latest web technology. With
                    things like PyGTK and wxPython, I can have the same ubiquity
                    for GUI apps too. It's all the same: I download the app
                    through my browser when I visit a page, or I download the
                    Python script and run it. (P.S. I do agree with a lot of
                    Ian's points in general. Sorry if this sounds like
                    trolling).

                    I don't personally find Python wishlists that interesting,
                    especially the ones which propose language changes, but it's
                    good to see that you've touched on issues with the runtime
                    itself because that is where Python (the platform) should be
                    innovating, or at least fixing itself a fair amount. The
                    problem is that because the language syntax is the thing
                    most people have direct experience with (and one can become
                    superficially acquainted with Python in that way, provoking
                    the &quot;whitespace sucks&quot; arguments offered by
                    detractors/newcomers), people feel more inclined to suggest
                    tweaks which frequently say more about their own habits (at
                    many different levels) rather than to seriously think about
                    some of the harder issues - things like concurrency,
                    performance, predictability, memory usage and library
                    support - and then provide improvements in those areas. And
                    when the harder issues do manage to enter the scene,
                    proposals like optional static typing emerge: the arguably
                    lazy and inadequate approach to dealing with such issues.

                <p>
                    Certainly, I don't see Python diminishing in (relative)
                    popularity because of the lack of some language constructs
                    or notation: it's more likely to happen because Python
                    doesn't conveniently work well with or support other,
                    popular technologies, isn't perceived to scale well (in a
                    way that involves convenient programming techniques), or
                    isn't perceived to have good enough documentation - the
                    latter being another story entirely.

                <p>
                    My personal feeling is that a multi-line lambda is a
                    mistake, like Guido says. However, I agree with the
                    functionally oriented people that having to use a local
                    named function breaks code locality and tends to make it
                    hard to follow the code in Python written with a more
                    functional flavor.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I think that the right Pythonic answer is to introduce a
                    syntax kind of like ruby blocks where a function call can
                    optionally be followed by a colon, then arg list and a suite
                    underneath and that the arguments and suite would be
                    converted to a local function passed as the last argument to
                    the function. Here is an example:
                </p>
                <pre class="literal-block">
def open_in( filename, block ):
  f = open( filename )
  try:
     return block( f )
  finally:
     close(f)


max_char = open_in( &quot;foo.txt&quot; ): (f)
  x = 0
  for l in f:
     x = max(x, len(l))
  return x
</pre
                >
                <p>Or something like that. There are a few warts:</p>
                <ul class="simple">
                    <li>
                        The arg list of the anonymous block is awkward, maybe
                        another colon at the end would help.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The block is a lexical closure, not in the same frame as
                        the outside function so you get the usual assignment to
                        local problem, but its worse because it looks like a
                        suite in the local scope the same way
                        <tt class="docutils literal"
                            ><span class="pre">for</span></tt
                        >
                        and
                        <tt class="docutils literal"
                            ><span class="pre">while</span></tt
                        >
                        suites are. That makes its more confusing.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        In a similar vein you need a return or yield in the
                        block to get a result out which makes simple things like
                        reduce look painful (but list comprehension saves
                        filters and maps).
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    To see what I mean about the return or yield thing, here is
                    an example. First the new form of
                    <tt class="docutils literal"
                        ><span class="pre">reduce</span></tt
                    >:
                </p>
                <pre class="literal-block">
def reduce( l, v, f ):
  for x in l:
    v = f( v, x )
  return initial
</pre
                >
                <p>Now, the clunky way to write a sum:</p>
                <pre class="literal-block">
sum = reduce( x, 0 ): (a,b)
    return a+b
</pre
                >
                <p>Vs, the more elegant (IMHO):</p>
                <pre class="literal-block">
sum = reduce( x, 0 ): (a,b)
    a+b
</pre
                >
                <p>
                    However, sum is a simple contrived example because of course
                    sums, products, any, and all should be built in, and
                    possibly the only real uses involve suites large enough that
                    return or yield is help in understanding, instead of a
                    hindrance.

                        is. Also, that dot is really small. As a separator
                        that's size fine -- good even -- but if it is an
                        independent modifier that's bothersome. Plus I'm not so
                        much looking to save a few keystrokes by taking it out
                        of the signature, as much as bringing some symmetry in

                    &quot;Turning = into an expression. To generalize: dynamic
                    typing adds some usually shallow errors in return for far
                    more expressive code. Assignment as an expression adds some
                    really obnoxious errors (ones that don't raise exceptions)
                    in return for minor expressiveness. That = isn't an

                    I like the way you're handling self and cls. One thing to
                    note here is that any method that contains a self. is an
                    instance method, any method that contains a cls. is a class
                    method if it doesn't contain a self. as well. If it contains
                    neither, it's a static method. Both the classmethod and
                    staticmethod functions go away.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Another minor point here is that allowing both self. and
