                on python-dev. Most of the discussion centers around two points,
                but I'll let you read the thread to find out what those points
                are. (A hint: the actual debate is a little boring)
            </p>
            <p>
                Anyway, while reading I came upon
                <a
                    class="reference"
                    href="http://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-dev/2005-January/050831.html"
                    >this post</a
                >
                from Phillip Eby that had a good quote, talking about an aspect
                of interfaces and adaptation:
            </p>
            <blockquote>
                IOW, adaptation is all about &quot;as a&quot; relationships from
                concrete objects to abstract roles, and between abstract roles.
                Although one may colloquially speak of using a screwdriver
                &quot;as a&quot; hammer, this is not the case in adaptation. One
                may use a screwdriver &quot;as a&quot; pounder-of-nails. The
                difference is that a hammer might also be usable &quot;as
                a&quot; remover-of-nails. Therefore, there is no general
                &quot;as a&quot; relationship between pounder-of-nails and
                remover-of-nails, even though a hammer is usable &quot;as&quot;
                either one. Thus, it does not make sense to say that a
                screwdriver is usable &quot;as a&quot; hammer, because this
                would imply it's also usable to remove nails.

                    Ironic. I understand that quote perfectly well, but only as
                    long as I forget nearly everything I know about hammers and
                    screwdrivers. No problem there, but for the record:
                </p>
                <ol class="loweralpha simple">
                    <li>
                        a certain kind of hammer (the claw hammer) can also be
                        used to remove nails (the claw end being the business
                        end in this case); ball-peen hammers, sledge hammers,
                        and various assorted mallets have proven themselves,
                        time and again, ineffective in removing nails. Let's not
                        even imagine jack hammers and steam hammers in the nail
                        removal scenario.

                    <li>
                        screwdrivers (flat-bladed screwdrivers, anyway) can be
                        used to remove nails with delightful results, and it
                        makes perfect sense to say so.
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    There's probably some philosophical point to be made here,
                    but its general statement escapes me.
