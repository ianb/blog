                Then Jason Fried says it's not awesome, and it's theft and all
                that. He is wrong: <strong>this is totally awesome</strong>.
                Why? Because it's absurd and silly, but also shows a rather
                bizarre interaction with branding. Clearly the consumer realizes
                that the Panasonic sticker does not make the TV into a
                Panasonic; and yet not only do they want the sticker put on, but
                people come in with a <em>preference</em> for which brand of
                absurdity they desire. This all probably came about because
                brands were a class signifier, but it's amusing to see it morph
                into something else. Anyway, Jason Fried concludes...
            </p>
            <blockquote>
                You know, everyone wants corporations to be more like people --
                more responsible, more honest, more respectful of the
                environment, etc. Yet we're not as quick to treat corporations
                like people. We want to see what we can to do scam them. We want
                to see what we can do to take advantage of them. We call it
                awesome when people take their brands or their IP. Respect is a
                two-way street.

            <p>
                I can't decide what about this paragraph is wrong. And yet the
                paragraph makes no sense to me. I simply can't parse the logic.
            </p>
            <p>
                Well... I guess I think that we have ethical obligations to
                other people, and we have zero fundamental ethical obligations
                to corporations. Any obligation we have to corporations is
                derivative of the obligations to people; if hurting a
                corporation hurts people, then that's wrong. If a certain legal
                structure (like trademark) creates a more civilized and
                predictable market where producers can build deserved
                reputations, and that helps people, then that legal structure is
                good. But there's no way in hell I'm going to give corporations
                the same consideration I give humans. The more I think about it,
                the more offensive the very idea is to me. If I was religious, I
                would find the very idea an offense against God. Literally -- I
                do not think that is too extreme of a stance. To give
                corporations that consideration is to say that humans are
                capable of creating entities as deserving of moral consideration
                as humans themselves are deserving; it is to bestow as much
                importance onto our creations as onto God's. But I don't believe
                in God, I'm just a humanist, so I can't use such lofty
                language... but I still take the <em>human</em> part very
                seriously, and find Jason's moral logic to be deeply flawed.
            </p>
            <p>
                Anyway, I digress... I don't really think it would be good if
                you get the sticker of your choice in the US. In part because
                it's just stupid. But when brand turns into class, it makes me
                happy to see people subvert that brand, as it subverts class
                distinctions in some way as well. It's a little disappointing
                because it also is driven by class, driven by vanity and a
                person's aspiration to be something they are not (in this case,
                a consumer of more-expensive electronics). But the subversion
                also unintentionally removes a tool of class distinction,
                reduces the distinction itself to absurdity. And that is
                awesome.

                    I totally agree with your position on whether one should
                    &quot;respect&quot; corporations. Consider the Sony rootkit
                    affair: had some lone hacker distributed a rootkit which got
                    installed on numerous computers, they'd be facing jail time
                    in various countries and hefty fines. If Sony don't manage
                    to wriggle their way out of penalties, what's really going
                    to happen? Will anyone be &quot;doing time&quot; for their
                    corporate strategy decisions? Nope. Will Sony be barred from
                    trading in various markets? Nope. And any money they have to
                    pay up in damages will clearly be levied in the prices of
                    subsequent products and services. The stock price will dip
                    for a short while before it becomes evident that unethical
                    corporate behaviour is rarely punished, or at least not for
                    very long.

                <p>
                    &quot;Corporations are people&quot; is just a convenient
                    scam, engineered by irresponsible and unethical capitalists
                    who'd rather have some imaginery entity's neck on the block
                    rather than their own when being called in to account for
                    their disgraceful behaviour.

                    In regards to Jason Fried's comment, I think that one can
                    argue that you should respect corporations just like you
                    respect people. However, just as when someone else
                    disrespects you, you are going to disrespect them or at the
                    least, not go out of your way to treat them with respect.
                    When a company is a socially-aware and responsible company,
                    I will then treat them likewise.

                    You’re confusing motivations here. We don’t want
                    corporations to be more like people. We want people to be
                    themselves, and stop hiding behind corporations.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The corporations themselves are <em>not</em> people, and
                    when we treat them as if they’re the same as people, we get
                    the disconnect of “brand identity”, corporation with
                    protected free speech, and other madness.

                    Don't you think we should respect their

                <p>
                    That said, Fried seems to be half a step away from imply
                    that we, as individuals, aren't entitled to any more ethics
                    or respect than what we accord to corporations.

                    And that's bullshit, but I wouldn't be surprised if some

                    This is slightly off at a tangent, or at any rate a far
                    extrapolation from, your original point, but: suppose we
                    ever &quot;build&quot; something that passes the Turing
                    Test. &quot;Build&quot; in quotes because I think such a
                    think is more likely to come from a not very controlled
                    evolutionary/growth process than from any kind of top-down
                    design - shit, sentient perl! - than from any kind of
                    top-down design. And therefore &quot;God&quot; for some
                    value of the term is agruably involved.
                </p>
                <p>
                    But anyway, if such a thing does come into being, being the
                    product of a human-initiated process, is it then in any
