                Clearly this primitive space plane must have been a sacred

                Then he goes on to a more rational explanation of why the
                Shuttle Program (and space station) look like they do, much of
                it rooted in the Cold War. Now that those goals are irrelevant,
                its purpose becomes circular:

                <p>
                    In the thirty years since the last Moon flight, we have
                    succeeded in creating a perfectly self-contained manned
                    space program, in which the Shuttle goes up to save the
                    Space Station (undermanned, incomplete, breaking down,
                    filled with garbage, and dropping at a hundred meters per
                    day), and the Space Station offers the Shuttle a mission and
                    a destination. The Columbia accident has added a beautiful
                    finishing symmetry - the Shuttle is now required to fly to
                    the ISS, which will serve as an inspection station for the
                    fragile thermal tiles, and a lifeboat in case something goes
                    seriously wrong.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This closed cycle is so perfect that the last NASA
                    administrator even cancelled the only mission in which there
                    was a compelling need for a manned space flight - the Hubble
                    telescope repair and upgrade - on the grounds that it would
                    be too dangerous to fly the Shuttle away from the ISS,
                    thereby detaching the program from its last connection to
                    reason and leaving it free to float off into its current
                    absurdist theater of backflips, gap fillers, Canadarms and
                    heroic expeditions to the bottom of the spacecraft.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There is no satisfactory answer for why all this commotion
                    must take place in orbit. To the uneducated mind, it would
                    seem we could accomplish our current manned space flight
                    objectives more easily by not launching any astronauts into
                    space at all - leaving the Shuttle and ISS on the ground
                    would result in massive savings without the slighest impact
                    on basic science, while also increasing mission safety by
                    many orders of magnitude. It might even bring mission costs
                    within the original 1970's estimates, and allow us to
                    continue the Shuttle program well into the middle of the
                    century.

                The entire post is quite good, and altogether more informative
                than the conclusion that I quote here.
