                This is only one of several features Chris mentions, but my
                point is one of proof-of-concept -- most of the features he
                wants can be implemented separately and in a highly decoupled
                way using WSGI middleware (or sometimes simply mundane
                libraries). The advantages aren't just testability, but also
                simplicity (include what you care about, replace what's broken
                for you) and the potential for the kind of distributed
                development that open source relies on.

                    The transaction manager in zope is decoupled and already
                    provides a much more robust and well tested interface.

                <p>Only real dependency is the zope.interface package.</p>
                <p>
                    I know its fashionable to rewrite things from scratch in
                    python, and to bash on zope, but its just sad sometimes how
                    much stuff people put out that just can't meet any real
                    world applications beyond their initial design constraints
                    or toy apps, because they were never written with
                    flexibility in mind or the needed domain expertise.
                </p>
                <p>
                    the zope developers are solving complex real world problems
                    today, might as well learn something from their expertise.

                        Sure; this was just an example, and I wasn't proposing
                        it replace anything; that's why it just went in a
                        scratch directory. The code you link to would replace
                        <tt class="docutils literal"

                        themselves; except it calls

                        for logging and debugging, and two-phase commit. All
                        good code, I'm sure.

                        In generally WSGI/middleware applies to the integration
                        of code like that into the request cycle; if the
                        transaction handling code was linked to WSGI that would
                        be a bad sign. It's best that the integration code be
                        short, since the transaction code should also be usable
                        outside of a web request, and if the integration code is
                        long then that's a sign the code being integrated is
                        obtuse or incomplete.

                        wrap the Zope transaction manager into a WSGI
                        application interface as above and the world can take

                        I think for 90% of the use cases, Zope's implementation
                        is far too complicated. In typical cases, you're using a
                        DBAPI driver and you have a database connection (perhaps
                        pooled, but this is an orthogonal issue) per request. In
                        the end, if there is an exception, you rollback;
                        otherwise you commit. It isn't that hard. I'd rather not
                        include a huge chunk of code like that in my webserver
                        unless I absolutely need it. Minimilism is a very good
                        thing.

                    +100 on the pipelining of components ala WSGI/Paste to get
                    some of this stuff done. I think wherever it's appropriate
                    to factor something out into WSGI middleware (authentication
                    is a great example, as are sessions, an error renderer, and
                    maybe a txn manager), it feels really good to do so. I'm
                    going to try to take a closer look at Paste as I continue
                    thinking about what would make a great appserver stack.
