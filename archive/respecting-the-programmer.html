            <p>
                In general, Python requires you trust your programmers. People
                give Java grief about its restricted environment and static
                typing, but if you don't trust the programmer to do a good job,
                at least with Java they (maybe) can't mess things up as badly
                for everyone else working on a project. You can mess things up
                royally with Python. I like working with a language that
                respects my intelligence -- no final classes, no type
                restrictions, no (truly) private methods -- but that's not
                without its costs.
            </p>
            <p>
                In general, Python rewards highly-skilled programmers with a
                considerably increased productivity, moreso than in low-level
                languages. We talk about how Python is also easy to learn and
                maintain, and that's still true, but it doesn't mean that it
                evens out the differences in productivity between programmers.
                In fact, quite the opposite, it makes those most productive
                programmers more productive and more valuable. That Python is
                easy to learn and maintain means that there's less risk in using
                a highly skilled, highly productive programmer. In other
                languages you risk being left with a program that only another
                highly skilled programmer can maintain, and that's less likely
                to occur with Python (for an appropriate definition of
                &quot;highly skilled&quot;).
            </p>
            <p>
                Also, Python encourages agile methodologies, even if you aren't
                explicitly trying to use agile methodologies. They just work
                well. Agile methodologies <em>also</em> work well when you can
                have a more intimate relationship between developer and project
                manager or customer. Hiring in India or elsewhere makes that
                intimate relationship harder to create.
            </p>
            <p>
                Finally, to be frank, Python is not the language for companies
                who expect mediocrity in their programmers, and I think that
                outsourcing is for companies that expect mediocrity.
            </p>
            <p>
                I don't mean to insult Indian programmers -- certainly there are
                Indian programmers who are just as good as a good programmer in
                the U.S.: able to communicate well, able to work independently,
                able to intelligently judge tradeoffs, etc. But those aren't the
                cheap Indian programmers. This isn't about nation of origin.
                Outsourcing is about turning programmers into a commodity, and
                you can only make a commodity out of something where quality
                isn't an issue. In the case of programming, that means you must
                expect the lowest common denominator of quality given the
                constraints. Because shitty code is always shitty (even in Java)
                the constraints for outsourcing typically include heavy-weight
                methodologies and a high degree of formality.
            </p>
            <p>
                I think it's stupid to look at programming as a commodity, but
                it's <em>way</em> more stupid with Python. I don't think
                outsourcing will hurt the Python community.
            </p>
            <p>
                The corollary: if you don't want to be outsourced, focus on
                methodologies and tools that respect you as a programmer, that
                respect your intelligence, judgement, and motivations. If you
                do, you put a bit more power in your hands, away from
                institutions. You don't want to be a

                and you don't want to be a commodity.

                    You seem to assume Indians are unable to learn, do
                    intelligent stuff and, eventually, surpass you (i.e.,
                    American programmer). That is nothing but bigotry. You must
                    hang on to this idea of superiority when, in fact, the whole
                    point of discovering outsourcing was that there was no such
                    thing. If outsourcing happened, if the job is average, maybe
                    it's because /you/ were average, and overpaid. What will
                    happen when overseas programmers discover high-level
                    programming, abstraction, write decent compilers, grok the
                    kernel? Or should I rephrase it? What will happen when /you/
                    discover the rest of the world isn't dumb? Will you sit down
                    and cry? Because the only one difference here is that you,
                    as an American, live in a confort bubble. You consume to
                    much, read to little (never foreign literature in another
                    tongue), have all the opportunity available, a whole bunch
                    of money for research, etc, etc, and nothing but historical
                    conditions after WWII made you special (i.e., the fact the
                    Europe was self-destroying and the U.S. was selling them
                    weapons). You have /no/ idea what /we/ go through, the
                    scraping-and-saving to buy $100 books, to keep up-to-date,
                    to get into top univeristies (hey, even /your/
                    universities). Make no mistake, the average Indian
                    programming is probably worth twice his weight, while
                    Americans are overweight. Hello, world! (I am sorry if I
                    sound angry, but I am sick and tired of American programmers
                    whining, when they have it so easy, and coming onto
                    everybody with that attitude of superiority. The Wright
                    brothers didn't invent the airplane, Santos-Dumont did, and
                    he flew it right smack in the middle of Paris, /against/
                    frontal wind, and /everybody/ saw it. The Wright brothers:
                    they claimed the did it, nobody saw it. So tipically
                    &quot;superior.&quot;).

                    That is <em>not</em> what I was saying! The point is that
                    outsourcing is being done in an effort to commoditize of
                    labor, and as a commodity our value is driven down. When we
                    are cogs in a system of heavy methodologies we can be
                    replaced and manipulated; when we are intelligent actors
                    working with customers and employers who are close to peers
                    than controllers, then out value is higher, and we are no

                        Bigot? That's a harsh word. The point was being made
                        that American companies are making the mistake of
                        treating programmers like commodities. To illustrate his
                        point he mentions the common practice of outsourcing to
                        India to put warm bodies in front of computers. He
                        certainly doesn't say that as a rule programmers from
                        India are not competent. He does say that overly cheap
                        labor from India is usually not as competent as their
                        better educated more experience Indian counterparts. I
                        would make the same claim about US programmers. Infact,
                        his opinions seem to be more critical of America, then
                        anyone, or anywhere else.

                        However, in making your point about your perceived
                        bigotry against Indians you go on to call Americans
                        overweight, Not well read, ungrateful, etc... You also
                        make questionable comments like &quot;Will you sit down
                        and cry?&quot;. Given these remarks it's hard to take
                        your claim of someoneelse's bigotry seriously.

                            Amazing. What a perfect illustration of how little
                            in common many supposedly religious folks have with
                            their faith, with humanity and with common sense.

                            I realize that its pointless to remind &quot;Real
                            Programmer&quot; that Jesus never would pray for the
                            annihilation of millions of people. I also realize
                            that folks like &quot;Real Programmer&quot; will
                            never admit to nor recognize in themselves the total
                            lack of morality they display with such thinking.

                            I realize that its seemingly pointless to comment on
                            such a rant, perhaps only serving to inflame an
                            argument that might otherwise die a natural death in
                            some persistent list structure -- but I fear the
                            truly sane and moral have been letting the crazies
                            get away unchallenged for far too long.

                        <p>Get over this bigotry all of you.</p>
                        <p>There are good and bad programmers.</p>
                        <p>
                            There are bigots on either side. I have seen enough
                            postings from rabid nationalists from India and the
                            USA.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            We are all being manipulated by the Corporate Greed
                            Machine. If they discovered small green men on Mars
                            that would do the work for free, do you think
                            anybody in the USA or India would have a chance?
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Stop fighting against each other. Make a stand
                            against the greedy CEOs and the capitalist system
                            because it is creating a lot of misery around the
                            world. Fact is, this should be a wake up call for
                            middle class America to realise that the capitalist
                            system is going to screw you. India, you WILL be
                            next when you become too successful and hence demand
                            and supply rules elevate your salaries.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Fight this exploitation. Form co-operatives and
                            guilds and resource locally. Resign from
                            corporations that exploit globalisation. I am
                            resigning from IBM in two weeks time (note NOT being
                            given the boot) and working for a local company. I
                            will not support this ethos.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The problem with most people is they want to ignore
                            the difficult choices. Indians are highly motivated
                            and deserve to do well if you think an easy life is
                            your right. Get over it. Train up, prove your worth.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            No I don't accept outsourcing because it destroys
                            local communities. Guilds and cooperatives will be
                            one way to maintain the link between preserving
                            local community and high quality work; employees
                            reap the benefits of their own work, not CEOs.
                            Co-operatives are democratic (you reading this,
                            American?) not socialistic or communistic in nature.

                        I think the writer made some good points that you have
                        ignored in accusing him of bigotry. The point remains
                        that Indian programmers are often glorified clerks or
                        worse, able to do &quot;menial&quot; tasks (that amount
                        to little more than glorified data entry) when told, but
                        unable to perform algorithmic analyses, system design,
                        and independent crafting of significant solutions.

                    <p>
                        The major fault I would find with the write-up is not
                        his criticism of Indian programmers, but the fact that
                        he does not pinpoint the cause of their mediocrity,
                        which is the lack of adequate training in formal
                        computer science and mathematics. (Yes, even at the
                        IITs.) I know this from personal experience. Ever notice
                        that there are very few Indians (comparatively) among
                        the top developers of Linux and other open source, or
                        even at the comparable top rungs of Microsoft?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        And yes, I am an Indian myself and quite patriotic, so
                        kindly refrain from waving the flag in my face.

                            The writer may have made some good points but the
                            bigotry is obvious. Not as bad as the &quot;angry
                            reply&quot; but it's still bigotry. As a programmer
                            who considers himself logical, saying
                            &quot;Americans ARE better&quot; doesn't make any
                            sense. Programmers are individuals - not groups. The
                            ability to program varies greatly among individuals.
                            I've met American programmers who are blow mediocre.
                            I've also met some exceptional programmers from
                            India and Iran. You could reverse the countries in
                            that statement and it would still be true.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            What America has is a system that tries to stay out
                            of the way and allows people to develop and benefit
                            from their own talents. I have no doubt that there
                            are many people in the developing nations that,
                            given time and opportunity, will make great
                            contributions to the programming arts, as long a
                            their government or culture doesn't get in the way.
                            Some may not always like the system - it's the
                            reason why companies are allowed to outsource - but
                            we all benefit from it.

                            Agreed. Here students work mostly towards 'grades'
                            and exams. Most computer science students
                            (undergrads and grads) don't know what is
                            'programming'. The reason for this is 'India' has a
                            very poor educational system. They do have smart and
                            better programmers than those in US. Why are they
                            not popular will lead to thinking about the poor IT
                            facilities in this country (for eg: internet).

                            Ian Bicking is right. Outsourcing involve not just
                            &quot;software development&quot;. It involves whole
                            lot of &quot;psychology&quot; of the company that
                            take up the outsourcing activity. Driven by the
                            motive of profit, (more projects, more money), there
                            is a hidden urgency in completing projects, thereby,
                            the pressure is transferred to the ends of the
                            work-force. Naturally outsourcing produces
                            incompetency.

                            Please Pardon me for breaking my thoughts across

                            I believe it's self-motivation,passion and
                            opportunity that makes a person a better programmer
                            regardless of where you are from. The business world
                            always looks at applications in the least technical
                            way.They do not care if you have used the best
                            coding practices,Software methodologies,design
                            patterns etc. All they care about is the cost
                            associated with some emphasis on the user interface.
                            If you cut down on costs, programmers will try to
                            reduce the complexities associated and ignore
                            optimization techniques associated with use of
                            better algorithms outside of frameworks.

                            The business doesn't pay me a dime more If I use a
                            better algorithm for testing the primality of
                            numbers for example. It's the research and Open
                            Source world that provides room for innovation.

                            B.T.W talking about testing of primality of numbers,
                            undergrads from Indian Institute of
                            Technology-Kanpur came with a better algorithm than
                            Fermat's to test primality of numbers in polynomial
                            time.

                            I believe Computer Scientists show us programmers
                            the way and we simply try to incorporate their
                            algorithms and protocols knowingly or unknowingly.
                            Many of us are oblivious of what is being done in
                            the research arena.Here's an interesting profile of
                            a Computer Scientist with an Indian Origin who has
                            made significant contributions to data and wireless
                            networking .

                            My opinion is that most programmers develop software
                            to please the business (whether it involves low cost
                            or high cost). It's only a small bunch of self
                            motivated people that actually contribute to the
                            field of computer science.

                        I am an Indian professional, employing software
                        developers in java and lisp. I know something about
                        python too. I agree with the authors statements. C'mon
                        guys if the situation were reversed and America were

                    <p>
                        Also for the kind of pay programmers get paid they
                        hardly know their stuff. I have to spend 6-9 months on
                        even most MCA/MCM students for them to lean GOOD coding
                        practices.

                    <p>
                        Good programmers are always hard to find, get paid more
                        AND usually have intentions to settle or earn loads of
                        meny by working for 5-10 yrs. in the US..and then come
                        back to high flying jobs in India.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Thus even the HIGH END GREAT developers don't really
                        contribute to any aspect of the indian economic growth.

                    <p>
                        I wanted to use php, python in our software development
                        effort. Python as a language would have been the best
                        choice since we use object oriented techniques and
                        functional programming too..but i could not find any
                        decent pythin programmers who would possibly stick
                        around for a long time ..or could be replaced by other
                        python programmers!

                    <p>
                        Just remember 1 thing fellow indian...americans whining
                        about lost jobs is natural...I rememeber several indian
                        professionals who lost their jobs in he silicon valley,
                        had to relocate to bangalore and were as bitter as
                        &quot;true&quot; americans!...outsourcing dyanmics are
                        natural..but if someone like this guy makes a fair
                        comment.. then we should not be prejudiced..

                        Has anyone thought of the mediocre to totally
                        incompetent middle management in the US that drive work
                        out of this country ? There is a real need to put some
                        smart people in that layer of the organization. Also
                        there is a huge difference in management style in India
                        and US. Middle management in US suffers royally on that

                            What middle management? They were downsized during
                            the previous downturn? I know. I was once a member
                            of our proud middle class, and I tried to make
                            decisions that would benefit everyone as a whole,
                            not just myself or one little group. My gaze was
                            much longer than the end of my nose as I glanced
                            over the figures and knew the need for long-term
                            investment in our true #1 priority: people.

                        <p>
                            After being outsourced myself, I'm now forced to
                            start my whole career over, at a time when I should
                            be thinking about retirement (or even buying a
                            house, hello--I'll still be a first time home buyer
                            at age 65, but by then, what's the point?) I've
                            worked all my life in the States, but due to the
                            high cost of living and the continuous shrinkage of
                            our real wages, I'm afraid I haven't anything to
                            show for it. If anyone has a right to bitch, it
                            would be my class &lt;g&gt;.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            People (no matter what their race or country) SHOULD
                            BE PAID a living wage for the work they do! That's
                            why I think Henry Ford was such an innovator: not
                            because he &quot;invented&quot; the assembly line,
                            but because he paid his workers MORE THAN THE
                            AVERAGE RATE! Guess what they did? They went out and
                            bought his products (cars), and made him the
                            multimillionaire he became!
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            You can only make products sooooooooo cheap, before
                            you realize no matter HOW cheap you make them,
                            people WITHOUT MONEY will still NOT BUY THEM! The
                            real answer is not in making things cheaper and
                            faster (I can no longer say better, as that is
                            obviously without concern), but in pumping more
                            money into the hands of ordinary people so they can
                            spend it!

                        <p>
                            Or, as Mark Twain said, &quot;The Poor are better
                            than the Rich because they can do less damage.&quot;
                            If you give a Rich man a million dollars, you'll
                            never ever see it again. They will find some way of
                            holding on to it so no one else can ever get it. It
                            will be swallowed into the Black Hole of Calcutta
                            (is that expression still in use today?) If you give
                            that same amount to a poor man, you can
                            single-handledly REVIVE THE ECONOMY. Why, you ask?
                            Because he'll actually go out into the world and
                            SPEND it on things he needs, stimulate production,
                            and not grasp onto the last bleeding penny like the
                            Rich and greedy man will. I know people soooo tight,
                            they could sit on a lump of coal, and they would
                            $hit a diamond!

                            Unfortunately, the rich (read: multi-national
                            companies now in complete control of the world) in
                            this country have seen fit to have only a two class
                            system--themselves and everyone else. It used to be
                            that American businesses only treated foreigners as
                            bad as they're now treating everyone including our

                        for less money, thats why they are hired all over the

                When doing a real-world project with Zope, I found out that the
                only programmer in the (very good) team who got actual work done
                was the programmer who had read through the whole source tree of
                Zope, and supporting integration modules such as LDAP, Oracle
                etc etc. This was because unless you really get value from doing
                all your work from scratch and not reusing someone else's
                application servers and other components, you had to use modules
                coded by amateurs in just such a bad manner you suggest in this
                article. No Javadoc, no interfaces, no decent documentation. On
                larger projects where you don't code everything yourself, Python
                lacks so many of the advantages of other systems that it's not
                even funny. Never touching the stuff again, except when doing
                something it's actually suited for, system administration
                scripts.

                        Zope is not the example I would use to show off what can
                        be done with Python. It's always been a disappointment
                        to me, and many other people in the Python community.
                        Though honestly, that has a lot to do with the fact it
                        has been seen as The Way To Do The Web in Python; in
                        part because it was over-sold by early adopters, and
                        because there's no single compelling alternative. Zope
                        just isn't a good platform (at all) for doing
                        traditional database-backed websites, and it's going to
                        be disappointing to use it that way.

                        But, really, it should be a lesson. Python can be hard
                        to understand like anything else. It can be misdesigned
                        like anything else. In the case of Zope, I think it's a
                        matter of having been too ambitious. It's a terrible
                        shame that an example of those flaws is also the most
                        popular Python web programming platform. But there are

                    mistakes out in the compile step. And by that I don't mean
                    prevent evil/stupid coders from ruining your program, but
                    also catching errors where you made small typos or where you
                    forgot to update something after a refactoring or changing
                    of some code passage. In Python, Scheme or Obj-C or
                    Smalltalk (even Java) you have to wait for the runtime crash
                    (like NullPointerException). An ML program that compiles,
                    usually runs correct on the first try -- goodbye testing.
                    And Dijkstra had something when he said that testing can
                    only prove the presence of bugs, never their absence ;)

                        I'd be a bit more impressed with ML if there were more
                        kick-ass ML programs out there. If it's really
                        everything (some) people say it is, even with its small
                        user base there should be great things being produced
                        with it.

                    <p>
                        But anyway, I certainly wouldn't group ML with Java. I'd
                        probably put it alongside

                        ML's typing system certainly has very different
                        motivations than Java's.

                            Sure. ML probably should be more mainstreamy (though
                            OCaml IIRC does just that). The Lisp and FP
                            communities (I guess) consist more of
                            scientists/math people than programmers, so there
                            are no real app repositories, although there seems
                            to be work on that.

                        <p>
                            I wouldn't group ML and Java either (God, no!), but
                            their static typing solves lots of problems in my
                            experience (Java much less, though).

                <p>I would agree to Ian, on a lot of what he has said:</p>
                <ul class="simple">
                    <li>
                        Python promotes good developers: Yes it does. I do Java
                        at work, but if have to code for myself I would use
                        Python. But if I have to build a large commercial
                        application I would still use Java as I will not be able
                        to get 200 great developers.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Outsourcing is creating mediocracy: Yes and No. I would
                        say rapid outsourcing in the today's context is
                        promoting mediocracy as there aren't too many good
                        programmers around in India.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    But what I don't agree on is that Indian programmer is not
                    more economical (I would not say cheap) than his American
                    counterpart. A programmer of same competency would cost 3-4
                    times more in America than in India. India is just too good
                    a place when consider cost against productivity for a
                    programmer and this is what is driving outsourcing.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It is simple economics, globalizations and free markets
                    (Isnt’t these American values). I don’t know why there is a
                    big hue and cry now, and not when manufacturing moved from
                    America to South East Asian countries.

                    Totally agree. So called consultancies have commoditized
                    programming and are selling them by the pound. Unfortunately
                    there arent many quality detection tools ... and quality

                    completely undocumented? No documentation whatsoever? No
                    naming conventions? No proper indentation or readable code?

                    Well its a known fact that every business needs to cut
                    costs, while maintaining the quality. Who ever thinks
                    otherwise think again when you own a company. Indian
                    programmers are top notch and work for less money, thats why
                    they are hired all over the world, including microsoft, NASA
                    etc. for those who still understand teh value of Indian
                    programmers feel free to visit
