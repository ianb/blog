                such a large topic (the appropriateness of various
                abstractions).

            <p>I noticed this:</p>

                    On a middle-tier, for example, you quite often don't care
                    about caching, because you're just serving some incoming
                    HTTP request that's immediately going to go away thereafter.
                    So why cache?
                </p>
                <p>
                    [...] Part of the problem with most O/R mappings has been
                    that they immediately took on the problem of caching and
                    referential identity. If you ask for a particular customer
                    and get back a Customer object, the next time you ask for
                    that customer you get back exactly the same object. Well
                    that's a tough problem. It requires a gigantic hash table
                    that contains everything you've ever seen.

            </blockquote>
            <p>
                Of course, I noticed this because
                <a class="reference" href="http://sqlobject.org">SQLObject</a>
                does this sort of caching, and ensures referential identity. It
                wasn't very hard to implement, though there were some details
                that haven't been fully worked out until lately (expiring cached
                values, for instance -- which still probably confuses people
                because there's several levels of cache).
            </p>
            <p>
                Caching is important, and is
                <a
                    class="reference"
                    href="http://blog.colorstudy.com/ianb/weblog/2003/09/18.html"
                    >one of the great things about an ORM</a
                >, but there's also a lot of diversity in what caching needs
                people have. Just documenting the options to satisfy everyone is
                a pain, not to mention implementation. But referential identity
                was, to me, just a useful way of handling the implementation.

                It costs very little, and it doesn't even require caching.
                Here's how you can do it yourself (untested):
            </p>
            <pre class="literal-block">
class Cacher:
    def __init__(self):
        self.cache = {} # dict of weakrefs
        self.lock = threading.Lock()
    def get(self, id):
        &quot;Return object, or None&quot;
        val = None
        try:
            val = self.cache[id]()
            if val is not None: return val
        except KeyError:
            pass
        self.lock.acquire()
        try:
            val = self.cache[id]()
        except KeyError:
            return None
        else:
            if val is None:
                # expired weakref
                del self.cache[id]
                returnNone
        # otherwise we found one:
        self.lock.release()
        return val

    def put(self, id, obj):
        self.cache[id] = weakref.ref(obj)

    def finishPut(self):
        self.lock.release()
</pre
            >
            <p>to be used like:</p>
            <pre class="literal-block">
cache = Cacher()
obj = cache.get(1)
if obj is None:
    try:
        obj = NewObject(1)
        cache.put(1, obj)
    finally:
        cache.finishPut()

            >

                Like I said, it's untested, but something more complete is in
                <a
                    class="reference"
                    href="http://cvs.sourceforge.net/viewcvs.py/sqlobject/SQLObject/SQLObject/Cache.py?view=markup"
                    >SQLObject.Cache</a
                >.
            </p>
            <p>
                This is threadsafe code, which adds some peculiarities to it.
                First, we try to get the object without getting a lock -- this
                way most successful cache hits won't require locks at all. Then
                we retry with the lock set, just in case someone added something
                to the cache during that instant between
                <tt class="literal"
                    ><span class="pre">val</span> <span class="pre">=</span>
                    <span class="pre">self.cache[id]()</span></tt
                >
                and
                <tt class="literal"
                    ><span class="pre">self.lock.acquire()</span></tt
                >.
            </p>
            <p>
                Also, we have a pretty important contract with the caller, that
                if they get
                <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">None</span></tt> from
                <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">.get()</span></tt
                >, that they will call
                <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">.finishPut()</span></tt>
                promptly.
                <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">try:finally:</span></tt>
                is essential with locks, and here particularly. I do it this way
                because it may not be feasible for the cache to create objects.
                We have to maintain the lock during object creation, because we
                <em>might</em> just be creating an object that someone else
                wants at the same instance (pretty good chance of that,
                actually). If we were cleverer, maybe we could allow cache
                retrieval for other IDs to continue in spite of this lock (well,
                we do, so long as the cache hits are successful).
            </p>
            <p>
                This way for any ID only a single object will exists, which in
                the right application context (typically a single-process,
                multi-threaded context) can be very useful. Using weak
                references we aren't actually caching anything -- we are only
                keeping track of what already exists. The SQLObject
                implementation allows for caching as well, by keeping both a
                normal dictionary and a dictionary of weak references.
