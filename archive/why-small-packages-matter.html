                With Eggs and simpler installation and dependencies there's more
                opportunities to distribute smaller packages and split large
                packages up into pieces.
            </p>
            <p>

                I think this [splitting up of packages] is a big deal and too
                hope that we can &quot;explode&quot; Zope 3 into many eggs soon.
                Jim wants to do it for Zope 3.4, yay! Having smaller, more
                easily distributable Zope packages will also reduce the buy-in
                into Zope as a platform. For example, you won't have to ship
                with the ZMI anymore if you not only think it sucks but also
                find it disturbing to develop with.
            </blockquote>
            <p>
                Of course, I like this direction. But not because of small
                distributions; there's a small number of places where that
                matters (e.g., mobile phones), but for most of us the download
                time and disk space isn't a big deal. And after all, just
                because one app doesn't require the ZMI doesn't mean you don't
                have it installed -- if it is already there you aren't saving
                any disk space.

                The advantage I see in breaking up pieces is discipline,
                extensibility, and creating a hierarchy to the concepts in your
                library or framework.

            <blockquote>
                <p>
                    Given a big package, developers will sometimes say that the
                    package is loosely coupled on the inside, and if you want to
                    use
                    <tt class="docutils literal"
                        ><span class="pre">foo.x</span></tt
                    >
                    but not
                    <tt class="docutils literal"
                        ><span class="pre">foo.y</span></tt
                    >
                    that's fine, because they don't depend on each other.
                </p>
                <p>
                    How do you know they don't depend on each other? How do you
                    know they won't depend on each other in the future? How do
                    you know someone won't read about
                    <a
                        class="reference"

                    >
                    and factor out pieces that are shared between the two
                    modules? How do you know someone won't &quot;fix&quot; a bug
                    in
                    <tt class="docutils literal"
                        ><span class="pre">foo.z</span></tt
                    >
                    that both modules use, breaking something you depended on in
                    some interface?
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you use two different distributions for these two
                    modules, you actually have lots of ways of detecting these
                    problems and truly keeping the modules decoupled. It's not
                    automatic -- there's always opportunities to break things.
                    But the discipline of distribution boundaries (and other
                    separations like separate release schedules) will tend to
                    keep you honest about coupling.

                <p>
                    One argument for keeping things packaged together is that it
                    allows for <em>optional integration</em>, so that people who
                    want to use <em>all</em> the features get a more convenient
                    tool.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This means that, for instance, an object may have a method
                    that binds it to another module in the package. But it's
                    <em>optional</em>, because you don't have to call the
                    method. The programmer asked to trust that this
                    &quot;optional&quot; feature is truly optional may consider
                    all the questions raised under Discipline, but imagine that
                    these issues are addressed. So what's the problem?
                </p>
                <p>
                    In this case, the optional integration has a privileged
                    position. The original author's libraries get special hooks,
                    but the developer using those libraries doesn't get the same
                    access. You could

                    your own extension, but you'll only have created a horrible
                    coupled mess. You could avoid the extension entirely, of
                    course, but if the original author thought it was
                    sufficiently useful to create the extension it is likely
                    that another user of the library will feel the same.

            <blockquote>
                <p>
                    Ideally a system will be layed out with a nice hierarchy of
                    concepts:
                </p>
                <pre class="literal-block">
Library-A      Library-B
  |    \        /
  |     \      /
  |      \    /
Library-C \  /
           \/
        Library-D
           |
           |
        Library-E
</pre
                >
                <p>
                    To understand Library A you have to understand all of
                    Library C, D, and E. To understand Library D you only need
                    understand Library E.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Given a hierarchy like this, there's actually an advantage
                    to not using the entire framework/system. You don't need to
                    understand nearly as much, and learning a library is
                    probably the biggest overhead to using a library.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It can be argued that if you want to use Library A, you only
                    need to read about Library A. If the documentation is very
                    good, this is <em>somewhat</em> true. It is true if you use
                    it perfectly and write no buggy code and the libraries
                    themselves have no bugs and you don't need to do anything
                    that goes outside the bounds of what Library A provides.
                    This isn't my experience programming, and isn't typical when
                    using
                    <a
                        class="reference"

                    >.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There is also a hierarchy of stability. If Library E is a
                    moving target then you are just plain hosed. If someone
                    keeps making API changes in Library D you are also hosed. If
                    stability does not increase as you move down your stack then
                    the stack is a big ball of mud, even if at one isolated
                    moment it might seem like an elegant and stable system.
                </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
                For all these reasons when someone claims their framework is all
                spiffy and decoupled, but they just don't care to package it as
                separate pieces... I become quite suspicious. Packaging doesn't
                fix everything. And it can introduce real problems if you split
                your packages the wrong way. But doing it right is a real sign
                of a framework that wants to become a library, and that's a sign
                of Something I'd Like To Use.

                    I think you've formulated the concerns quite well. Zope (2.x
                    at least) seems similar in some ways to various Java
                    frameworks where one is presented with a huge number of .jar
                    files, a big configuration file with lots of sections, and
                    documentation which glosses over the dependencies within the
                    system. Consequently, as a developer, one has no confidence
                    in being able to remove stuff which is either blatantly
                    superfluous or worrying from a security perspective. Zope's
                    &quot;through the Web&quot; management is nice, but I
                    imagine that many people have wondered whether it could be
                    detached and omitted from certain kinds of production
                    systems.

                    Of course, one of the Python community's favourite
                    megaframeworks, Twisted, went through its own process of
                    decoupling a while back, and that may have made some of the
                    components more popular. The prospect of having to adopt a
                    huge blob which dwarfs one's own project is often something
                    which invigorates the reinventive tendencies of many Python
                    developers. Depending on or bundling some part of Twisted is
                    better than having to monitor the effects of a complicated
                    dependency on the whole thing.

                        From what I've seen, Twisted's refactoring is largely a
                        failure. It's not compatible with eggs, and
                        approximately zero people use the components separately
                        -- everyone seems to still use the sumo distribution.

                        I think the only thing it solved is the complaint that
                        it's not split up, I haven't seen that thread in a long
                        time. It may have also helped a bit with the release
                        management, but that matters to very few people.
                        Supporting eggs would be a huge benefit to application
                        and library developers, but they don't seem particularly
                        interested in doing it.

                            I think Twisted's refactoring was kind of like Zope
                            3's refactoring, which happened in theory previously
                            but no one used it. Actually getting usable isolated
                            packages out of Zope 3 was hard, just for technical
                            reasons, but also because the people doing the work
                            didn't have much incentive to deal with the issues
                            like getting the tarballs pushed somewhere and
                            whatnot. Now they are taking a different tack with
                            Eggs, and I think the result is potentially useful
                            where the previous one wasn't. I think entry points
                            are also really important here, because it's an
                            actual novel feature which makes packaging matter as
                            more than just a way to deflect criticism.

                            I also think people will really use the new Zope
                            refactoring, if it is done well -- especially
                            extracting small things (like, say, the transaction
                            manager) instead of trying to extract
                            &quot;optional&quot; things like the ZMI. The
                            transaction manager is useful on its own, the ZMI is
                            not. Similarly, the things Twisted should extract
                            are things like the Deferred stuff, not the optional
                            pieces like the protocol handlers. Right now I think
                            the lack of a solid idiom for async programming
                            (barring the use of the entire Twisted stack, or ad
                            hoc callbacks) really keeps people from using that
                            kind of programming in places where it might make
                            sense.

                <p>
                    I'm in the midst of a project using turbogears. I do
                    distribute my application as several separate eggs, split on
                    the major fault-lines in the concepts. i.e. a datalayer,
                    management, shop, plugins, migration etc. It has been hugely
                    beneficial to do this because of the aforementioned
                    decoupling. Also because it enables decoupled updates to
                    components with reduced risk to the whole.
