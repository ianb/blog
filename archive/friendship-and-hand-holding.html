                and was similarly miffed by the criticism of Python's
                friendliness (and based on hearsay at that).
            </p>
            <p>
                Eric makes a very good point: Ruby people aren't as nice as
                bunny rabbits. The obvious corollary is that raising bunny
                rabbits is better for the spirit than programming Ruby.
            </p>
            <p>
                Eric's other conclusion is that everyone thinks they themselves
                are friendly.
            </p>
            <p>
                But to be fair, some communities aren't that friendly. I'm sure
                most Perl people are nice -- all the one's I've met are -- but
                some of their forums (mailing lists, newsgroups, etc) can be a
                bit on the mean side. And they recognize this. That's really
                something in the nature of the specific communities and forums,
                not necessarily the individuals. (And sometimes it's just a
                reflection of the medium -- large IRC channels seem to breed
                meanness.)
            </p>
            <p>
                Or another instance -- PHP isn't very monolithic as a community,
                but it seems like internally to many PHP projects there can be a
                lot of strife, moreso than I see in other languages. I don't
                know any language with as many forked projects as PHP, and each
                of those is usually the result of some social breakdown.
                Something is going on there.
            </p>
            <p>
                And at times people on comp.lang.python have had bits of
                soul-searching about it becoming less friendly. I think that
                really has happened -- the group isn't as friendly as it once
                was. The best explanation I've seen is donors' fatigue. The
                community changes as it becomes bigger and older, the weight of
                past decisions becomes heavier, and as the original core
                community moves on. How many 'bots are left in comp.lang.python
                these days?
            </p>
            <p>
                Now I'm not saying comp.lang.python is a mean-spirited place.
                But Python has calcified in certain ways that Ruby has not. Just
                like a child is more flexible than an adult, the Ruby community
                is more flexible than the Python community. I think there's more
                open space in Ruby than Python, there's more openness to some
                new ideas, there's more acceptance of the opinion of outsiders.
                The barriers to contribution are smaller. Backward
                compatibility? Not as big a deal with Ruby. Add new syntax?
                Suggestions along those lines won't be dismissed for Python, but
                <em>all</em> new syntax is met with extreme suspicion; all the
                moreso if you aren't aware of past conversations on the matter.
                And there are <em>lots</em> of past conversions on just about
                any new syntax you'll think of -- which makes it hard to jump in
                and contribute ideas on that level. So I suspect you'll get a
                more friendly reaction from Rubyists on syntax. But then, the
                cutting edge of Python hasn't been the core language for a long
                time (by design).
            </p>
            <p>
                So I don't think it's wrong to think about these things and
                compare. I think it's also worth recognizing slip, and trying to
                rectify it (though I'm not pointing out anything useful on that
                regard here; just noting that such criticism
                <em>could usefully exist</em>)

                    It's not just age, I think: it's the fact that the stakes
                    are higher. Every change to Python affects a lot more code
                    that people depend on than changes to Ruby. Another result
                    of Python being older is that people have begun to recognize
                    (some of) the bad ideas, and can be a bit terse in their
                    responses to the N+1th proposal something shot down N times
                    already. A third factor (and, in my experience with #python,
                    the primary reason large IRC channels breed meanness) is the
                    conflict between people who want to understand the new guy's
                    motivations and desires, try to guide him to a workable
                    solution, and refuse to help him shoot himself in the foot,
                    and the people who see no problem in helping them aim
                    straight down and blast away, so to speak. In a larger
                    community, there's less room or time for persuasion and
                    argument in either direction.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So, yes, as a community grows it becomes less tolerant of
                    certain things. The alternative, so far as I can tell, is
                    for the community to fragment and waste time pursuing each
                    faction's agenda (See Scheme for a good example). The
                    important thing for contributors is to avoid burning out; if
                    you've had a certain conversation a hundred times, the
                    hundred and first can tempt one to short-temperedness
                    quickly :) On the other hand, if being more friendly means
                    accomodating people with screamingly bad ideas, like
                    willy-nilly syntax changes, or ruby's &quot;safe&quot; (I
                    searched Google for 'ruby safe' to see if it is really as
                    bad as I remembered; all I found were security advisories,
                    so I'm guessing &quot;yes&quot;), then I am in favor of
                    unfriendliness.
