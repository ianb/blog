</div><h1>Sprint Day 2</h1>
 
<div class="document">
<p>Well, it was a couple days ago, but I thought I'd follow up a little on <a class="reference" href="http://blog.ianbicking.org/error/HTTP_INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR.html.var/pycon2005-sprint-day-1.html">Sprint Day 1</a>.</p>
<p>A couple new people came in -- Rick and Karl from <a class="reference" href="http://axiomfire.com">axiomfire</a> (where Tracy works).  They were both new hires and new to Webware (though not Python).  Also Aaron Lav came in for the second half of the day.</p>
<p>We (Tracy and Eric really) got the to-do application mostly working.  I'm afraid I left Tracy and Eric to struggle with configuration issues for a while; they seemed to be working together well, and I thought I'd let them go at it, but they were working on some things that I could have answered more quickly for them, to let them move on to more interesting problems.  They found a bug in <a class="reference" href="http://www.owlfish.com/software/wsgiutils/">WSGIUtils</a> on the way, where it didn't close the application iterator, and <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">wsgikit.session</span></tt> really depends on that.  <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">wsgikit.lint</span></tt> actually caught this, but I didn't pay attention to the error -- because <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">lint</span></tt> checks if it's been closed in <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">__del__</span></tt>, it can't raise a real error (errors in <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">__del__</span></tt> methods are ignored, though a somewhat vague warning message is printed).  <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">lint</span></tt> now prints a better error message.  One thing I should advertise better is that <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">lint</span></tt> is really the best WSGI compliance test out there right now, but it only tests things as they go by; something else has to be used to excersize the functionality.  <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">wsgikit.tests.echotest</span></tt> excersizes the application a little, but it's limited.</p>
<p>Aaron and Karl got the login middleware working (<tt class="literal"><span class="pre">wsgikit.login</span></tt>), which handles authentication/identification but <em>not</em> authorization.  I hate that authentication and authorization both start with &quot;auth&quot;, because I realize I match words on their first four letters.  I think this naming convention alone is probably a big part of why Zope 2 and Apache have bad authentication layers that are mixed with authorization -- if the terminology was better people wouldn't accidentally fold together the two ideas.</p>
<p>Rick worked on some documentation, but unfortunately didn't get it checked in -- I hope that'll come through at some point, even if it isn't complete.  I think it's important to get everything checked in, regardless of state, because it's easy to lose things on people's hard drives when the sprint is done.</p>
<p>I worked on a couple things.  I started testing <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">wsgikit.urlparser</span></tt>, and using TDD for the new features.  That went really well.  I also built up a bit of a test fixture for WSGI (<tt class="literal"><span class="pre">wsgikit.test_fixture</span></tt> -- which is kind of a dumping ground, but a lot of pieces will probably go away -- <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">fake_request</span></tt> is what I really used).  WSGI worked really well for testing, because I could test <em>only</em> <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">URLParser</span></tt>, by creating an &quot;incomplete&quot; stack that didn't include any other components.  I had to create little WSGI applications, but I wrote them as plainly as I could -- the app files don't even import anything.</p>
<p>I also started working on configuration (<tt class="literal"><span class="pre">wsgikit.pyconfig</span></tt> and <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">wsgikit.configmiddleware</span></tt>), though I haven't made use of it yet.  And I put together a startup script (<tt class="literal"><span class="pre">server.py</span></tt>) that makes it easy to run an app and load configuration.  And I put together the generic reloader (<tt class="literal"><span class="pre">wsgikit.reloader</span></tt>), for Webware-style reloading; <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">server.py</span></tt> actually handles the whole restart portion, so that there's no shell or batch files involved -- a minor point, but it's one less thing to think about.  I haven't tested it with twisted -- maybe twisted wouldn't like me killing it quite so crudely; probably <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">reloader</span></tt> should be extended with custom ways to terminate the process (though really the process should terminate fine so long as you use <a class="reference" href="http://docs.python.org/lib/module-atexit.html">atexit</a> properly).</p>
<p>Anyway, a lot more to talk about for Day 1, and my WSGIKit presentation, but that will wait for another post.</p>
