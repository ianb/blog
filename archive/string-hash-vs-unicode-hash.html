            <p>
                The strings are equal, but they don't hash equally, so the
                dictionary (being a hash table) puts both in and doesn't notice
                their equality. Not surprising; equality is default encoding
                aware (the byte string is decoded before comparing it with the
                unicode string). In fact you get
                <tt class="docutils literal"
                    ><span class="pre">UnicodeDecodeError</span></tt
                >
                if you compare a byte string that can't be decoded in the
                default encoding to a unicode string. (I know exactly why
                there's an exception there, and I understand why, and maybe I
                even see how it's a good idea, but how can you <em>not</em> find
                it disturbing that these two objects can't be safely compared
                when almost all other objects, no matter how different in type,
                can be compared?)
            </p>
            <p>
                Oh, but I was talking about hashes. Well, the hash algorithm for
                strings apparently isn't aware of default encodings. (Just in
                case this was specific to the
                <tt class="docutils literal"
                    ><span class="pre">reload(sys)</span></tt
                >
                hack, I also tested it with a change to
                <tt class="docutils literal"
                    ><span class="pre">site.py</span></tt
                >). Note that
                <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">hash</span></tt>
                does work for ASCII-encodable Unicode string (i.e.,
                <tt class="docutils literal"
                    ><span class="pre">hash('foo')</span>
                    <span class="pre">==</span>
                    <span class="pre">hash(u'foo')</span></tt

                <p>
                    Your first example is not odd and the behavior has hardly
                    anything to do with str and unicode.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It is a property of Python's dictionaries that if you set a
                    new key-value pair and the key is equal to an existing key,
                    then the value in the dictionary is changed but the old key
                    is not replaced with the new (equal) one. The last time I
                    asked about this I believe Tim Peters said it wasn't
                    intended to be part of the interface for dict, but that it
                    was a very reasonable implementation accident and that most
                    things implementing the mappable interface did the same.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The only thing that has anything to do with strings and
                    unicode is that &quot;test&quot; == u&quot;test&quot; -- I
                    find this a highly desirable property. With the default
                    encoding hash(&quot;test&quot;) == hash(u&quot;test&quot;)
                    also as it ought to.
                </p>
                <p>---</p>
                <p>
                    The bit about getting a UnicodeDecodeError when comparing
                    byte strings to unicode strings doesn't bother me much.
                    There are other incomparable things (complex numbers for
                    example, also classes that override __equals__) and these
                    rarely cause problems in practice. In the real world, no one
                    other than the garbage collecter goes around comparing
                    random things to each other, and the GC only cares about
                    object identity. This is a little worse because strings and
                    unicode strings often get mixed up together randomly, but
                    when that happens it is usually because we have a collection
                    of &quot;string things&quot; (not binary data) some of which
                    managed to fit into str and some of which had characters
                    outside the current encoding and thus wound up as unicode.
                    In such a situation the str objects would all be convertable
                    to unicode and the exception wouldn't occur.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If someone really needs to start doing random compares
                    between some uncategorized objects some of which are unicode
                    strings and others of which are str objects containing
                    BINARY data, then this person can just catch the
                    UnicodeDecodeError... it won't be the worst of their
                    problems.
                </p>
                <p>---</p>
                <p>
                    Finally, I think you're onto something when you point out
                    that after changing the default encoding &quot;xxx&quot; ==
                    u&quot;xxx&quot; for all xxx but hash(&quot;xxx&quot;) !=
                    hash(u&quot;xxx&quot;) for some xxx. I would say that's a
                    bug... equality should imply equal hashes, that's part of
                    the contract for hashing.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So should we fix it? I tend to think we should. The only
                    worry I have is that this means that the hash of a string or
                    unicode might need to depend on the string's content AND on
                    the current default encoding. That's OK if default encoding
                    can't change during the lifetime of a Python interpreter,
                    but a definite no no if default encoding can change. And as
                    you pointed out, it's HARD to change at runtime, but not
                    impossible.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Ian, all this talk about sys.setdefaultencoding() is really
                    not very productive: sys.setdefaultencoding() was added to
                    Python as part of a compromise in choosing a default
                    encoding and originates from a time when we considered using
                    the locale to determine the default encoding. It is not
                    supported and was only left in the language to allow
                    experiments (see the site.py module) - if you change the
                    default encoding in Python, you're on your own. Expect
                    problems with all kinds of things.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For the historical details, read up in the python-dev
                    archives of the year 2000 when Unicode support was added to
                    the language. A quick overview is included in a talk I gave
                    at the EuroPython conference in 2002:
                    <a

                    >
                </p>
                <p>
                    On the subject: we took great care to make sure that ASCII
                    Unicode gives the same hash value as an ASCII string. This
                    does not extend to non-ASCII characters, regardless of the
                    default encoding.
