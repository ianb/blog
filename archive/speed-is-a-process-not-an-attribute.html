        <blockquote><i>or: Python vs. C Extensions</i></blockquote>

        <p>
            Any reader of the Python list/group (<a href="news:comp.lang.python"
                ><tt>comp.lang.python</tt></a
            >) will have become used to the &quot;Is Python Right For Me?&quot;
            queries, typically with a question about performance. The typical
            answer is that if Python's performance is problematic, you can code
            key portions in C -- at an extreme, Python can be a scripting
            language for your C (or C++, or now even
            <a href="http://pyobjc.sourceforge.net/">Objective C</a>)
            application.
        </p>

        <p>
            I don't think this is a very good answer, because it's not the
            answer that most Python programmers come to. Extension programming
            is a sort of release valve -- it means there's always a way out if
            you need it. Python can never be worse than C, because you can
            always rewrite more and more of your code in C until your
            application performs sufficiently. But it really is a release valve,
            and like a release valve it's only there in case of emergency.
        </p>

        <p>
            I think the real answer to these people should be: Python is fast
            enough just as it is. Your application may not be fast enough when
            you first write it in Python, but you can almost always make Python
            -- <i>just</i> Python -- perform sufficiently. This isn't true for
            every domain, but it's true for the most common programs.
        </p>

        <p>
            C is good for one kind of performance -- running code really fast.
            But this is only one kind of performance, and now that CPUs are so
            fast it's not the most important kind of performance. Programs have
            bottlenecks, and nothing but the bottleneck matters. CPUs are not
            the bottleneck!
        </p>

        <p>
            Two applications that reminded me of this: Evolution and Mail.app.
            At least for my usage, Mail.app runs <i>much</i> faster than
            Evolution (and Sylpheed and any other mail reader I've tried). This
            isn't because of language or runtime differences. Mail.app runs
            faster because it is smarter. I have big IMAP mailboxes, and
            Mail.app caches messages intelligently, checks those caches
            intelligently, and does its best to queue IMAP queries for quick
            response to what I'm most interested in.
        </p>

        <p>
            Mail.app isn't written in Python, but it shows what good
            optimization is -- it's not just executing code fast, it's executing
            only as much code as necessary, and being responsive.
        </p>

        <p>
            So, I think when someone asks if Python performance is an issue,
            tell them <i>no</i>, and don't apologize for Python by pointing to
            the release valve of C extensions. If you can write a full-featured
            Python program twice as fast as C (probably more like 10x, but for
            argument...), that leaves the Python programmer a lot of time to
            think about how to make the program more responsive. Some of that
            time spent in optimization could be used to mitigate Python's
            relatively slow computation, but more likely it will be spent
            avoiding expensive operations with disks and networks. In the end, I
            would expect the pure Python program to be <i>faster</i> than the C
            program (given an equal amount of programmer time).

            <br />
            Another way to look at it: I'd expect the Python program to work
            successfully and the C program to be about 5-10% finished. After
            all, time-to-market counts for more than anything else in a
            software-for-sale or consulting-by-the-hour job.

            In my limited experience, the people who obsess about performance
            and therefore only wrote things in C/C++ have been the ones who were
            most likely to write bad and inefficient C/C++ code. Usually most of
            their bad coding was done in the name of up-front optimization.
            <br />

            <br />
            For example, they would decide to use a 3MB two-D array of structs
            because "it would be faster than using STL containers and classes."
            It didn't matter to them that their data could be represented in
            other ways (even in plain C) that would be faster and more memory
            efficient, and it didn't matter that it might be easier to code if
            you let a library juggle some of the details for you. I think the
            real issue was that they didn't know how to do anything other than
            use two for-loops to iterate over a static array. And I guess that's
            my point - these arguments usually get made because someone is
            slightly ignorant of their "favorite fast language" and completely
            ignorant of what you gain by using a higher level language.
            <br />

            <br />
            This is just my experience; I'm not extrapolating it to say all
            performance-minded arguments are motivated by ignorance. There are
            cases where C/C++ might be necessary, but I think they are few and
            far between.

            It does seem like optimizing the python code would be a better
            <br />
            approach, but is there a comprehensive document somewhere that
            <br />
            describes how one can best optimize their python code? A
            <br />
            tutorial or something would be a big help. If you could just
            <br />
            give python newbies a link to that page, that would go a long
            <br />
            way toward helping out.

            can give some wonderful speedups with just two line of codes
            inserted at the begining of your module. It only works on i386 arch
            for now though.
            <br />

            <br />
            Now to answer your question more precisely, there is no such
            document, though
            <a
                href="http://www.python.org/doc/essays/list2str.html"
                target="_blank"
                >http://www.python.org/doc/essays/list2str.html</a
            >
            is one of the references on the topic.
            <a
                href="http://trific.ath.cx/resources/python/optimization/"
                target="_blank"
                >http://trific.ath.cx/resources/python/optimization/</a
            >
            is also a nice one (and they both come on the first page when
            googling for "python optimization"). The key thing is that you
            should never ever optimize blindly. Learn how to use the profiler
            module to find the bottleneck of your application and this is the
            only place where you should ever optimize. Make your code work in
            the first place. Make it clean. Make it readable. Then and not
            before, find the bottleneck (if any) .
