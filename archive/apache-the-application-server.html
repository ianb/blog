        <h1>Apache the Application Server</h1>
        <p>
            At work I've been developing a
            <a href="http://blog.colorstudy.com/ianb/weblog/2003/12/12.html#P45"
                >static publishing</a
            >
            CMS. This has worked well, but it's made me think differently about
            application development. Previously I'd deal with any issues inside
            the specific programming environment I was using, separate from
            Apache. These environments (Webware, Zope, PHP) are controllable and
            relatively well partitioned, and I generally have a lot of control.
            But these environments don't interact that well when they come
            together to make one site. One piece is in Zope, another as a Perl
            CGI script, another as PHP, and now the addition of static content
            from the CMS.
        </p>

        <p>
            One solution is a homogeneous environment, e.g., use Zope for
            absolutely everything. But that's really not realistic, there's a
            lot of useful tools that aren't in Zope (or PHP, or Perl, or...) and
            converting every application isn't worth it. The one thing they all
            have in common is Apache, and I'm hoping to use that.
        </p>

        <p>
            The first thing I've been experimenting with is authentication.
            Apache doesn't do authentication very well. It mostly expects HTTP
            authentication. HTTP authentication sucks. A lot. You can't provide
            any UI -- the login popup can't have messages or links, and
            expecting the user to cancel and then notice links on the error page
            is optimistic. There's no logout. A page either has to require
            login, or else no login is allowed -- you can't get user information
            unless you reject anonymous users. You can't do cross-site logins,
            even if you try really really hard (it's not easy with cookies, but
            at least it's possible). HTTP authentication just sucks. And since
            it is orthogonal to everything else, there's absolutely no way to
            fix it, it's all up to the browsers and the browsers aren't even
            bothering to try.
        </p>

        <p>
            My first experiment has been to use mod_python to allow cookie
            authentication. Mostly this has meant trying lots of things that
            don't work in order to find one that does. I'll write more about
            that later, but in the end I was able to get it to work. Rather than
            centralizing authentication, I think it will be easier to simply use
            a signed cookie to indicate that authentication has occurred. This
            way Apache doesn't have to know about every authentication backend I
            might want to use.
        </p>

        <p>
            The second feature I'm looking forward to is Apache 2's
            <a href="http://httpd.apache.org/docs-2.0/filter.html">filters</a>.
            Particularly for templating, probably using
            <a href="http://httpd.apache.org/docs-2.0/mod/mod_include.html"
                >mod_include</a
            >
            (server-side includes). Any resource (static files, CGI scripts,
            etc.) can output SSI tags and they will be interpreted. This should
            make a site look much easier to implement, and will remove one of
            the biggest barriers to a heterogeneous site. It also makes it
            possible to compose a page from heterogeneous sources, as SSIs can
            in turn include any local URL.
        </p>

            Hi, Ian!
            <br />

            <br />
            I built a CMS using mod_python a couple of years ago. It's currently
            hosting two sites: phoenixchildrenshospital.com and
            turntableband.com.
            <br />

            <br />
            I ended up taking the lazy road and using Basic Auth, but I have
            pretty much the same opinion as you. It sucks. It's horribly
            limited, and implementing "logout" is arguably impossible (Zope
            seems to pull it off, sorta, kinda).
            <br />

            <br />
            So, you've got some setup to do before mod_python is ready for a
            CMS, mainly session managemet, authentication, templating, and
            database interfaces, but once you get past that, mod_python is a
            total joy to program in. So simple! It does exactly what it's
            supposed to do; no more, no less.
            <br />

            <br />
            I especially love the "publisher" module, since it lets me
            completely close the gap between URLs and function calls.
            <br />

            <br />
            I haven't tried Webware, but I've heard great things about it. I was
            initially very impressed with Zope, but my main beef with it is that
            it tries to appease content editors and programmers through the same
            interface, and as a result, feels very crippled. Am I supposed to
            write my code in Zope, or on the file system? If I write inside of
            Zope, I have to expose system functionality through external methods
            or products, and it's so constrained and filtered that I barely feel
            like I'm using Python anymore. mod_python let me just write Python,
            with the added convenience that I can make a page just as easily as
            I can make a function.
            <br />

            <br />
            Good luck with your project.
            <br />
            Dave
