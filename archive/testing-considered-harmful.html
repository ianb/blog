        <h1>Testing considered harmful</h1>
        Maybe Dijkstra isn't going that far, but it's an interesting argument
        against testing. He would certainly have bristled at the notion that
        "once your tests pass your code is done," even if tests still serve a
        certain purpose. Sometimes I feel I should reread my software more
        often. If it's not worth rereading, then it's too long and should be
        cut. If it is too good to need refinement, then reading it will simply
        make me feel happy even if I don't change it. But by rereading, I may
        feel more certain of the correctness of the program, as well as the
        conceptual integrity. Unit tests are good, but unit tests do not make
        code *beautiful*. Another interesting point he makes: programs are not
        correct, computations are correct. That is, it is the *running* of the
        program that must be correct, in the fullness of its environment within
        and beyond the computer it runs on. Indeed, this is why I believe the
        Turing Machine is not applicable to real programming, because no useful
        programs can be reduced to a Turing Machine. Useful programs are useful
        only because they produce useful computations, and without I/O a Turing
        Machine is fundamentally unable to be useful.

            <br />
            I completely agree, but this misses a common approach to the use of
            unit tests. Kent Beck advocates a cycle for any given test that
            positively does *not* say that you are done when your tests pass: in
            fact you're only past the second phase. He recommends that (1) you
            write a failing test, (2) you get the test to pass and then,
            crucially, (3) you refactor. (I think Kent Beck characterises it as
            'remove duplication'.)
            <br />

            <br />
            (3) can take much longer than (1) and (2) put together, not least
            because this stage can end up with rewriting quite a lot of code not
            related to the test if opportunities for improved structure emerge.
            This is the opportunity to make the code beautiful. The unit test
            gives you a better chance of not breaking the code during this
            process.
