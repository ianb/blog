                >; quoting a bit:

                    But oh, how quick are we to forget Python's smashing
                    successes in the Web world. We've got Plone, probably the
                    most popular and comprehensive CMS out there. We've got the
                    platform its built on, Zope, which is (from what I hear)
                    fairly popular, too. We've had PyBloxsom, which until
                    WordPress came along was a very widespread blogging system.
                    And hell, we've got Python's &quot;killer&quot; web app,
                    Trac, which just about everyone is using these days. And oh,
                    BitTorrent. I know it's not a Web application in the
                    traditional server-side sense, but it just shows how capable
                    Python truly is.
                </p>
                <p>
                    What do all of these applications have in common? They
                    certainly don't share a web framework; most of them are
                    developed specific to that application and tailored to
                    various deployment platforms (CGI, FastCGI, custom server,
                    mod_python). Python appears to be falling behind in the
                    world of custom-made Web applications, but in the world of
                    generic, reusable Web applications, Python is doing great.

                I wouldn't necessarily throw in the towel for frameworks, but I
                think Peter's right to bring the focus back to apps. A good
                environment (language, framework, design methodology, whatever)
                is good when people build great applications using it. And
                that's all there is to it. Obviously we have imagination and
                choice and we can have forward vision, but these are just
                <em>aspirations</em>; you still have to deliver the application
                before it really matters. And there's a lot of good applications
                written in Python, so we have nothing to apologize for.
            </p>
            <p>
                Interestingly, by this metric, PHP is a really great language.
                Also by this metric PHP is a really horrible language. PHP is
                funny that way. What PHP gets really right is that it invites
                participation, a PHP app is generally approachable. PHP has had
                a good feedback cycle: good applications exist, starting of the
                cycle; then it comes back because people regularly tweak and
                modify the applications they install.
            </p>
            <p>
                A lot of the features in my
                <a class="reference" href="ideal-webdev-environment.html"
                    >incomplete list of web environment features</a
                >
                are about making an application inviting for people other than
                the original developer. These may be people who installed it,
                people who are tweaking it, or coworkers who come in at
                different points in its development. The motivation is bringing
                the feedback cycle back around; so that once we put applications
                out there we get people (even if very indirectly) coming back
                around as participants. And, of course, inviting participation
                without losing good development practices, which are
                &quot;good&quot; for reasons that apply just as much if not
                moreso to those late-joiners.
            </p>
            <p>
                But of course, the feedback cycle starts with great
                applications. So lets go write applications. If there's lots yet
                to do in frameworks, there is a near-infinite amount left to do
                in applications.

                    I'm concerned that the apps tend to hide Python. Yes, the
                    apps are popular but couldn't the same apps be re-written in
                    Ruby? And with the surge in Ruby popularity there are plenty
                    of Ruby developers who can/will give it a try.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I think it's a stretch to equate Zope &amp; Plone popularity
                    with Python. My fear is that to use this spin to soothe the
                    egos of Python developers is worse than throwing in the
                    towel or turning off the lights. You've just gouged out your
                    eyes. And possibly setback Python's hope to go mainstream by
                    about five years.

                        This is part of why I think it's important, having
                        created applications other people want to use, that we
                        create a situation where they are encouraged to extend
                        and expand upon those applications. An environment of
                        complimentary applications, plugins, and general
                        customizing experience cannot be easily duplicated. So
                        while a nice encapsulated zip file has a certain appeal,
                        I also want people to feel they can jump into the code
                        without destroying the application or getting themselves
                        in trouble in the future.

                            I'm starting to give up the goal of a mainstream
                            Python.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Yesterday I needed a way to reach out from a Python
                            program and respond to a Windows GUI prompt for a
                            password. A prompt that I had not expected when
                            writing the app. Panic time!
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I Googled for help and found the watsup module. Wow,
                            what a clean, well designed and documented package.
                            Built on top of other similarly impressive Python
                            packages. I'm grateful for the help, excited to have
                            so much power available to me and anxious to show
                            off this stuff to other programmers. I already liked
                            Python. But this is an additional layer of
                            appreciation. And, although purely as a side note, a
                            good example of the value of a high quality
                            framework.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            My real point is that the big win for Python is not
                            the watsup package but that Python, well designed or
                            not, attracted the creator(s) of watsup. I see
                            Python as a filter that only certain people can get
                            past. If scope by indent and crippled threads keep
                            certain people (most Java programmers) away and let
                            the watsup creator pass though, then... maybe that's
                            best.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Maybe the developers who have told me it's better to
                            do it right than be popular are correct. I'll try to
                            find peace with that thought. And be happy to have
                            made it past the filter myself.

                    This actually seems very logical to me. When you look at
                    pythons batteries included approach, all the tools are there
                    for writing these custom apps with no outside libraries.
                    This seems highly desireable given that these apps for the
                    most part will have to be hosted on a platform which only
                    has python installed, and the user doesn't have control over
                    what they can install on these machines. Urllib alone is
                    more than adequate for generating http headers and
                    responses. I don't blame the fact that we don't have killer
                    frameworks, just with all the dependencies most require,
                    basically anything beyond python greatly reduces their
                    usability. Though one thing that did catch my attention
                    quite a bit, is the new demo over at twistedmatrix of their
                    web 2, the one file has several deployment options built in.
                    Also I believe that when most python programmers go to
                    tackle the web, have a hard time thinking past the
                    application and we want our applications to be very usable
                    by as many people as possible.
