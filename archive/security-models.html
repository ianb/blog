        <h1>Security Models</h1>
        <p>
            I've been thinking about security models lately, as I'm presented
            with creating one for a CMS I've been working on. But I don't feel
            like I have a lot of good models to work off of.
        </p>

        <p>
            The traditional Unix model has some positive points. Quick review:
            each object has an owner and a group owner, and you can set
            permissions for the owner, any member of the group, and everyone
            else. The positive is that this system is easy to implement, easy to
            understand, and easy to audit. It's very concrete, and it can be
            presented quite succinctly in the output of <tt>ls -l</tt>.
        </p>

        <p>
            But there's lots of negatives too. It's obviously not very flexible
            -- just one owner, and one group owner. But there's also lots of
            other confusions. How does the container (directory) relate to the
            object (file)? What permissions do new objects get? There's several
            things that interact here -- sticky bits, imask, and probably other
            things I'm not even aware of. And in the end this still isn't
            expressive enough -- ownership and permission is frequently messed
            up (at least where users are involved).
        </p>

        <p>
            An alternative is Access Control Lists (ACLs). These are pretty much
            like traditional Unix permissions, only where's there's just one
            owner and group there, you can have lists of them with ACLs. This
            can get you out of some binds, but does it really help things that
            much? Where Unix permissions can be unnecessarily eclectic, at least
            they are easy to review -- ACLs are dense and prone to organic
            growth. They are difficult to audit, and it is difficult to really
            have a sense of the overall permissions for a system -- you only can
            know the permissions for one file at a time.
        </p>

        <p>
            And just like Unix permissions, it's hard to understand future
            objects. Where do new files' permissions come from? The container,
            the creating user, the file type, the creating software? And how do
            you change that policy?
        </p>

        <p>
            Neither system is very useful when translated to a more general
            system like a CMS. Filesystems are easy, at least, because the set
            of operations is so small -- you create, read, and write. The set of
            permissions for a folder in a Zope instance has 88 different
            actions, times how ever many roles you have, with the option of
            inheriting from the container (so you have to look through a bunch
            of different screens to figure out what the actual permissions for
            one location is). This is not a setup that encourages good security
            -- it's essentially an ACL, except where only groups are assigned
            permissions, never individual users. (But at least the permissions
            of new objects are easy to ascertain, as they are all dynamically
            inherited)
        </p>

        <p>
            I think object-oriented permission schemes are much better. By
            object-oriented I mean: expressed with code, not data. You don't
            have data about objects, you ask objects about themselves; you don't
            do things with objects, you ask objects to do things for themselves.
            It's all much more ad hoc as a result, and likely requires real
            programming to make changes to the system. But I would say that a
            few lines of code are superior to a big table of values -- the
            heterogeneous structures we create on demand are more expressive and
            less prone to bugs than are larger, more general homogeneous data
            structures. I can express the typical Zope security table with only
            a couple lines of (pseudo-) code:
        </p>

        <pre>
class ...
    def permitted(self, user, action):
        return self.container.permitted(user, action)
</pre
        >

        I.e., acquire all permissions from your container. When using these kind
        of dynamic permissions, it's possible to be so much more expressive,
        because you have access to the eclectic data that is relevant to each
        object. For instance, you might allow a user to modify, in a limited
        manner, documents that point to a document which they have control over.
        Or you can introduce explicit delegation of permissions in certain
        contexts. For any domain there's a large number of potential, specific
        rules that might govern permissions.

        <p>
            Unfortunately, having chosen this ad hoc route, you've given
            yourself so many degrees of freedom that it's hard to figure out
            which way to go. Sure, that <tt>permitted</tt> function seemed easy
            enough. But a real system needs to know more than that -- for an
            action, what are the users that can perform it? For a user and
            action, what are the objects for which they are permitted? And (for
            symmetry) for a user and object, what actions are permitted? How do
            you present an interface for changing particulars of the
            permissions? As you change those functions, how do you update
            objects, how do you delegate responsibility between objects? These
            are all typical programming questions, and their solutions are even
            that particular to security, but they are also questions that are
            often answered incorrectly and refactoring permissions can seem as
            daunting as writing them in the first place. It seems like there's
            not enough precedent to serve as a guide, there's not enough
            examples of transparent yet powerful and flexible systems.
        </p>

        <p>
            While I don't know the underlying code, I suspect Zope is as general
            as what I've described. But presented with this freedom, most
            programmers of subsystems for Zope have simply used the tabular
            system that seems so straight forward, if not elegant. It's easier
            to build an ACL instead of finding something domain-specific.
        </p>

        <p>
            Are there systems out there worth inspection and immitation? Please
            tell, be they databases, filesystems, client/server applications,
            web applications, or anything else.

        <blockquote>
            What you are looking for are described in the literature as
            "capabilities." Think of them as ACLs with real meaning. There is a
            Java variant called
            <a href="https://ianbicking.org/www.e-lang.org" target="_blank"
                >E</a
            >
            that was developed by a company I used to work for (before the
            company blew up the lang was open-sourced) which was a
            capability-secure version of Java. One of the members of the E inner
            circle is Ka-Ping Yee (author of various PEPs) and his continued
            involvement with E gives me hope that one day it might make its way
            into Python is some shape, perhaps as a replacement for the recently
            nuked "safe" execution modules.
            <br />
            One thing that the E folks have done a lot of work on is dealing
            with UI issues and programming issues related to capabilities and
            the first few steps toward making this whole process a bit easier
            for the programmer. Be warned though, this group has been talking
            about this stuff for many years and has its own internal language to
            describe programming structures and processes that seems a bit
            opaque until you actually get your mind wrapped around the
            capability paradigm.

            Ian,
            <br />

            <br />
            I'm curious - is this CMS you're developing based on Webware (or
            you're simplified version of Webware)? Is it for work/fun/both?

            It's actually written in Zope, which is what I've been doing a lot
            of my professional work in lately.

            Jim: There was a good, ad-hoc roundtable discussion at PyCon DC 2003
            about capabilities, in which Ka-Ping Yee participated (drove, really
            :-) ) to help get other people up to speed on the basic notions. I
            think your hopes about seeing capabilities in Python are definitely
            justified.
            <br />

            <br />
            A google search for "python capabilities" yields several meaty
            threads from python-dev and the like, as well.
            <br />

            <br />
            Ian: To follow up on Jim's comments, capabilities are a very
            powerful mechanism for managing access to resources (whether the
            resources are objects, methods, what have you). It's not clear that
            you can make them <i>completely</i> safe within Python right now if
            you allow arbitrary code execution (hence the removal of the
            restricted execution tools), but if you're controlling the code side
            of things, and you're mainly looking for internal mechanisms of
            managing access, take a look.
            <br />

            notes and background papers on capabilities-based security there.

            there are also novell's trustees which offer another interesting
            approach on filesystem security. there's a patch for linux which
            allows you to use trustee style security rules. the url is
            <a href="http://trustees.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank"
                >http://trustees.sourceforge.net/</a
            >
            <br />

            <br />
            the patch is a little bit outdated, but applies well to newer kernel
            versions (except of some parts which need to be merged manually).
