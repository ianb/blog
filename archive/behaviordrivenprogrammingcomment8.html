        <p>
            I think you hit the nail on the head there. I've messed around with
            both TDD and BDD in Ruby, and, as you'd expect, neither seems to do
            anything that the other can't do.
        </p>

        <p>
            BDD just uses different language in an attempt to encourage good
            testing practices. It's the kind of thing that's easy to downplay,
            but of course the only difference between any two general
            programming languages are the things that their syntaxes encourage
            and discourage.
