            An intriguing article:

        <blockquote>
            ... Here comes the first key point:

            <blockquote>
                First, it's assumed that the actual end systems that the
                protocol is being executed on are secure....
            </blockquote>

            (And then some testing of that claim. To round this out, let's skip
            to the next paragraph:)

            <blockquote>
                ... we assume that the attacker has more or less complete
                control of the communications channel between any two machines.
            </blockquote>

            Ladies and Gentlemen, there you have it. The Internet Threat Model
            (ITM), in a nutshell, or, two nutshells, if we are using those
            earlier two sentance models. It's a strong model: the end nodes are
            secure and the middle is not. It's clean, it's simple, and we just
            happen to have a solution for it. Problem is, it's also wrong. The
            end systems are not secure, and the comms in the middle is actually
            remarkably safe.
        </blockquote>

        Then later:

        <blockquote>
            A threat model looks at the application - at what we are trying to
            protect. In this case, we know that the actual threat that SSL was
            built for was the sniffer of credit card numbers. But, he, the
            sniffer, is not considered, what's replaced his role is some
            theoretical bogey man. The bogey man can do anything that we know
            how to protect against, and not the things we can't protect against.
        </blockquote>

        Unfortunately, it doesn't suggest what the Internet Threat Model
        <i>should</i> be, but that's a more complex topic. I have a feeling it
        would involve much more psychology and less math.

            Been doing a little too much COM programming lately by any chance?

            Oops, corrected. Never actually done any COM programming, but thread
            does just roll off the fingers.

            Talking about phishing attacks, I recall a newspaper article about
            criminals in an European country installing fake ATM machines and
            reads off the magnetic stripes on the bank cards.

                        HEH! That was the albanian mafia in Greece! If anyone's
                        interested I have scanned several newspaper articles
