        <h1>More on decorators</h1>
        <p>
            After reading through the
            <a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.python.devel/61569"
                >thread</a
            >
            on Python-Dev about the new @decorator syntax, it seems like Guido's
            mind is set, if only from being exhausted by the discussion (14
            months of discussion, it seems). This syntax will go out in 2.4a2,
            though until 2.4rc1 goes out, I'm guessing it's not set in stone.
        </p>

        <p>
            One thought that occurred to me concerning
            <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/jcalderone/3913.html"
                >JP Calderone's</a
            >
            suggestion, and one which is very similar to
            <a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.python.devel/61608"
                >Phillip Eby's</a
            >
            suggestion, is that they don't <i>need</i> to be hacks. Well, they
            need to be hacks now, just like <tt>implements()</tt> and
            <tt>advise()</tt> are hacks now.
        </p>

        <p>
            So here's another suggestion. <tt>decorate()</tt> and friends (I
            like "decorate" much more than Phillip's terse "as") return a
            specific kind of object. This object is identified by a special
            attribute, like <tt>__metaconstructor__</tt>. There is precedence in
            <a href="http://users.rcn.com/python/download/Descriptor.htm"
                >descriptors</a
            >, which are identified by special attributes (<tt>__get__</tt> and
            <tt>__set__</tt>).
        </p>

        <p>
            Whenever such an object shows up at the top level in a class, it is
            given access to the class. When, how, or where I'm not sure. In the
            case of decorators, it needs more access than the standard metaclass
            mechanism provides, since it needs to know what function was defined
            after it. In other cases, like interfaces, it would probably be
            sufficient for the object to work on the constructed class.
        </p>

        <p>
            The result is something that isn't a hack, and opens up a lot of
            other possibilities, decorators being just one. Too many
            possibilities? Maybe. Too hard to notice? I actually think this
            isn't a problem, because the expressions don't make sense in a class
            statement except in this case. For instance:
        </p>

        <pre>
class Foo(object):
    implements(IFoo)
</pre
        >

        Until people started these frame hacks there were never any statements
        in a class definition that looked like <tt>implements(IFoo)</tt>. The
        only reason you'd want to do this is if you wanted the class scope to be
        available in the expression list, which is an uncommon requirement. Why
        run something, throw away the value, and execute the whole thing in the
        scope of a class that does not yet exist? Which is to say, I think these
        statements are distinctive.

        <p>
            Much like <tt>classmethod</tt> isn't syntax (it's just a useful
            builtin), maybe we don't need more syntax here either.
        </p>

            @something is ugly and unpythonic imho. Don't know if anybody has
            mentioned it, but I'd go with the Decorator-Block syntax, easy to
            spot, easy to read, and saves lot of typing.
            <br />

            <br />
            decorator require_int:
            <br />
            def foo( a, b ): pass
            <br />
            def bar( a, b ): pass

            Would you care to guess how many emails have been exchanged on this
            topic? Thousands, easily. What we emphatically do not need at this
            point are more "what about this syntax?" ideas...

            If all that debate didn't lead anywhere, then maybe the question
            itself was incorrectly formed.

            For such a corner-case feature, the amount of energy wasted on this
            topic is immeasurable. Let's fix hasattr to not mask all errors
            instead... or get a nicer process module (PEP 324) or *anything*
            else but argue about syntax of a language feature that only 1% of
            Python users are going to want to ever know about.
