                I looked at

                    >LocalFS</a
                >. FSView certainly feels cleaner, but I'm not 100% sure...
                here's my initial thoughts:
            </p>
            <ul class="simple">
                <li>
                    FileSystemView doesn't seem to allow editing through the
                    web. Well, not a big deal since I'm trying to escape that
                    model anyway; except that I can't cut and paste things from
                    the ZODB, which I'd like to do to migrate old code. Maybe
                    <a
                        class="reference"
                        href="http://zope.org/Members/tseaver/FSDump/view"
                        >FSDump</a
                    >
                    can be used for that end of the process.
                </li>
                <li>
                    FileSystemView hides all extensions, and LocalFS shows all
                    extensions. This is nice, since it means you can control
                    your objects' names (very important for legacy projects, but
                    even important for new projects). I hacked something into
                    LocalFS to hide some extensions, but it makes things act
                    weird, since it doesn't <em>always</em> hide extensions. I
                    assume when I do use extensions in a FileSystemView object
                    (e.g., I usually add
                    <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">.pt</span></tt> to the
                    templates to distinguish them from their accompanying Python
                    Script), I can just double up the extensions (<tt
                        class="literal"
                        ><span class="pre">filename.pt.pt</span></tt
                    >) -- a little ugly, but it doesn't really bother me.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Files that FileSystemView doesn't understand just don't get
                    shown. LocalFS tries to serve them anyway, usually as static
                    files. I'm indifferent, though I dislike the
                    <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">.svn/</span></tt>
                    directories being shown (FSView respects a leading
                    <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">.</span></tt> as a
                    hidden file). Hacking LocalFS to do this would be easy.
                </li>
                <li>
                    FileSystemView has a more strict idea of where files should
                    go. In particular, they have to go in the
                    <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">Products</span></tt>
                    directory. That's kind of annoying; LocalFS lets you attach
                    any directory you want.
                </li>
                <li>
                    FileSystemView has properties -- objects that just hold
                    attributes. That's kind of nice, though typically I use
                    properties for things that are really installation-specific
                    (i.e., configuration), so I don't know if I want them in the
                    filesystem (or at least repository) anyway.
                </li>
                <li>
                    FileSystemView has some notion of &quot;customization&quot;
                    -- it will copy the object to another location on disk, and
                    then allow it to be edited...? This seems interesting --
                    e.g., you could customize templates and other items on a
                    per-installation basis. Maybe? But the
                    <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">README.txt</span></tt>
                    doesn't mention anything about it, and I just get an empty
                    <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">select</span></tt>
                    box, so it's not functional by default. I'm guessing this a
                    remnant of
                    <a
                        class="reference"
                        href="http://zope.org/Products/CMF/index.html"
                        >CMF</a
                    >
                    which might make sense to me if I knew anything about CMF.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                My conclusion: unless I'm missing something, it's mostly a wash
                (at least given the development I've already done on LocalFS).
                FileSystemView may have more of a future; it's not even clear
                who is developing LocalFS at this point (though I assume the
                <a
                    class="reference"
                    href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/localfs"
                    >SF project</a
                >
                is defunct). FSView avoids some of LocalFS's complications by
                being read-only; of course, filesystem permissions can make
                LocalFS thoroughly read-only too, avoiding some potential
                problems. FSView's policy of looking in
                <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">Products</span></tt>
                annoys me -- it might make sense in the context of CMF or some
                other system or company, but it makes it more difficult to adapt
                to our local conventions. I dislike putting policy into code;
                internally to an organization it's probably good, but for public
                code it's a burden.

                There was also a

                    href="https://ianbicking.org/zope-to-localfs-comment-2.html"

                to use
                <a class="reference" href="http://hathawaymix.org/Software/Ape"
                    >APE</a
                >. APE is a much larger project, but also seems to be pretty
                actively developed. In the past it didn't seem that compelling
                to move stuff out of the ZODB and into a database or filesystem
                if the objects were still opaque. But apparently it has custom
                mappings for some types (probably all the types I'm interested
                in), which would presumably make the files pretty transparent.
            </p>
            <p>
                Unfortunately APE requires Zope 2.7, and we're using Zope 2.6
                here. There's more and more reasons we need to upgrade to 2.7...
                but anyway, both LocalFS and FileSystemView work fine with 2.6,
                and I don't want to delay this by adding another task to the mix
                -- I'd rather switch products later than delay moving code into
                the filesystem/repository. Ideally the product will allow the
                logical placement of code on the filesystem, so that moving to a
                different product won't be too complicated.
            </p>
            <p>
                Then, just now, I get a
                <a
                    class="reference"
                    href="https://ianbicking.org/zope-to-localfs-comment-4.html"
                    >suggestion</a
                >
                for
                <a
                    class="reference"
                    href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/zfolder2product"
                    >zfolder2product</a
                >. This also requires Zope 2.7, and seems to dump ZODB objects
                to the filesystem, then allow you to put them back into the ZODB
                from those files -- the object that recreates those ZODB objects
                is the &quot;product&quot; you create. I suspect the
                synchronization is less transparent than LocalFS or FSView
                (which are basically live views of the filesystem), but I'm not
                able to try it yet.
            </p>
            <p>
                Actually, the one thing I'm worried about is security, something
                that has always made me uncomfortable in Zope (part of the
                nature of its pervasive object publishing metaphor). FSView
                doesn't allow permissions to be set at all (below the root
                folder), and LocalFS does but it lies -- it forgets all
                settings. This might be something to I can hack onto LocalFS,
                but it makes me uncomfortable, and my initial experiments have
                been painful (I blame Acquisition once again... blast you
                Acquisition, you are my nemesis!)
            </p>
            <p>
                I suspect APE supports security restrictions and all those other
                possible annotations well, and zfolder2product can probably
                support it with a little work because of its imperative nature
                (you could just add another task to the end of the
                ZODB-object-creation step that fixes up the permissions).

                <p>
                    APE saves everything - permissions, properties, source, etc,
                    since it is a ZODB storage layer and not some magic folder
                    or object that reads and writes things it knows to the file
                    system. So everything gets saved. When it serializes an
                    object, it goes through a chain of objects that can store
                    different pieces of it, and an event tracks what persistent
                    attributes have been dealt with. So something with
                    properties uses the properties serializer which writes the
                    properties to a file (or RDBMS table, etc) in a usable
                    format, and marks those attributes as having been dealt
                    with. Then the next serializer might be the one responsible
                    for storing permission settings (since those are also
                    persistent attributes). The next might serialize the text
                    source (Python Script, ZPT Page, etc) or binary source
                    (file, image), etc. If after all of these serializers have
                    been used and there are still persistent attributes
                    remaining that haven't been stored or marked as used yet,
                    those get written out in a pickled format. Changes made on
                    the file system, or new files added in the file system, get
                    picked up immediately. And because it's a ZODB storage,
                    nothing changes in how you interact with the object in the
                    ZMI.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My terminology and specifics about how it works may not be
                    100% correct, but that's my understanding of how it worked
                    as of Ape 0.7. Since 0.7, the design has actually been
                    simplified.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Ape 0.7 worked with Zope 2.6, and I think I still have a
                    copy of it. Or maybe it was Ape 0.6. If you're interested,
                    I've put those old copies online at
                    <a class="reference" href="http://toulouse.amber.org/share/"
                        >toulouse.share</a
                    >.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If I recall correctly, things did get a little funny when
                    CVS was installed (basically because all of the CVS
                    directories and their contents show up in Zope). But it
                    worked really really well for dumping a site to the file
                    system, editing it on the file system, and then even copying
                    it back into a regular FileStorage based area of the ZODB -
                    it did it all transparently, and nothing was lost.

                        That seems pretty workable. You have to edit a
                        configuration file to make new directories available, so
                        it can't be done purely through the ZMI (and I suspect
                        requires a server restart).

                        It looks like a pretty good basis for putting legacy
                        ZODB code into a repository, without having to mess with
                        the code (which would make us unwittingly turn legacy
                        code into current code, which is what we're trying to
                        avoid ;)
