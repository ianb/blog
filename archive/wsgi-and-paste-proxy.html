                <a class="reference" href="http://topp.openplans.org">TOPP</a>
                we've been working on
                <a
                    class="reference"
                    href="http://openplans.org/projects/deliverance"

                to apply page styles through filtering (very similar in spirit
                to XSLT-based templating). I'll talk more about that later -- I
                think it's a really neat project that will let us offer hosted
                services to activists that look just like native services, while
                also letting us integrate all our natively hosted apps
                regardless of platform.
            </p>
            <p>
                When we started working with the project it used mod_python for
                doing the filtering. This was hard to setup and hard to test, so
                we abstracted it out some and I hacked together an
                <a
                    class="reference"
                    href="http://codespeak.net/svn/z3/deliverance/branches/packaged/deliverance/wsgifilter.py"
                    >implementation</a
                >
                using WSGI middleware.
            </p>
            <p>
                Then we were trying to figure out how to deploy it. We've worked
                some on
                <a
                    class="reference"
                    href="https://svn.openplans.org/svn/topp.zwsgi/trunk/topp/zwsgi/zopeapp.py"
                    >making Zope 2 a WSGI app</a
                >, but I wasn't that confident in using that in production yet,
                and anyway I wanted to use this <em>now</em>, on the live site,
                instead of waiting, so we can use this for real internally
                before we expose it externally. And we want other people to use
                this stuff too, and if deployment is hard it's a real drag on
                participation.
            </p>
            <p>
                At that point it occurred to me that an HTTP proxy would be very
                useful. And then I realized I already had all the tools I
                needed, I just needed to
                <a
                    class="reference"

                    >plug them together</a
                >
                and
                <a
                    class="reference"
                    href="http://codespeak.net/svn/z3/deliverance/branches/packaged/deliverance/proxycommand.py"
                    >put a command-line interface in front</a
                >.
            </p>
            <p>And it all Just Worked. WSGI is awesome.</p>
