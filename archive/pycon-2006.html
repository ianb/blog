</div><h1>PyCon 2006</h1>
 
<div class="document">
<p>So, I really enjoyed PyCon.  I felt a little overwhelmed at times.
There were a ton of people I wanted to talk to but didn't, or where we
only had a quick <em>hi</em>.</p>
<p>I wasn't sufficiently prepared for my talks.  I'm afraid the <a class="reference" href="http://ianbicking.org/docs/pycon2006/plugins.html">talk I
gave on Eggs</a> was
very well attended -- because Eggs are all the rage and people want to
know more about them -- but I didn't tell people what they needed to
know.  I gave a talk about the issues I've encountered using Eggs for
plugins, and some vague suggestions for how best handle that case, and
people really just need to know about basics; using Eggs for plugins
is something people will want to know about <em>next</em> year, this year
they just need to know about using Eggs at all.  And if I'm going to
talk about pitfalls and techniques, I should do so in a more concrete
way.  Like I could have told the story of Paste or something (Eggs
clarified a lot of things in Paste for me).  I felt better about my
other talk, which was more-or-less about deploying web applications.
Steve Holden <a class="reference" href="http://holdenweb.blogspot.com/2006/03/everything-about-web-programming.html">summarized it nicely</a>
-- I'm sure his summary is more useful than <a class="reference" href="http://ianbicking.org/docs/pycon2006/devel-process3.html">my slides</a>.  I was
really frustrated, though, that I couldn't find a picture of the scene
in Star Wars where Luke smashes Vader's helmet only to see his own
face.  Oh Internet, how could you have forsaken me!</p>
<p>Dallas turned out to be a fine venue.  I never spent much time
appreciating DC in previous PyCons anyway.  And for all the criticism
Dallas gets (probably simply because it is in Texas), Addison is
virtually indistinguishable from suburban Chicago (except warmer).
Which sucks for Addison and suburban Chicago -- glad I don't live in
either -- but it's perfectly fine as a venue for PyCon.</p>
<p>I think there was a lot of good communication between the different
web frameworks, especially with Django, TurboGears, and Zope people
all around for the sprints.  It's still a little hard to find the
actionable items for us to work on together, but I think everyone is
open to them as they emerge.</p>
<p>We made some really good progress on pushing WSGI further into
TurboGears during the sprint, with a branch that uses RhubarbTart and
streamlining the interaction of RT's CherryPy-style object publishing
with a heterogeneous stack that includes WSGI among other things.</p>
<p>Several Zope people were working hard at refactoring Zope 3 into a
series of eggs, which will also be really important.  People outside
of Zope are quite willing to use Zope 3 code and take advantage of the
things they've been doing there, but the packaging is really critical
to making that possible.  And with WSGI underneath Zope (and even
<a class="reference" href="http://awkly.org/archive/zope-paste-wsgi-applications-in-zope-3-using-paste-deploy">Paste support</a>!)
I'm hoping we see a much more fluid exchange with the rest of the
Python community.  Up until now, Zope's only exchange with other
Python web developers has been through <em>ideas</em> not actual <em>code</em>.  I
heard a couple rumors about renaming Zope 3 -- in part because it's
really Zope Five (the Zope 2 + Zope 3 fusion) that is continuing the
Zope legacy.  I think that also would be a good idea, but the
packaging is much more concretely important.  One of the first things
that would be nice to see extracted is the transaction manager.  A
modern and clean ZPT distribution would be nice too.  After that I
think Zope as a WSGI server would be nice to see -- making it easy to
embed other people's WSGI applications into Zope (both into 3 and
Five).</p>
<p>I had a long conversation over beers about Zope adaptation, with Chris
McDonough and Tres Seaver.  I'm anti-adaptation, I'm afraid, and I
think questions about adaptation and interfaces are going to be the
big barrier for adoption of bits and pieces of Zope 3.  As it is
zope.interfaces is the one requirement I expect almost every Zope 3
package will have, and that does scare people off.  In part Eggs will
help that, but I think adaptation is more intrusive than just the fear
of C extensions.  But we drank too many beers for me to remember the
entire argument.  Oddly, <em>interfaces</em> aren't really controversial, but
at the same time adaptation seems more comfortable for dynamic
languages (as interfaces without adaptation implies type checking).
And yet, it's adaptation that bends people's minds.  When it comes
down to it, I think:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>adaptation is being used for too much in Zope 3, including things
like event handling and generic functions; they are confusing
mechanism (the adapter lookup process, which is a useful and widely
applicable mechanism) with meaning (the adaptation of objects)</li>
<li>adaptation and interfaces require things being tied together in a
way that leads naturally to ZCML (declarative configuration of
components in Zope 3), and people don't really like ZCML</li>
<li>adaptation without declaration (with no ZCML) means that imports
become much more meaningful (because the declaration actually
happens imperatively at import time), and that sucks too</li>
<li>integrating truly separate packages from different sources happens
more cleanly/simply with Eggs and entry points, and this removes
some of the need for adaptation</li>
</ul>
<p>I'm hoping that Zope people will start to break down Zope into pieces
-- however small -- that don't depend on zope.interface.  And then
they'll start to visualize an infrastructure that doesn't require
adaptation; or they'll simply start using such an infrastructure
(perhaps if they start using WSGI in places as an internal protocol)
and they'll like it.  The Zope community I met at PyCon -- including
Jim Fulton (the Zope BDFL) -- all seem interested enough in
participating this larger, more inclusive, more fluid intersection of
web frameworks, and even radical changes in Zope 3's perspective don't
seem impossible.</p>
<p>But anyway, I kind of randomly digressed into Zope thoughts.  I feel
entirely optimistic about the interactions I saw between Python web
framework authors, and I look forward to that continuing.</p>
