        <div class="document">
            <p>
                So at
                <a class="reference" href="http://imagescape.com">my work</a>
                we're in this kind of weird limbo, where a lot (but not all) of
                our newer projects are in
                <a class="reference" href="http://webwareforpython.org"
                    >Webware</a
                >, and we have a lot of stuff left in Zope. And while some of it
                could really use a rewrite anyway -- especially the stuff from
                the Bad Old Days of pure DTML applications -- rewriting that
                stuff doesn't really <em>accomplish</em> anything. If it ain't
                broke...
            </p>
            <p>
                Anyway, some new little app came up, and I figured I'd stick to
                Zope because it was just too small to do in Webware, and we
                haven't completely figured out how we're doing Webware
                deployment -- the time invested is worth it for large projects,
                but this wasn't a large project. Making small projects in
                Webware more feasible is definitely important to me, but this
                project was starting to get overdue, so I couldn't figure out
                too much.
            </p>
            <p>
                But even then, I decided I'd do a little experimentation in
                Zope, and see if I could put the whole application into
                <a
                    class="reference"
                    href="http://www.easyleading.org/Downloads/"
                    >LocalFS</a
                >
                -- which means all the files would be on the disk. I could have
                written it as a Zope Product, but I don't see Zope as our future
                and I didn't feel like investing the effort. But these legacy
                applications -- written in DTML, ZPT, ZSQL, and Python Scripts,
                stored in the ZODB, edited through the web -- are going to be
                around for a while. And I <em>really</em> want them under source
                control for all sorts of reasons -- not just history, but ease
                of deployment, centralized indexing of our applications,
                synchronizing development in branches, and deploying
                applications.
            </p>
            <p>
                LocalFS, however, doesn't support ZSQL or Python Scripts. So I
                thought I'd try to fix that. In the end it wasn't as hard as I
                expected; it really is just Python code. The inheritance is out
                of control (with many base classes), and it has some funny
                idioms, and LocalFS is probably always going to be a little
                wonky in Zope (e.g., it doesn't participate in transactions),
                but to accomplish what we needed wasn't too hard. The code is
                accessible to humans. The only real catch was debugging in the
                presence of
                <a
                    class="reference"
                    href="http://www.plope.com/Books/2_7Edition/Acquisition.stx"
                    >Acquisition</a
                >
                (for a longer description of acquisition see
                <a
                    class="reference"
                    href="http://udell.roninhouse.com/bytecols/2001-06-13.html"
                    >this</a
                >). I am convinced that Zope would have been way, way, way
                better if they'd never used Acquisition -- it's a clever hack
                that <em>ruins</em> the entire system. Thankfully
                <a class="reference" href="http://dev.zope.org/Zope3">Zope 3</a>
                has gotten rid of Acquisition. The inheritance situation in Zope
                2 is difficult, but ultimately it's something you can get your
                head around if you read enough code (and probably you can avoid
                for small changes). But Acquisition simply ruins everything and
                makes the entire system unpredictable.
            </p>
            <p>
                I had thought about using
                <a
                    class="reference"
                    href="http://zope.org/Members/tseaver/FSDump/view"
                    >FSDump</a
                >, which dumps part of the ZODB out to disk, specifically for
                use with version control. But it's one-way, just for writing
                out. And our use of the ZODB is actually really conservative,
                with all our valuable code really in those four types, plus some
                configuration in Properties and database connections, so LocalFS
                allows us to keep the canonical version in the filesystem and
                avoid both the ZODB and ZMI entirely. And since all our volatile
                data is in a database, I think LocalFS is safe enough (I might
                be worried otherwise).
            </p>
            <p>
                I'll try to separate out the changes to LocalFS into a couple
                patches sometime soon, but for now I just thought I'd note the
                experience.

This is a repackaging of the CMF's FileSystem Directory Views such
that it is independent of the CMF.

The major use of this is to develop view code on the file system
such that it can be edited with normal development utilties and
checked into a source control management system.

                which is a really cool abstract storage layer for the ZODB
                (actually, it's meant to be / trying to be a standalone abstract
                persistence system). It has file system representation with
                knowledge of Z SQL Methods, Python Scripts, Page Templates, etc.
                I've used it before to move items to and from disk with a Zope
                copy/paste operation.
