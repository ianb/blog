                Unfortunately, it has also meant that Zope is not as easy to
                scale
                <em>down</em> to small applications. Not being able to scale
                down negatively impacts the learning curve, and that negatively
                impacts adoption. We should fix this, and in fact work has been
                done on it. You're right in that the &quot;hello world&quot;
                case should be even easier (even though Zope's &quot;hello
                world&quot; does a lot more than you'd think at first sight).
            </blockquote>
            <p>
                I assume &quot;Zope&quot; in this context applies to Zope 3;
                Zope 2 has a funny learning curve. I don't know what a Z-shaped
                curve is -- I think that breaks my concept of a what a learning
                curve looks like -- but the curve is one that starts as being
                really really easy, and then really really hard. Zope 3 doesn't
                have a really realy easy part (which is fine, since that just
                led to false starts in Zope 2, IMHO).
            </p>
            <p>
                But I'd say that Zope's scaling problem doesn't just hurt
                adoption, it really hurts development too. All applications
                start out as small applications. I could even invoke some hype
                word (maybe appending a version number) and say that the New Way
                Of Development involves lots of small interacting applications
                instead of large apps.
            </p>
            <p>
                Good development in the beginning means deferring choices as
                much as possible and focusing on results instead of
                abstractions. Abstractions should emerge from your functional
                goals, and if you spend a lot of time modeling in the beginning
                then you've made premature choices and designed code that you
                don't yet understand. You haven't just wasted time, you've
                introduced a liability.
            </p>
            <p>
                That doesn't mean abstractions are bad. I'm not saying we should
                all use PHP; sometimes it's faster to walk than drive, but using
                PHP is like living in a world where they haven't invented the
                wheel.
            </p>
            <p>
                Zope 2 allowed you to start without modeling at all, but down
                that road led an unmaintainable mess (you can do maintainable
                code in Zope 2, but it requires up-front modeling in the form of
                Product building). Zope 3 encourages modeling from the
                beginning, but I don't think that's the right lesson to learn
                from Zope 2. It wasn't that Zope 2 was wrong for allowing that
                simple start, but that it was misdesigned so that there was too
                much of a disconnect between the simple form of Zope 2 and the
                reasonably-manageable form.
            </p>
            <p>
                Anyway, there seems to be a lot Zope 3ers lately saying
                &quot;hey, what about us?&quot;, so there's my $0.02.

                <p>I might add an interesting bit.</p>
                <p>
                    I'm now beeing freshly employed the third week at a place
                    where a few people 3-4 years ago choose zope, when it was
                    hype.
                </p>
                <p>At the time, zope 2.6 and python 2.1 was choosen.</p>
                <p>
                    It went down as it inevitably would, the whole application
                    is an unmaintainable, horrid, overblown, side-effect ridden,
                    godawfull mess that has the nickname &quot;Fpos&quot;
                    (fucking piece of shit). The only customer who uses it at
                    the moment is running away from it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I took over the python-dev part there. I'm also new to zope.
                    The learning curve of zope 2 is exactly as you describe it.
                    So aparts from working with really messy code, I learn zope
                    the same time. The learning curve is as you say, a bit easy
                    at the start, and as soon as you relize that the only way to
                    do organized development is doing a proper product, it gets
                    really really hard.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Of course the existing application isn't really suited now
                    to be refactored, because half of it is build on the wrong
                    assumption, much code is just mental masturbation from
                    requirements that have since ceased to be important but it
                    was easier not to touch anything instead of throwing the
                    garbage out, etc. summa summarum, wash, rhinse, seppuku.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Time and time again, when I discuss what the application
                    does I'm told that much of it is easier to do with zope, and
                    that in fact zope 3 is much better now.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'm just not sure I really want to commit to -An even more
                    horrid learning curve -upfront design -a system that is by
                    nature incredibly rigid because nothing is agile, in effect,
                    forcing me after the upfront efford to get it running wholly
                    never to commit to refactoring easy, thus preventing it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I feel like I much rather take my chance, and reinvent some
                    wheels but be mobile from there on. Thank you all you zope
                    zealots.
                </p>
                <p>
                    P.S. To all you Zope zealots. By virtue of design of your
                    system, the mess I have to work with actively costs horrid
                    amounts of money. I'm only 3 weeks there, but already we
                    wasted about 5 man-weeks on fixing a simple data-modelling
                    issue, normally a few hours job. That's running costs spend
                    for nothing then maintaining your oh so great system, around
                    7k$ in 3 weeks and running. I don't even want to imagine how
                    much money that thing devoured in the 3-4 years it's running
                    already. Alone for that this thing doesn't belong into the
                    toolset of any professional, at least if you've a limited
                    amount of time and budget to burn on nothing.

                        I don't think it's fair to brow-beat Zope too much for
                        its past sins. We all know what they are, and I really
                        don't think anyone is defending Zope 2 as being a good
                        web development platform. Experience has made that clear
                        to many people, and Zope 3 very clearly tries to address
                        those issues. It's still useful to consider
                        <em>what</em> exactly have been the problems with Zope
                        2, and if Zope 3 addresses those problems in the proper
                        way, but they deserve credit for taking their punches
                        and then getting up and trying again.

                        OTOH, I know from experience when you are in the midst
                        of one of those horrible Zope 2 apps it's hard not to
                        get really ranty ;) It literally makes me ache when I
                        have to work with bad DTML/Z SQL/Acquisition code. When
                        the response to a tool becomes emotional -- and not in a
                        good way -- the brand has a lot to make up for. I think
                        the Zope brand is experiencing that.

                    I agree with your development philosophy. I just think the
                    basic assumption that Zope 3 encourages modeling and thus
                    you cannot do iterative development with it is not correct.
                    I think it's important for Zope 3 to criticisms into account
                    (and Jim Fulton is actually very good at this in my
                    experience; he even puts up with my sometimes grating
                    harping! :), and I think the criticism that &quot;hello
                    world &quot;is too large is valuable and important. You
                    can't extrapolate from that into a wrong idea of what Zope 3
                    development is about, however. Zope 3 is primarily about
                    letting a Python developer write proper, clean and Pythonic
                    Python code. See here a longer reply:
