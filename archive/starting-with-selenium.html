                There's a lot of complicated stuff about Selenium out there, but
                it's actually really simple. Grig

                also had a quick start for Windows/IE. Here's my quick start:
            </p>
            <ul class="simple">
                <li>
                    Check out svn://... somewhere where your web server can see
                    it. Lets say it's in
                    <tt class="docutils literal"
                        ><span class="pre">/selenium</span></tt
                    >. This must be the same web server that your application is
                    on.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Go view
                    <tt class="docutils literal"
                        ><span class="pre"
                            >/selenium/javascript/TestRunner.html</span
                        ></tt
                    >
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Voila! Was that so hard? All that server instrumentation stuff,
                Twisted stuff, etc... really, just don't worry about that. Maybe
                later, but it's no place to start.
            </p>
            <p>
                Now, go to
                <tt class="docutils literal"
                    ><span class="pre">selenium/javascript/tests/</span></tt
                >
                and edit
                <tt class="docutils literal"
                    ><span class="pre">TestSuite.html</span></tt
                >
                to add more tests (or get rid of the ones that are there), and
                copy one of the files like
                <tt class="docutils literal"
                    ><span class="pre">TestOpen.html</span></tt
                >
                to start your own test (both files are extremely simple -- one's
                a list of links, the other is a table of commands).
            </p>
            <p>
                There's more of course, but there's always more. One thing that
                caught me is that you must refer to links and submit buttons
                using a limited number of
                <a
                    class="reference"
                    href="http://selenium.thoughtworks.com/testrunner.html#element-locators"
                    >Element Locators</a
                >
                -- by id (but I don't give my links ids!), with a Javascript DOM
                expression (icky domNamesEverywhere!), or with
                <a class="reference" href="http://www.w3schools.com/xpath/"
                    >XPath</a
                >. I chose XPath, even though I've never used XPath, and here's
                my mini-tutorial:
            </p>
            <p>To follow a link by its text:</p>
            <pre class="literal-block">
//a[text()='link text']
</pre
            >
            <p>I haven't tried this, but maybe it would work more fuzzily:</p>
            <pre class="literal-block">
//a[contains(text(), 'partial text')]
</pre
            >
            <p>And for a submit button:</p>
            <pre class="literal-block">
//input[&#64;type='submit']
</pre
            >
            <p>Or:</p>
            <pre class="literal-block">
//input[&#64;value='Button Description']
</pre
            >
            <p>
                Anyway, hopefully we'll get this information into the
                documentation, and a quick start with Selenium will become more
                approachable.
            </p>
            <p>
                I also started working on some infrastructure. The first is
                expanding and improving a script that takes
                <a
                    class="reference"
                    href="http://hathawaymix.org/Software/TCPWatch"
                    >tcpwatch</a
                >
                logs and turns them into test scripts (<tt
                    class="docutils literal"
                    ><span class="pre">tcpwatch_scriptgen.py</span></tt
                >). I previously generated
                <a class="reference" href="http://pbp.berlios.de/">PBP</a>
                scripts (and in the future probably
                <a
                    class="reference"
                    href="http://issola.caltech.edu/~t/twill/README.html"
                    >Twill</a
                >
                scripts); now you can also make Selenium scripts.
            </p>
            <p>
                The second is a CGI-based test suite. You can use a URL like
                <tt class="docutils literal"
                    ><span class="pre"
                        >/selenium/javascript/TestRunner.html?test=/path/to/TestSuite.html</span
                    ></tt
                >
                to use something other than
                <tt class="docutils literal"
                    ><span class="pre"
                        >selenium/javascript/tests/TestSuite.html</span
                    ></tt
                >
                -- which is nice, because you don't want to mix your application
                tests with the Selenium code. Anyway, you point it to the
                <tt class="docutils literal"
                    ><span class="pre">selenium_suite.py</span></tt
                >
                CGI script and it'll index all the suites you put in some
                directory.
            </p>
            <p>
                Oh... and that CGI program can also turn comma-separated-value
                files into HTML tables, so you can write or edit your tests in a
                spreadsheet (which, I think, is an improvement over an HTML
                editor). And now
                <tt class="docutils literal"
                    ><span class="pre">tcpwatch_scriptgen.py</span></tt
                >
                can create both CSV files and HTML tables.
            </p>
            <p>
                All of this, temporarily, is located in
                <a
                    class="reference"
                    href="http://svn.colorstudy.com/home/ianb/webtest_experiement/"
                    >http://svn.colorstudy.com/home/ianb/webtest_experiement/</a
                >
                -- but it'll move someplace more permanent later. Maybe there
                will be a place for it in the Selenium repository, otherwise
                I'll put it in the Webware repository.

                    Great post, Ian. I was going to send you an email to suggest
                    you post your experiences so that we can keep the Selenium
                    momentum going, but you were one step ahead of me...Good

                    Hopefully we can combine your post with some of the stuff I
                    wrote on the Twisted server and contribute this way to the
                    Selenium documentation.

                    This is great stuff! :-) The Selenium project is benefiting
                    immeasurably now that we've caught the attention of Ian and
                    Grig!

                <p>
                    About converting tcpwatch logs into Selenium scripts... What
                    you wrote is very cool. A frequently asked question from new
                    users is whether we have test recording utility... Now we
                    have one. :-). I think it will probably catch most general
                    cases, but, not everything that can be tested shows up in
                    the TCP stream. If I have some JavaScript widgets in my page
                    that do not trigger a trip to the server, they probably
                    won't be picked up by your tool... And Selenium was
                    specifically developed to test apps that that use
                    JavaScript. So I think to capture everything, the event
                    capturing (and translation into a test script) needs to be
                    handled by JavaScript not in the TCP stream.

                    Thanks for the quick start. It is sooo fast to get started
                    using this software. I wish the docs were clearer on that
                    because most people want to dive in and start using it and
                    worry about Twisted later. This post shows how easy it is!
                </p>
                <p>
                    One thing: if you want to click by partial text you should
                    use
                </p>
                <p>//a[contains('partial text',text() )]</p>
                <p>as the Xpath expression, and it works like a charm.</p>
