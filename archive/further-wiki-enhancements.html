                    href="http://blog.colorstudy.com/system/comments.py?u=0000001&amp;p=P84&amp;link=http://blog.colorstudy.com/ianb/weblog/2004/04/11.html%23P84"

                in my last post, I added some new features to the
                <a class="reference" href="http://wiki.webwareforpython.org"
                    >Wiki</a
                >. Now the Wiki can be published to a static location (<a
                    class="reference"
                    href="http://www.webwareforpython.org/~ianb/staticwiki/wikifeatures.html"
                    >an example</a
                >), giving an up-to-date copy of the site that can be served
                without any special software. All the links <em>in</em> the wiki
                have also grown
                <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">.html</span></tt>
                extensions, so those links match the links you'll find in the
                static site (this is configurable). The page generation is
                controlled with a
                <a class="reference" href="http://cheetahtemplate.org"
                    >Cheetah</a
                >
                <a
                    class="reference"
                    href="http://www.webwareforpython.org/~ianb/w4py.org/Wiki/lib/default_static.tmpl"
                    >template</a
                >.
            </p>
            <p>
                This might actually include everything you'd need to use the
                Wiki as a blog. The
                <a
                    class="reference"
                    href="http://wiki.webwareforpython.org/rss.xml"
                    >RSS</a
                >
                gives you the syndication. The static publishing gives you
                the... well, ease of deployment (remote static publishing
                wouldn't be a hard). Simply create new pages instead of posting
                to your blog. Still needs comments (which is more a UI issue
                than anything), though you could do that in the template, using
                an SSI/CGI-based comment program. It's also missing some of the
                date indexing, and the front page aggregation (where you show
                multiple entries on a single page). Categories would be nice too
                -- I'm thinking a keyword system would be sufficient.

                Or it could be a simple CMS. Still needs non-reST content
                support for that, but I don't think that will be too hard.
            </p>

                Anyway, I'm having fun hacking on it... I'm trying to make the
                code more accessible to others as I go along as well.
