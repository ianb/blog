                                            but I&#8217;ve been thinking about
                                            something a bit more basic: a way to
                                            simply ship server applications,
                                            bundles of code. Web applications
                                            are just one use case for this.

                                            For now lets call this a
                                            &quot;Python application
                                            package&quot;. It has these

                                                There is an
                                                <em>application description</em
                                                >: this tells the
                                                <em>environment</em> about the
                                                application. (This is sometimes
                                                called &quot;configuration&quot;
                                                but that term is very confusing
                                                and overloaded; I think
                                                &quot;description&quot; is much
                                                clearer.)
                                            </li>
                                            <li>
                                                Given the description, you can
                                                create an execution environment
                                                to run code from the application
                                                and acquire objects from the
                                                application. So there would be a
                                                specific way to setup
                                                <tt class="docutils literal"

                                                >, and a way to indicate any
                                                libraries that are required but
                                                not bundled directly with the
                                                application.
                                            </li>
                                            <li>
                                                The environment can inject
                                                information into the
                                                application. (Also this sort of
                                                thing is sometimes called
                                                &quot;configuration&quot;, but
                                                let&#8217;s not do that either.)
                                                This is where the environment
                                                could indicate, for instance,
                                                what database the application
                                                should connect to (host,
                                                username, etc).
                                            </li>
                                            <li>
                                                There would be a way to run
                                                commands and get objects from
                                                the application. The environment
                                                would look in the application
                                                description to get the names of
                                                commands or objects, and use
                                                them in some specific manner
                                                depending on the purpose of the
                                                application. For instance, WSGI
                                                web applications would point the
                                                environment to an application
                                                object. A Tornado application
                                                might simply have a command to
                                                start itself (with the
                                                environment indicating what port
                                                to use through its injection).
                                            </li>
                                        </ol>
                                        <p>
                                            There&#8217;s a lot of things you
                                            can build from these pieces, and in
                                            a sophisticated application you
                                            might use a bunch of them at once.
                                            You might have some WSGI, maybe a
                                            seperate non-WSGI server to handle
                                            Web Sockets, something for a Celery
                                            queue, a way to accept incoming
                                            email, etc. In pretty much all cases
                                            I think basic application lifecycle
                                            is needed: commands to run when an
                                            application is first installed,
                                            something to verify the environment
                                            is acceptable, when you want to back
                                            up its data, when you want to
                                            uninstall it.

                                        <p>
                                            There&#8217;s also some things that
                                            all environments should setup the
                                            same or inject into the application.
                                            E.g.,
                                            <tt class="docutils literal"
                                                ><span class="pre"
                                                    >$TMPDIR</span
                                                ></tt
                                            >
                                            should point to a place where the
                                            application can keep its temporary
                                            files. Or, every application should
                                            have a directory (perhaps specified
                                            in another environmental variable)
                                            where it can write log files.
                                        </p>
                                        <div class="section" id="details">

                                                To get more concrete,
                                                here&#8217;s what I can imagine
                                                from a small application
                                                description; probably YAML would
                                                be a good format:

                                                I found PHP support relatively
                                                easy to add (handling languages

                                                of a stretch). So

                                                application uses. You can
                                                imagine lots of modularization
                                                for other features, but it would
                                                be easy and unproductive to get
                                                distracted by that.

                                                The application has certain
                                                requirements of its environment,
                                                like the version of Python and
                                                the general OS type. The
                                                application might also require
                                                libraries, ideally one libraries
                                                that are not portable (M2Crypto
                                                being an example). Modern
                                                package management works pretty
                                                nicely for this stuff, so

                                                reliable if applications
                                                primarily rely on bundling their
                                                dependencies directly (i.e.,
                                                using a vendor directory). The
                                                tool support for this is a bit
                                                spotty, but I believe this
                                                package format could clarify the
                                                problems and solutions.

                                                You can imagine building hosting

                                                or setting up continuous

                                                If designed properly, I think
                                                this format is as usable for
                                                local development as it is for
                                                deployment. It should be able to
                                                run directly from a checkout,
                                                with the &quot;development
                                                environment&quot; being an
                                                environment just like any other.
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                                This rules out, or at least
                                                makes less exciting, the use of
                                                zip files or tarballs as a
                                                package format. The only
                                                justification I see for using
                                                such archives is that they are
                                                easy to move around; but we live
                                                in the FUTURE and there are many
                                                ways to move directories around
                                                and we don&#8217;t need to cater
                                                to silly old fashions. If that
                                                means a script that creates a
                                                tarball, FTPs it to another
                                                computer, and there it is
                                                unzipped, then fine &#8211; this
                                                format
                                                <em>should not</em> specify
                                                anything about how you actually
                                                deliver the files. But
                                                let&#8217;s not worry about
                                                copying

                                            At PyCon there was an open space
                                            about deployment, and the idea of
                                            drop-in applications
                                            (Java-WAR-style).

                                            I generally get pessimistic about
                                            80% solutions, and dropping in a WAR
                                            file feels like an 80% solution to
                                            me. I&#8217;ve used the
                                            Hudson/Jenkins installer (which I
                                            think is <em>specifically</em> a
                                            project that got WARs on
                                            people&#8217;s minds), and in a lot
                                            of ways that installer is nice, but
                                            it&#8217;s also kind of wonky, it
                                            makes configuration unclear,
                                            it&#8217;s not always clear when it
                                            installs or configures itself
                                            through the web, and when you have
                                            to do this at the system level, nor
                                            is it clear where it puts files and
                                            data, etc. So a great initial
                                            experience doesn&#8217;t feel like a
                                            great ongoing experience to me
                                            &#8212; and
                                            <em

                                                that way</em
                                            >. If those were
                                            <em>necessary</em> compromises,
                                            sure, but they aren&#8217;t. And
                                            because we
                                            <em>don&#8217;t have</em> WAR files,
                                            if we&#8217;re proposing to make
                                            something new, then we have every
                                            opportunity to make things better.

                                            So the question then is what
                                            we&#8217;re trying to make. To me:
                                            we want applications that are easy
                                            to install, that are
                                            self-describing, self-configuring
                                            (or at least guide you through
                                            configuration), reliable with
                                            respect to their environment (not
                                            dependent on system tweaking),
                                            upgradable, and respectful of
                                            persistence (the data that outlives
                                            the application install). A lot of
                                            this can be done by the
                                            &quot;container&quot; (to use Java
                                            parlance; or
                                            &quot;environment&quot;) &#8212; if
                                            you just have the app packaged in a
                                            nice way, the container (server
                                            environment, hosting service, etc)
                                            can handle all the system-specific
                                            things to make the application
                                            actually work.

                                            project, which defines something
                                            very much like this. Silver Lining
                                            isn&#8217;t <em>just</em> an
                                            application format, and things
                                            aren&#8217;t fully extracted along
                                            these lines, but it&#8217;s pretty
                                            close and it addresses a lot of
                                            important issues in the lifecycle of
                                            an application. To be clear: Silver
                                            Lining is an application packaging
                                            format, a server configuration
                                            library, a cloud server management
                                            tool, a persistence management tool,
                                            and a tool to manage the application
                                            with respect to all these services
                                            over time. It is a bunch of things,
                                            maybe too many things, so it is not
                                            unreasonable to pick out a smaller
                                            subset to focus on. Maybe an easy
                                            place to start (and good for Silver
                                            Lining itself) would be to separate
                                            at least the application format (and
                                            tools to manage applications in that
                                            state, e.g., installing new
                                            libraries) from the tools that make
                                            use of such applications (deploy,
                                            etc).

                                            Some opinions I have on this format,
                                            exemplified in Silver Lining:
                                        </p>
                                        <ul class="simple">

                                                single file, unlike WARs.
                                                Uploading zip files is not a
                                                great API. Geez. I know
                                                there&#8217;s this desire to

                                                but there&#8217;s no getting

                                                the outside&quot;. That is, an
                                                application requests services,
                                                and the <em>container</em> tells
                                                the application where those
                                                services are. For Silver Lining
                                                I&#8217;ve used environmental
                                                variables. I think this one
                                                point is really important
                                                &#8212; the container
                                                <em>tells</em> the application.
                                                As a counter-example, an
                                                application that comes with a
                                                Puppet deployment recipe is
                                                essentially <em>telling</em> the
                                                server how to arrange itself to
                                                suit the application. This will
                                                never be reliable or simple!

                                            <li>
                                                The application indicates what
                                                &quot;services&quot; it wants;
                                                for instance, it may want to
                                                have access to a MySQL database.
                                                The container then provides this
                                                to the application. In practice
                                                this means installing the actual
                                                packages, but also creating a
                                                database and setting up
                                                permissions appropriately. The
                                                alternative is never having
                                                <em>any</em> dependencies,
                                                meaning you have to use SQLite
                                                databases or ad hoc structures,
                                                etc. But in fact installing
                                                databases really isn&#8217;t
                                                that hard these days.

                                                are given in different

                                                some.

                                                it gives the application the
                                                chance to signal that the
                                                installation failed.

                                                sense of configuration. You

                                                provided for these cases.

                                                probably suitable for the
                                                bundled libraries; silver
                                                includes tools to manage things,
                                                but it gets a little twisty.
                                                When creating a new project I
                                                find myself creating several
                                                <tt class="docutils literal"

                                                modules, etc. Managing vendor
                                                libraries is also not obvious.

                                                useful, but also need to be
                                                carefully specified.

                                                There&#8217;s a bunch of runtime
                                                expectations that aren&#8217;t
                                                part of the format, but in
                                                practice would be part of how
                                                the application is written. For
                                                instance, I make sure each app
                                                has its own temporary directory,
                                                and that it is cleared on
                                                update. If you keep session
                                                files in that location, and you
                                                expect the environment to clean
                                                up old sessions &#8212; well,
                                                either all environments should
                                                do that, or none should.

                                                The process model is not
                                                entirely clear. I tried to
                                                simply define one process model
                                                (unthreaded, multiple
                                                processes), but I&#8217;m not
                                                sure that&#8217;s suitable
                                                &#8212; most notably, multiple
                                                processes have a significant
                                                memory impact compared to
                                                threads. An application should
                                                at least be able to indicate
                                                what process models it accepts
                                                and prefers.

                                                would be at

                                                <em>good</em>, but putting all
                                                static files under one URL path
                                                (e.g.,
                                                <tt class="docutils literal"
                                                    ><span class="pre"

                                                as well. Maybe there should be
                                                conventions for both.

                                                Cron jobs are important. Though

                                                another kind of service? Many
                                                extra features could be new
                                                services.

                                                Logging is also important;
                                                Silver Lining attempts to handle
                                                that somewhat, but it could be
                                                specified much better.

                                                Silver Lining also supports PHP,
                                                which seemed to cause a bit of
                                                stress. But just ignore that.
                                                It&#8217;s really easy to

                                            only really specified in code; but
                                            in Silver Lining&#8217;s defense,
                                            specified in code is better than
                                            unspecified ;) App Engine provides
                                            another example of an application
                                            format, and would be worth using as
                                            a point of discussion or contrast (I
                                            did that myself when writing Silver

                                            Discussing WSGI stuff with Ben
                                            Bangert at PyCon he noted that he
                                            didn&#8217;t really feel like the
                                            WSGI pieces needed that much more
                                            work, or at least that&#8217;s not
                                            where the interesting work was
                                            &#8212; the interesting work is in
                                            the tooling. An application format
                                            could provide a great basis for
                                            building this tooling. And I
                                            honestly think that the tooling has
                                            been held back more by divergent
                                            patterns of development than by the
                                            difficulty of writing the tools
                                            themselves; and a good, general
                                            application format could fix that.

                                            I&#8217;ve been leaning heavily on
                                            Ubuntu and Debian packages for

                                            management&quot; problems are easy
                                            when you rely on the system
                                            packages&#8230; not for any magical
                                            reason, but because the package
                                            maintainers have done the
                                            configuration management for me.
                                            This includes dependencies, but also
                                            things like starting up services in
                                            the right order, and of course
                                            upgrades and security fixes. For
                                            this reason I really want everything
                                            that isn&#8217;t part of Silver
                                            Lining&#8217;s core to be in the
                                            form of a package.

                                            But then, why isn&#8217;t
                                            <em>everything</em> a package?
                                            Arguably some pieces really should
                                            be, I&#8217;m just too lazy and
                                            developing those pieces too quickly
                                            to do it. But more specifically, why
                                            aren&#8217;t applications packages?
                                            It&#8217;s not the complexity really
                                            &#8212; the tool could encapsulate
                                            all the complexity of packaging if I
                                            chose. I always knew intuitively it
                                            didn&#8217;t make sense, but it took
                                            me a while to decide quite
                                            <em>why</em>.

                                            There are a lot of specific reasons,
                                            but the overriding reason is that I
                                            don&#8217;t want to

                                            something it does, but that&#8217;s
                                            not its purpose, and so it can
                                            install a server with

                                            lot of work, it&#8217;s building on
                                            the knowledge of people more
                                            interested in MySQL than I, but
                                            it&#8217;s also deferring a lot of
                                            control. When it comes to actually
                                            deploying applications I&#8217;m not
                                            willing to have Silver Lining defer
                                            to another system, because deploying
                                            applications is the
                                            <em>entire point</em> of the tool.

                                            There are many specific reasons. I
                                            want multiple instances of an
                                            application deployed simultaneously.
                                            I can optimize the actual code
                                            delivery (using rsync) instead of
                                            delivering an entire bundle of code.
                                            The setup is specific to the
                                            environment and configuration
                                            I&#8217;ve set up on servers,
                                            it&#8217;s not a generic package
                                            that makes sense on a generic Ubuntu
                                            system. I don&#8217;t want any
                                            central repository of packages or a
                                            single place where releases have to
                                            go through. I want to allow for the
                                            possibility of multiple versions of
                                            an application running
                                            simultaneously. I&#8217;m
                                            coordinating services even as I
                                            deploy the application, something
                                            which Debian packages try to do a
                                            <em>little</em>, but don&#8217;t do
                                            consistently or well. But while
                                            there&#8217;s a list of reasons, it
                                            doesn&#8217;t matter that much
                                            &#8212; there&#8217;s no particular
                                            size of list that scared me off, and
                                            if I&#8217;m misinformed about the
                                            way packages work or if there are
                                            techniques to avoid these problems
                                            it doesn&#8217;t really matter to
                                            me&#8230; the real reason is that I
                                            don&#8217;t want to defer control
                                            over the one thing that Silver
                                            Lining <em>must</em> do well.

                                            After some pondering at PyCon, I
                                            decided on a new name for toppcloud:
                                            <strong>Silver Lining</strong>.
                                            I&#8217;ll credit a mysterious
                                            commenter &quot;david&quot; with the
                                            name idea. The command line is
                                            simply
                                            <tt class="docutils literal"

                                            &#8212;
                                            <tt class="docutils literal"

                                            has a nice ring to it.

                                            There&#8217;s a new site:

                                            >; not notably different than the
                                            old site, just a new name. The
                                            product is self-hosting now, using a
                                            <a
                                                class="reference external"

                                            that runs after every commit to
                                            regenerate the docs, and with a
                                            small extension to Silver Lining
                                            itself (to make it easier to host
                                            static files). Now that it has a
                                            real name I also gave it a
                                            <a
                                                class="reference external"

                                            Silver Lining also has its

                                            test. I&#8217;m hoping with a
                                            <a
                                                class="reference external"

                                            that a full integration test can run
                                            in a reasonable amount of time.
                                            <em>Some</em> unit tests would be
                                            possible, but so far most of the
                                            bugs have been interaction bugs so I
                                            think integration tests will have to
                                            pull most of the weight. (A
                                            continuous integration rig will be
                                            very useful; I am not sure if Silver
                                            Lining can self-host that, though
                                            it&#8217;d be nice/clever if it
                                            could.)

                                            Deployment is one of the things I
                                            like least about development, and
                                            yet without deployment the
                                            development doesn&#8217;t really
                                            matter.

                                            <em>less</em> as a result. Then I
                                            got excited about

                                            <strong>But</strong> I can&#8217;t
                                            actually <em>use</em> App Engine. I
                                            was able to come to terms with the
                                            idea of writing an application to
                                            the platform, but there are
                                            limits&#8230; and with App Engine
                                            there were simply too many limits.
                                            Geo stuff on App Engine is at best a
                                            crippled hack, I miss

                                            terribly, I never hated relational
                                            databases, and almost nothing large
                                            works without some degree of
                                            rewriting. Sometimes you can work
                                            around it, but you can never be sure
                                            you won&#8217;t hit some wall later.
                                            And frankly working around the
                                            platform is tiring and not very
                                            rewarding.

                                            So&#8230; App Engine seemed neat,
                                            but I couldn&#8217;t use it, and
                                            deployment was still a problem.

                                            What I like about App Engine: an
                                            application is just files.
                                            There&#8217;s no build process, no
                                            fancy copying of things in weird
                                            locations, nothing like that; you
                                            upload files, and uploading files
                                            <em>just works</em>. Also, you can
                                            check <em>everything</em> into
                                            version control. Not just your
                                            application code, but every library
                                            you use, the exact files that you
                                            installed. I really wanted a system
                                            like that.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            At the same time, I started looking
                                            into &quot;the cloud&quot;. It took
                                            me a while to get a handle on what
                                            &quot;cloud computing&quot; really
                                            means. What I learned: don&#8217;t
                                            overthink it. It&#8217;s not magic.
                                            It&#8217;s just virtual private
                                            servers that can be requisitioned
                                            automatically via an API, and are
                                            billed on a short time cycle. You
                                            can expand or change the definition
                                            a bit, but this definition is the
                                            one that matters to <em>me</em>.
                                            (I&#8217;ve also realized that I
                                            cannot get excited about complicated
                                            solutions; only once I realized how
                                            simple cloud computing is could I
                                            really get excited about the idea.)

                                            Given the modest functionality of
                                            cloud computing, why does it matter?
                                            Because with a cloud computing
                                            system you can actually
                                            <em>test</em> the full deployment
                                            stack. You can create a brand-new
                                            server, identical to all servers you
                                            will create in the future; you can
                                            set this server up; you can deploy
                                            to it. You get it wrong, you throw
                                            away that virtual server and start
                                            over from the beginning, fixing
                                            things until you get it right.
                                            Billing is important here too; with
                                            hourly billing you pay cents for
                                            these tests, and you don&#8217;t
                                            need a pool of ready servers because
                                            the cloud service basically manages
                                            that pool of ready servers for you.

                                            Without &quot;cloud computing&quot;
                                            we each too easily find ourselves in
                                            a situation where deployments are ad
                                            hoc, server installations develop
                                            over time, and servers and
                                            applications are inconsistent in
                                            their configuration. Cloud computing
                                            makes servers disposable, which
                                            means we can treat them in
                                            consistent ways, testing our work as
                                            we go. It makes it easy to treat
                                            operations with the same discipline
                                            as software.

                                            Given the idea from App Engine, and
                                            the easy-to-use infrastructure of a
                                            cloud service, I started to script
                                            together something to manage the
                                            servers and start up applications. I
                                            didn&#8217;t know what exactly I
                                            wanted to do to start, and I&#8217;m
                                            not completely sure where I&#8217;m
                                            going with this. But on the whole
                                            this feels pretty right. So I
                                            present the provisionally-named:
                                            <a

                                            (<strong>Update</strong>: this has
                                            been renamed Silver Cloud).

                                        <p>
                                            How it works: first you have a
                                            directory of files that defines your
                                            application. This probably includes
                                            a checkout of your
                                            &quot;application&quot; (let&#8217;s
                                            say in
                                            <tt class="docutils literal"

                                                ></tt
                                            >), and I find it also useful to use
                                            source control on the libraries
                                            (which are put in

                                            description of the environment. You
                                            do not specify database connection
                                            details, for instance. Instead your
                                            application <em>requests</em> access
                                            to a database service. For instance,
                                            one of these services is a
                                            PostgreSQL/PostGIS database (which

                                            Engine that&#8217;s an
                                            implementation detail you can
                                            actually <em>look</em> at and change
                                            (by changing toppcloud), but
                                            it&#8217;s not something you are
                                            supposed to concern yourself with
                                            during regular application
                                            development.

                                            There&#8217;s a few other things

                                            active version of applications.
                                            It&#8217;s growing to fit a variety
                                            of workflows, but I don&#8217;t
                                            think its growth is unbounded.

                                            From the outside it doen&#8217;t do
                                            a lot. From the inside it&#8217;s
                                            not actually that complicated
                                            either. I&#8217;ve included a lot of
                                            constraints in the tool but I think
                                            it offers an excellent balance. The
                                            constraints are workable for
                                            applications (insignificant for many
                                            applications), while still exposing
                                            a simple and consistent system
                                            that&#8217;s easier to reason about
                                            than a big-ball-of-server.

                                                need to request that package

                                                practice. I might have gotten

                                                that should be resolved inside
                                                toppcloud, not inside
                                                applications. Is Varnish a

                                                but if it is we should all be
                                                able to agree on that and
                                                replace it. If there are
                                                genuinely different needs then
                                                maybe additional application or
                                                deployment configuration will be
                                                called for &#8212; but we
                                                shouldn&#8217;t add
                                                configuration just because
                                                someone <em>says</em> there is a

                                                practice that is not universally
                                                better); there must be
                                                justifications.

                                                persistence some additional code
                                                is required for each such

                                                centralized in toppcloud, but it
                                                means we can also start to add
                                                consistent tools usable across a

                                                moved around. I know of some
                                                particularly problematic files
                                                (e.g.,

                                                these automatically. Mostly this
                                                isn&#8217;t so hard to do.

                                            Unlike generalized systems like
                                            buildout this system avoids
                                            &quot;building&quot; entirely,
                                            making deployment a simpler and
                                            lower risk action, leaning on system
                                            packages for the things they do
                                            best. Other open source tools
                                            emphasize a greater degree of
                                            flexibility than I think is
                                            necessary, allowing people to encode

                                            systems (what I&#8217;ve seen in a
                                            lot of &quot;cloud&quot; tools) this
                                            encorporates both the development

                                            environment; but unlike some
                                            developer-oriented systems this does
                                            not try to normalize
                                            everyone&#8217;s environment and

                                            appropriate. And unlike
                                            platform-neutral systems this can
                                            ensure an amount of reliability and
                                            predictability through extremely
                                            hard requirements (it is deployed on

                                            Toppcloud is solidly web framework

                                            code for each persistence technique,
                                            it is fairly easy to do, and there
                                            are no requirements for
                                            &quot;scalable systems&quot;; I
                                            think unscalable systems are a
                                            perfectly reasonable implementation
                                            choice for many problems. I believe
                                            a more scalable system could be
                                            built on this, but as a deployment
                                            and development option, not a
                                            starting requirement.

                                            So far I&#8217;ve done some
                                            deployments using toppcloud; not a
                                            lot, but some. And I can say that it
                                            feels really good; lots of rough
                                            edges still, but the core concept
                                            feels really right. I&#8217;ve made
                                            a lot of sideways attacks on
                                            deployment, and a few direct
                                            attacks&#8230; sometimes I write
                                            things that I think are useful, and
                                            sometimes I write things that I
                                            think are right. Toppcloud is at the
                                            moment maybe more right than useful.
                                            But I genuinely believe this is (in
                                            theory) a universally appropriate
                                            deployment tool.

                                            Now, the letdown. One thing I cannot
                                            offer you is support.
                                            <strong>THERE IS NO SUPPORT</strong
                                            >. I cannot now, and I might never
                                            really be able to support this tool.
                                            This tool is appropriate for
                                            collaborators, for people who like
                                            the idea and are ready to build on
                                            it. If it grows well I hope that it
                                            can grow a community, I hope people
                                            can support each other. I&#8217;d
                                            like to help that happen. But I
                                            can&#8217;t do that by bootstrapping
                                            it through unending support, because
                                            I&#8217;m not good at it and
                                            I&#8217;m not consistent and
                                            it&#8217;s unrealistic and
                                            unsustainable. This is not a open
                                            source dead drop. But it&#8217;s
                                            also not My Future; I&#8217;m not
                                            going to build a company around it,
                                            and I&#8217;m not going to use all
                                            my free time supporting it.
                                            It&#8217;s a tool I want to exist. I
                                            <strong>very much</strong> want it
                                            to exist. But even very much wanting
                                            something is not the same as being
                                            an undying champion, and I am not an
                                            undying champion. If you want to
                                            tell me what my process
                                            <em>should</em> be, please do!

                                            I&#8217;ll describe out to do the
                                            same things with pip.

                                            Here&#8217;s a kind of development
                                            workflow that I think works well:

                                                A framework release is prepared.
                                                Ideally there&#8217;s a buildbot

                                                Using a buildbot maybe future
                                                versions will also work
                                                together, but they won&#8217;t
                                                necessarily work together with
                                                applications built on the
                                                framework. And breakage can also
                                                occur regardless of a buildbot.

                                                but just because they&#8217;ve
                                                installed something
                                                doesn&#8217;t mean they really
                                                mean to stay with an old
                                                version. While known conflicts
                                                have been noted, there&#8217;s
                                                going to be lots of unknown
                                                conflicts and future conflicts.

                                                When starting development with a
                                                framework, the developer would
                                                like to start with some
                                                known-good set, which is a set
                                                that can be developed by the
                                                framework developers, or
                                                potentially by any person. For
                                                instance, if you extend a public
                                                framework with an internal
                                                framework (or even a public

                                                be developed by a different set
                                                of people.

                                                As an application is developed,
                                                the developer will add on other
                                                libraries, or use some of their
                                                own libraries. Development will
                                                probably occur at the trunk/tip
                                                of several libraries as they are
                                                developed together.

                                                upgrade one piece (for instance,
                                                to get a bug fix they are

                                                At any time, another developer
                                                may want to clone the same set
                                                of libraries.

                                                single component, if only to
                                                test that an upgrade works, or
                                                if it resolves a bug. They may
                                                test out combinations only to
                                                throw them away, and they
                                                don&#8217;t want to bump
                                                versions of libraries in order

                                            provide a known-good set of
                                            packages. Or they can provide a
                                            starting point for an active line of
                                            development. Or they can provide a
                                            historical record of how something
                                            was put together.

                                            The easy way to start a requirement

                                            have used the last release. So you

                                            framework developers maintain one
                                            file, and then also have developers
                                            maintain their own lists for their
                                            projects?

                                        <p>
                                            You could start with a file like
                                            this for the framework itself.
                                            Pylons for instance could ship with
                                            something like this. To install
                                            Pylons you could then do:

                                            control, and diffs would be
                                            sensible.

                                            That is, requirements files can
                                            refer to each other. So if you want
                                            to maintain your own requirements
                                            file alongside the development of an
                                            upstream requirements file, you
                                            could do that.

                                            thoughts could take a long time, but
                                            I thought at least I should correct
                                            some errors, specifically category
                                            errors. Figuring out where all the
                                            pieces in Setuptools (and pip and
                                            virtualenv) fit
                                            <em>is</em> difficult, so I
                                            don&#8217;t blame James for making
                                            some mistakes, but in the interest
                                            of clarifying the discussion&#8230;

                                                some other metadata too
                                                (description, version, etc), and
                                                Setuptools adds to that metadata

                                                won&#8217;t do anything with
                                                that extra data. Fixing this
                                                problem in Distutils is an
                                                important aspect of Setuptools,
                                                and part of what Distutils
                                                itself unsuitable as a basis for
                                                good library management.

                                                This is something you import. It
                                                is not the same as a
                                                distribution, though usually a
                                                distribution will have the same
                                                name as a package. In my own
                                                libraries I try to name the
                                                distribution with mixed case
                                                (like Paste) and the package
                                                with lower case (like paste).

                                                installed, no other process is
                                                necessary. But the Installation
                                                Format is more general. To have
                                                an egg installed, you either

                                                This is an alternative to
                                                easy_install. It works
                                                <em>somewhat</em> differently
                                                than easy_install, but not much.
                                                Mostly it is
                                                <em>better</em> than
                                                easy_install, in that it has
                                                some extra features and is
                                                easier to use. Unlike
                                                easy_install, it downloads all
                                                distributions up-front, and
                                                generates the metadata to read
                                                distribution and version
                                                requirements. It uses Setuptools
                                                to generate this metadata from a
                                                setup.py file, and uses
                                                pkg_resources to parse this
                                                metadata. It then installs
                                                packages

                                                I&#8217;ve heard the many
                                                complaints about easy_install
                                                (and I&#8217;ve had many
                                                myself), but ultimately I think
                                                pip does well by just fixing a
                                                few small issues. Pip is
                                                <em>not</em> a repudiation of
                                                Setuptools or the basic
                                                mechanisms that easy_install
                                                uses.

                                                had some of the features of pip

                                                but used easy_install for

                                                different library versions,
                                                because for any one environment
                                                you will probably only need one
                                                version of a library. On any one
                                                <em>machine</em> you probably
                                                need different versions, which
                                                is why installing packages
                                                system-wide is problematic for
                                                most libraries. (I&#8217;ve been
                                                meaning to write a post on why I
                                                think using system packaging for
                                                libraries is counter-productive,
                                                but that&#8217;ll wait for
                                                another time.)

                                            So&#8230; there&#8217;s the pieces
                                            involved, at least the ones I can
                                            remember now. And I haven&#8217;t
                                            really discussed .pth files, entry
                                            points, sys.path trickery, site.py,
                                            distutils.cfg&#8230; sadly this is a
                                            complex state of affairs, but it was
                                            also complex before Setuptools.

                                            There are a few things that I think
                                            people really dislike about
                                            Setuptools.
                                        </p>

                                            First, zip files. Setuptools prefers
                                            zip files, for reasons that
                                            won&#8217;t mean much to you, and
                                            maybe are more historical than
                                            anything. When a distribution
                                            doesn&#8217;t indicate if it is
                                            zip-safe, Setuptools looks at the
                                            code and sees if it uses
                                            <tt class="docutils literal"
                                                ><span class="pre"
                                                    >__file__</span
                                                ></tt
                                            >, an if not it presumes that the
                                            code is probably zip-safe. The
                                            specific problem James cites is what
                                            appears to be a bug in Django, that
                                            Django looks for code and
                                            can&#8217;t traverse into zip files
                                            in the same way that Python itself
                                            can. Setuptools didn&#8217;t itself
                                            add anything to Python to make it
                                            import zip files, that functionality
                                            was added to Python some time
                                            before. The zipped eggs that
                                            Setuptools installs are using
                                            existing (standard!) Python
                                            functionality.

                                        <p>
                                            That said, I don&#8217;t think
                                            zipping libraries up is all that
                                            useful, and while it
                                            <em>should</em> work, it
                                            doesn&#8217;t always, and it makes
                                            code harder to inspect and
                                            understand. So since it&#8217;s not
                                            that useful, I&#8217;ve disabled it
                                            when pip installs packages. I also
                                            have had it disabled on my own
                                            system for years now, by creating a
                                            <tt class="docutils literal"
                                                ><span class="pre"

                                            file with
                                            <tt class="docutils literal"

                                            in it. Sadly App Engine is forcing
                                            me to use zip files again, because
                                            of its absurdly small file

                                            and Setuptools. Indeed it is easy to
                                            get things messed up, and it is easy
                                            to piss people off by
                                            overspecifying, and sometimes things
                                            can get in a weird state for no good
                                            reason (often because of
                                            easy_install&#8217;s rather naive

                                            order). Pip fixes that last point,
                                            but it also tries to suggest more
                                            constructive and less painful ways
                                            to manage other pieces.

                                            viewed as an assertion that by

                                            everything <em>will</em> work, just
                                            that it <em>might</em> work. Only
                                            the end developer, testing the

                                            There&#8217;s also a lot of
                                            conflicts between Setuptools and
                                            package maintainers. This is kind of
                                            a proxy war between developers and
                                            sysadmins, who have very different
                                            motivations. It deserves a post of
                                            its own, but the conflicts are about
                                            more than just how Setuptools is
                                            implemented.

                                            I&#8217;d love if there was a
                                            language-neutral library
                                            installation and management tool
                                            that really worked. Linux system
                                            package managers are absolutely not
                                            that tool; frankly it is absurd to
                                            even consider them as an
                                            alternative. So for now we do our
                                            best in our respective language
                                            communities. If we&#8217;re going to
                                            move forward, we&#8217;ll have to
                                            acknowledge what&#8217;s come
                                            before, and the reasoning for it.
