                                            Several times they talk about how
                                            small matters of respect lead to
                                            violence. The conclusion is that
                                            guns are the problem.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            I don&#8217;t really know what to do
                                            with this. In <em>my</em> life (and
                                            I suspect all of your lives) issues
                                            of respect do not lead to violence.
                                            As a result I have a hard time
                                            thinking of this as a gun problem.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            OK, so it&#8217;s a violence
                                            problem. The other thing that gets
                                            me is there&#8217;s this strong
                                            undertone to this conversation that
                                            &quot;we aren&#8217;t doing
                                            enough.&quot; This attitude is of
                                            course the norm for an NPR show. But
                                            it&#8217;s <em>not</em>
                                            <strong>we</strong> &#8212; I, and
                                            everyone I know is not part of this
                                            <strong>we</strong>. My
                                            &quot;we&quot; does not resort to
                                            violence. My &quot;we&quot; does not
                                            project respect into minor social
                                            interactions. When I say it&#8217;s
                                            not &quot;we&quot;, I don&#8217;t
                                            think it&#8217;s just that I tuned
                                            into the wrong radio show &#8212; am
                                            I being recruited into this
                                            &quot;we&quot;? Do they really think
                                            listeners are part of this
                                            &quot;we&quot;?

                                            There is no reflection in these
                                            shows about why
                                            <em>this</em> (whatever the issue of
                                            the show) is a general problem. Of
                                            course most talk shows tend to
                                            generalize wildly, to turn every
                                            anecdote into a sign of some change
                                            in culture, some disease of our
                                            society, something more than just an
                                            anecdote. (Though

                                            There&#8217;s a strong attitude, in
                                            this show and others, that this is a
                                            problem for us all to solve. Why
                                            exactly is this a problem for me to
                                            solve? Why is this a problem for
                                            government to solve? (I&#8217;m not
                                            a conservative, but I feel
                                            it&#8217;s unfair that only
                                            conservatives seem to be able to ask
                                            that question: why should government
                                            solve this?)
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            I don&#8217;t ask these questions
                                            rhetorically (and maybe that makes
                                            me different from the conservatives,
                                            who tend to only ask questions
                                            rhetorically). There may be a good
                                            answer to these questions. But
                                            it&#8217;s far too easy to say
                                            &quot;we must do something about
                                            this&quot; without saying
                                            <em>who</em> and <em>why</em>. We
                                            (especially those of us who listen
                                            to NPR) are all far too fatigued
                                            with the constant admonitions that
                                            not enough is being done, and
                                            something has to change. This kind
                                            of approach is not an effective call
                                            to action.

                                            So, I was at a university the other
                                            day, talking with some people about
                                            a sprint project, and there was a
                                            student there. He was somewhat eager
                                            to write &quot;algorithms&quot;.
                                            I&#8217;m not sure what that means
                                            exactly, but I was reminded of him
                                            because I was just about to write a
                                            function to make an absolute path
                                            relative and this somehow felt like
                                            an &quot;algorithm&quot;.
                                            That&#8217;s not how I&#8217;d
                                            describe most of the coding I do.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            But I digress&#8230; this student
                                            seemed to be excited about his
                                            ability. Well, okay, young
                                            programmers tend to be very eager,
                                            and often overestimate their ability
                                            (or the difficulty of the task). For
                                            students in this position I think
                                            it&#8217;s good to let them take on
                                            large projects, so they can get a
                                            better concept of their ability.
                                            This student seemed to take to heart
                                            the idea that a typical programmer
                                            produces 10 lines of working code a
                                            day. People who hear this are
                                            inclined to think &quot;damn, I can
                                            write way more than 10 lines of code
                                            a day!&quot;
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            I suspect a more fair way of
                                            thinking about this is that on
                                            average a programmer gets 50 lines
                                            of code into production a week, or
                                            200 lines a month. Sure, lots of
                                            people are more productive than
                                            this, but the actual lines of code
                                            that go into production are usually
                                            way smaller than it feels like
                                            during the process that goes into
                                            getting that code there. That
                                            student had probably never gotten a
                                            single line of code into production.
                                            I&#8217;m pretty sure he
                                            wouldn&#8217;t have appreciated what
                                            that getting code into production is
                                            different than just hacking out some
                                            code.

                                            around. I don&#8217;t think we had
                                            any algorithms for him. That&#8217;s
                                            too bad, maybe he could have seen
                                            what programming really looks like.

                                            and editing some templates to change
                                            the feed URL. It didn&#8217;t work,
                                            and I took a look at it and showed
                                            her that somehow a space had gotten
                                            into the URL, so she had to go back
                                            and correct them all. She found this
                                            frustrating. I pointed out to her
                                            that this is exactly what I spend my
                                            days doing.

                                            Some people seem angered when people
                                            call writing HTML
                                            &quot;programming&quot;. Personally
                                            I do not. Most programming is a lot
                                            more like writing HTML than
                                            it&#8217;s like writing a compiler.
                                            I bet writing a compiler is a lot
                                            more like writing HTML than what
                                            most programmers think it&#8217;s
                                            like to write a compiler.

                                                Also thinking of a nice, simple
                                                mass-action for discouraging the
                                                SUV-ites. Simple, direct; when
                                                you see someone driving an SUV,
                                                slowly shake your head in
                                                disappointment and disgust at
                                                the stupidity of the driver.
                                                Throw in a disgusted sneer and
                                                snort if you like. It&#8217;s
                                                not necessarily the driver that
                                                you&#8217;re targeting, the
                                                people around you are probably

                                            Well, a rather pedestrian level of
                                            hate as environmental discussions
                                            go.

                                            I hate SUVs too. There&#8217;s a
                                            very small number of people who have
                                            good reason to own an SUV. Everyone
                                            else should own a normal car or a
                                            minivan (more practical in all the
                                            ways that matter, it just
                                            doesn&#8217;t look as cool). OK, the
                                            irony is that the minivan
                                            isn&#8217;t going to be much more
                                            efficient, it&#8217;s just that
                                            I&#8217;ll trust you have
                                            <em>good reason</em> to own a big
                                            vehicle, because you&#8217;ll have
                                            weighed the utility against the
                                            supreme uncoolness of a minivan. And
                                            anyway, four people barreling down
                                            the highway in a minivan is more
                                            efficient than one person in a
                                            Prius. With an SUV I&#8217;ll always
                                            suspect vanity. And what&#8217;s
                                            worse, I won&#8217;t think less of
                                            you just because of the resources
                                            you take up (not just carbon, but
                                            street space, visual, impact,
                                            etc)&#8230; I&#8217;ll also think
                                            less of you because I&#8217;ll have
                                            you pegged as a dumb consumer. And
                                            don&#8217;t give me any bullshit
                                            about getting around in the snow
                                            &#8212; then I&#8217;ll just peg you
                                            as a lousy driver, because
                                            I&#8217;ve been driving out of snow
                                            drifts in crappy low-clearance
                                            underpowered cars all my life
                                            without much trouble.

                                            But I digress. Yeah, SUVs are shit.
                                            So what does it matter if I think
                                            so? I can only not buy an SUV so
                                            many times. If I don&#8217;t buy a
                                            <em>million</em> SUVs will I have
                                            saved the world? No. So, like Mike I
                                            wish I could get
                                            <em>other</em> people not to buy
                                            SUVs. I&#8217;ve considered tagging
                                            SUVs with

                                            more than piss some people off? If I
                                            make some soccer-mom type feel
                                            guilty, will I have actually
                                            accomplished anything? I think
                                            she&#8217;s a stupid consumer, and
                                            probably self-centered in her
                                            choice, but do I actually want that
                                            person to feel bad, or mad, or
                                            unjustly accused? The only outcome I
                                            can think of is some negative
                                            reaction, and <em>maybe</em> that
                                            reaction could be productive. But
                                            probably not.

                                            The idea really fell apart as I
                                            reflected on all the Hispanic people
                                            in their SUVs going to the Catholic
                                            church next door, and realized that
                                            if I tagged one of their SUVs it
                                            would probably be even more
                                            pointless. This was their symbol of
                                            success, and you certainly
                                            can&#8217;t fault them for getting a
                                            big vehicle if they are filling it
                                            up, even if their particular choice
                                            of SUV was just a reflection of
                                            cowboy dreams &#8212; but when they
                                            bought the SUV instead of the
                                            minivan they only wasted some money,
                                            they didn&#8217;t really do any
                                            worse for the world.

                                            But getting beyond the particulars
                                            of SUVs, I feel environmentalism has
                                            a real problem. It is built on
                                            guilt. A

                                            rational direct action. Personal
                                            effort can result in the improvement
                                            of your personal space. But global
                                            warming? Personal action
                                            doesn&#8217;t do anything, it
                                            can&#8217;t do anything. All we have
                                            is guilt, a sense of collective
                                            responsibility, fear over some
                                            collective doom.

                                            Guilt is a crappy foundation for a
                                            movement. One thing our commercial
                                            and consumerist world has going for
                                            it: there&#8217;s no guilt. The
                                            salesman won&#8217;t question why
                                            you are buying something. It&#8217;s
                                            always &quot;thank you sir, have a
                                            nice day!&quot; And even though
                                            sophisticated people will mock the
                                            insincerity of the expression,
                                            we&#8217;re still human and a kind
                                            word and a smile still makes us feel
                                            better, no matter how our rational
                                            mind rejects it.

                                            But environmentalism? The most
                                            common reactions to guilt are
                                            avoidance, procrastination,
                                            resentment. Guilt is a
                                            <em>horrible</em> way to achieve
                                            action. <em>Judgment</em> can be a
                                            way to build group identity, and
                                            environmentalism has achieved this.
                                            It means something to be an
                                            &quot;environmentalist&quot;. But
                                            that&#8217;s hardly the goal, is it?

                                            People <em>want</em> to do the right
                                            thing for the world. They want to
                                            stop global warming, they want to
                                            reduce pollution, save wildlife, all
                                            that stuff. All the surveys show
                                            this. We&#8217;re not going to get
                                            any closer to consensus (on
                                            <em>goals</em>) than we are already.
                                            If we, collectively and
                                            individually, are still not doing
                                            what we need to, then it is not for
                                            lack of a collective desire, or even
                                            a lack of education.

                                        <p>
                                            So how do we turn desire into
                                            action? I don&#8217;t think guilt is
                                            a good way to do it. I&#8217;m not
                                            sure I like that path anyway. Is it
                                            an irrational reaction to guilt that
                                            we try to avoid judgment? Is it
                                            irrational that people are drawn to
                                            an environment where they are told
                                            they are good, where they are
                                            accepted, where they can act to
                                            achieve clear goals (even if that is
                                            just a purchase), where they can
                                            succeed? Consumerism may only draw
                                            people to an unimpressive local
                                            maximum of happiness, but it always
                                            makes the pursuit clear, consumerism
                                            draws you forward, consumerism
                                            offers a clear path.

                                            And even if you choose to accept and
                                            respond to the guilt of
                                            environmentalism, it won&#8217;t
                                            stop. First you turn the water off
                                            while you are brushing your teeth.
                                            Then you get rid of the SUV. You
                                            replace your bulbs with CFLs. Are
                                            you ready to get rid of your drier?
                                            Put your thermostat at 60F? Eat
                                            organic? Stop eating meat? Join or
                                            start a co-op? Get a composting
                                            toilet? Go off the grid?
                                            There&#8217;s always more to be
                                            done, there&#8217;s always another
                                            thing to feel guilty about not
                                            doing. It&#8217;s disheartening.

                                            Is there a way environmentalism can
                                            be less depressing? Less
                                            guilt-driven? Less accusing and
                                            judgmental? Can environmentalism be
                                            less dismal, more happy?
                                            Environmentalism is trying to drive
                                            a wedge between what people
                                            <em>want</em> and what they
                                            <em>do</em>. Putting aside moral
                                            arguments, is this an effective way
                                            to make change?
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            Considering my carbon footprint has
                                            only made this worse. Every action
                                            is negative. Everything I do has a
                                            cost. Pursuing carbon neutrality
                                            feels like a pursuit of
                                            non-existence. People are
                                            questioning the growth imperative,
                                            but at least growth has a certain
                                            excitement to it. Do we step into
                                            the future with confidence or fear?
                                            Do we take each step with
                                            trepidation and dread? What a
                                            horrible way to come into contact
                                            with our future selves! I want to
                                            meet all of our future selves with
                                            arms open. Buying shit is a poor
                                            substitute for that optimism. But
                                            dammit, I want to be optimistic. I
                                            don&#8217;t want to just be guilty.

                                            So, today is 9/11. I almost missed
                                            it. It&#8217;s not like it catches
                                            you by surprise, you&#8217;re not
                                            going to forget the date. But
                                            it&#8217;s just been slipping by for
                                            a few years now without much notice.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            As an event it is still very
                                            <em>important</em>. History flowed
                                            from that day. But it doesn&#8217;t
                                            mean anything anymore.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            Remember how everyone was saying, on
                                            those days after 9/11/2001, that
                                            they thought about life differently,
                                            about the things that really
                                            mattered and the things that
                                            didn&#8217;t? A couple years ago I
                                            felt frustrated by how quickly that
                                            seemed to disappear, how quickly
                                            genuine sentiment turned into empty
                                            rhetoric. A few years ago that
                                            transition was frustrating, now the
                                            whole thing seems laughable. The
                                            death of irony? No&#8230; after 9/11
                                            our modern cynicism was down but it
                                            wasn&#8217;t out. It came back
                                            fighting, and a National Sense Of
                                            Grief was no match.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            Whatever. I&#8217;m tired of it
                                            anyway. You win Whatever,
                                            you&#8217;re the champ.

                                                You parse semantic markup in
                                                rich text all the time. When
                                                formatting changes, you apply a
                                                reason. RFC&#8217;s don&#8217;t
                                                capitalize MUST and SHOULD
                                                because the author is thinking
                                                in upper-case versus lower-case.
                                                They&#8217;re putting a strong
                                                emphasis on those words. As a
                                                reader, you take special notice
                                                of those words being formatted
                                                that way and immediately
                                                recognize that they contain a
                                                special importance. So I think

                                            I think the reasoning here is
                                            flawed, in that it supposes that
                                            <em>reflection</em> on how we think
                                            is an accurate way of
                                            <em>describing</em> how we think.

                                            A few years ago I got interested in
                                            cognition for a while and
                                            particularly some of the new
                                            theories on consciousness. One of
                                            the parts that really stuck with me
                                            was the difference in how we think
                                            about thinking, and how thinking
                                            really works (as revealed with
                                            timing experiments). That is, our
                                            conscious thought (the
                                            thinking-about-thinking) happened
                                            after the actual thought; we make up
                                            reasons for our actions when
                                            we&#8217;re challenged, but if we
                                            aren&#8217;t challenged to explain
                                            our actions there&#8217;s no
                                            consciousness at all (of course, you
                                            can challenge yourself to explain
                                            your reasoning &#8212; but you
                                            usually won&#8217;t). And then we
                                            revise history so that our reasoning
                                            precedes our decision, but
                                            that&#8217;s not always very
                                            accurate. This gets around the
                                            infinite-loop problem, where either
                                            there&#8217;s always another level
                                            of meta-consciousness reasoning
                                            about the lower level of
                                            consciousness, or there&#8217;s a
                                            potentially infinite sequence of
                                            <em>whys</em> that have to be
                                            answered for every decision. And of
                                            course sometimes we really
                                            <em>do</em> make rational decisions
                                            and there are several levels of
                                            <em>why</em> answered before we
                                            commit. But this is not the most
                                            common case, and there&#8217;s
                                            always a limit to how much
                                            reflection we can do. There are
                                            always decisions made without
                                            conscious consideration &#8212; if
                                            only to free ourselves to focus on
                                            the important decisions.

                                            And so as both a reader and a
                                            writer, I <em>think</em> in terms of
                                            italic and bold. As a reader and a
                                            writer there is of course
                                            translation from one form to
                                            another. There&#8217;s some idea
                                            inside of me that I want to get out
                                            in my writing, there&#8217;s some
                                            idea outside of me that I want to
                                            understand as a reader. But just
                                            because I <em>can</em> describe some
                                            intermediate form of semantic
                                            meaning, it doesn&#8217;t mean that
                                            that meaning is actually there.
                                            Instead I <em>invent</em> things
                                            like &quot;strong&quot; and
                                            &quot;emphasis&quot; when I&#8217;m
                                            asked to decide why I chose a
                                            particular text style. But the real
                                            decision is intuitive &#8212; I map
                                            directly from my ideas to words on
                                            the page, or vice versa for reading.

                                        <p>
                                            Obviously this is not true for all
                                            markup. But my intuition as both a
                                            reader and a writer about bold and
                                            italic is strong enough that I feel
                                            confident there&#8217;s no
                                            intermediary representation. This is
                                            not unlike the fact I don&#8217;t
                                            consider the phonetics of most words
                                            (though admittedly I did when trying
                                            to spell &quot;phonetics&quot;);
                                            common words are opaque tokens that
                                            I read in their entirety without
                                            consideration of their component
                                            letters. And a good reader reads
                                            text words without consideration of
                                            their vocal equivalents (though as a
                                            writer I read my own writing out
                                            loud&#8230; is that typical?
                                            I&#8217;m guessing it is). A good
                                            reader can of course vocalize if
                                            asked, but that doesn&#8217;t mean
                                            the vocalization is an accurate
                                            representation of their original
                                            reading experience.

                                            I think the use of MUST and SHOULD
                                            in RFCs fits with this theory. By
                                            using all caps they emphasize the
                                            word over the prose, they make the
                                            reader see the words as tokens
                                            unique from &quot;must&quot; and
                                            &quot;should&quot;, with special
                                            meanings that are related to but
                                            also much more strict than their
                                            usual English meaning. The caps are
                                            a way of disturbing our natural way
                                            of determining meaning because they
                                            need a more exact language.

                                            is a small and inexpensive computer,
                                            reminiscent of the Mac Mini but
                                            running Linux. The disk is fairly
                                            small (4Gb flash) and is intended to
                                            serve more as a cache for your
                                            network storage than as your primary
                                            store.

                                            The network store is a frontend on

                                            confusing, because Zonbu is selling
                                            the computer at a price of $99 if
                                            you agree to a two year contract for
                                            storage at $12.95 a month (about
                                            $300 over two years).
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            The underlying S3 storage is pretty
                                            cheap: $0.15 per Gb-month, and
                                            $0.10/$0.18 per Gb-upload/download
                                            (discounts for higher quantities,
                                            which probably Zonbu can get but an
                                            individual user couldn&#8217;t). So
                                            if you are storing, say, 10Gb of
                                            data, and retrieving about 10Gb per
                                            month (including all the syncing,
                                            cache misses, etc), that comes to
                                            about $3 per month. Zonbu costs
                                            between $0.50 and $0.20 per
                                            Gb-month, depending on the plan, and
                                            you pay for capacity, not what you
                                            actually use (S3 only charges for
                                            what you really use). I assume there
                                            are bandwidth limits but they
                                            aren&#8217;t published.

                                            As an aside, I was looking for
                                            backup systems for my dad a few
                                            months ago, and looked at some of
                                            the backup systems that included
                                            network storage. They were often in
                                            the range of $10-20 per month, and
                                            weren&#8217;t very high capacity. I
                                            came upon
                                            <a
                                                class="reference external"

                                                >S3 Backup</a
                                            >, which is a fairly simple Windows
                                            program to upload to S3. The price
                                            of S3 is way better than any of the
                                            other commercial solutions. The
                                            billing and account setup
                                            isn&#8217;t as simple as other
                                            systems (since it&#8217;s not
                                            intended to be), but this seems like
                                            something that should be fixed.
                                            There should be a consumer version
                                            of S3. It could make it easier for
                                            software developers to make services
                                            for people without actually having
                                            to maintain infrastructure. Or maybe
                                            more accurately, it would make this
                                            possible for
                                            <em>open source developers</em>,
                                            since we have no interest in being
                                            the intermediary for anything as
                                            that&#8217;s all liability with no
                                            payoff. (Or maybe it&#8217;s the
                                            opposite &#8212; only by being an
                                            intermediary can you get payoff? The
                                            economics of open source get

                                            Zonbu, as a device and company,
                                            appeals to me. But I can&#8217;t
                                            help but feel frustrated about the
                                            network storage pricing, even though
                                            those prices are completely
                                            reasonable (and it seems without
                                            draconian cancellation fees like
                                            mobile phones). Still there&#8217;s
                                            something about the equation that I
                                            just <em>hate</em> &#8212; loss
                                            leaders, unnecessarily intermediated
                                            transactions, hidden costs, and a
                                            price structure that depends on
                                            people not fully utilizing what they
                                            pay for. And I
                                            <em>really like</em> the S3 pricing
                                            &#8212; you pay for what you use and
                                            the pricing is completely
                                            transparent. What I like about it is
                                            that at no point is Amazon expecting
                                            you to act irrationally, and for
                                            Amazon to profit from your
                                            irrational choices. They
                                            aren&#8217;t expecting you to
                                            reserve more than you need. They
                                            aren&#8217;t going to punish you if
                                            you don&#8217;t reserve enough.
                                        </p>

                                            Another part of why I like
                                            S3&#8242;s structure is that Amazon
                                            (well, Amazon Web Services) owns
                                            this particular space in terms of
                                            services, and it&#8217;s not because
                                            of advertising or because they
                                            cornered the market or used
                                            proprietary anything to restrict
                                            choices or made secret business
                                            deals with anyone. They simply are
                                            providing a service with enough
                                            quality and efficiency that no one
                                            else can compete (at least at the
                                            moment). When quality and efficiency
                                            drives market choices it makes me
                                            feel all fuzzy and capitalist. This
                                            happens infrequently enough that
                                            perhaps I get a little overly
                                            excitable about resellers with
                                            different price structures.

                                            OK, digression. We had this
                                            recycling program in Chicago where
                                            we put our recyclables in blue bags
                                            into the trash, and they pick the
                                            blue bags out of the trash. One
                                            imagines fancy computerized systems.
                                            In reality I think there&#8217;s
                                            just some people who watch trash go
                                            by on a<br />
                                            conveyor belt.

                                            This all seemed fishy, but I hate
                                            waste on principle so I would
                                            dutifully recycled my trash, washed
                                            out containers, all that stuff.
                                            You&#8217;d sometimes hear an
                                            environmentalist criticize the
                                            program because there was little
                                            perceived benefit, and so people
                                            didn&#8217;t actually recycle much.
                                            The system seemed a little
                                            improbable to me too, but then I
                                            also realized that recycling is a
                                            balance and it&#8217;s easy to put
                                            more effort into recycling programs
                                            than is saved through the recycling
                                            itself. So maybe this was efficient,
                                            all things considered.

                                            just what they would give people to
                                            make them stop complaining about
                                            recycling.

                                            The irony is that the
                                            environmentalists didn&#8217;t
                                            complain about the recovery rates
                                            (which always were estimated at a
                                            low amount). They complained about
                                            how many people were recycling. Of
                                            course with a recovery rate that low
                                            it didn&#8217;t <em>matter</em> how
                                            many people were recycling. The
                                            entire program was a total farce.
                                            Now that the program is going away
                                            there doesn&#8217;t seem to be much
                                            anger about how deceptive the
                                            program was, and I don&#8217;t know
                                            if anyone is paying attention to the
                                            actual environmental impact of the
                                            new program.

                                        <p>
                                            Even if they recover the recycling
                                            it might still just be a game.
                                            Recycling is filled with farce.
                                            Metal recycling is great.
                                            That&#8217;s why there&#8217;s
                                            trucks that roam the alleys around
                                            Chicago looking for scrap metal.
                                            There&#8217;s a market and someone
                                            is willing to pay for the results.
                                            There&#8217;s not much of a market
                                            for anything else; maybe some glass,
                                            maybe a little plastic.
                                        </p>

                                            People actually get
                                            <em>angry</em> when recycling
                                            programs restrict the plastics they
                                            will take. It doesn&#8217;t occur to
                                            them that some plastics are simply
                                            garbage. They are worthless, and
                                            moving them around in special
                                            recycling containers just wastes
                                            everyone&#8217;s time. They are
                                            angry because they want to pretend
                                            they aren&#8217;t being wasteful.
                                            They aren&#8217;t getting enough

                                            environment. Biofuels on the whole
                                            seem quite questionable. Brazil has
                                            more efficient ethanol, but
                                            it&#8217;s paired with
                                            deforestation. A similar thing
                                            happens when trees for palm oil
                                            replace natural forests. And of
                                            course in all these cases, if plants
                                            weren&#8217;t grown for fuel then
                                            plants would be grown for some other
                                            purpose. So I can&#8217;t really see
                                            any advantage in terms of CO2
                                            emissions &#8212; and when you
                                            consider the relative inefficiency
                                            compared to attaining fossil fuels,
                                            the net effect of biofuels is

                                            Now that environmental concern is
                                            mainstream I think we need to be on
                                            the watch for environmental theater.
                                            Many of the people who play their
                                            parts in this theater are well
                                            meaning, which can make it awkward.
                                            These are people who believe that
                                            The Important Thing Is To Raise
                                            Awareness. But awareness has been
                                            raised, so the time for that kind of
                                            bullshit is past. Lying about
                                            solutions, exaggerating specific
                                            problems, being fuzzy about facts
                                            &#8212; that&#8217;s always been
                                            bullshit, and I&#8217;ve never found
                                            it acceptable. But it&#8217;s
                                            unfortunately become the norm among
                                            advocates of all sorts in these
                                            times. The irony is that the
                                            advocacy has been done, the case has
                                            been made, enough people are
                                            convinced, but it may be hard to
                                            move beyond the theater to
                                            meaningful action. Especially as the
                                            well-meaning people are replaced
                                            with cynics out to make money.

                                            I&#8217;ve switched my software over
                                            to WordPress. This was long overdue,
                                            as anyone who ever wanted to read
                                            anything at all on this site
                                            probably knows. Sometime I should
                                            really write an article reflecting
                                            on the failures of my previous blog
                                            software. Lets just say that flat
                                            files aren&#8217;t so hot either.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            Now that my software doesn&#8217;t
                                            suck, I have lots of posts I have
                                            been embarrassed to write because
                                            every new post potentially
                                            introduced new people to my crappy
                                            site.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            Hopefully everything is setup
                                            correctly, redirects, archives, and
                                            the new feed.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            My one worry is WordPress comments,
                                            which suck a bit. They
                                            shouldn&#8217;t collect the horrible
                                            quantity of spam that the old site
                                            has, so that&#8217;s good, but I
                                            hate disconnected streams of
                                            comments. I&#8217;ve tried to modify
                                            the theme on this site to be more
                                            roomy, with less of the excessive
                                            whitespace that has become the norm.
                                            I hope this whitespace kick goes the
                                            way of Creating Killer Websites
                                            Using Table Based Layout. I.e.,
                                            it&#8217;ll soon look dated and
                                            everyone will move on. So I hope
                                            you&#8217;ll have more than two
                                            inches of width to comment in.
                                            Honestly I wonder if I should just
                                            ditch WordPress comments and use
                                            something else entirely, like some
                                            kind of forum software and rig in
                                            some way of including the comments
                                            in the theme. I wanted to install
                                            <a
                                                class="reference external"
                                                href="http://meidell.dk/archives/2004/09/04/nested-comments/"
                                                >threaded comments</a
                                            >, but the installation process is
                                            rather invasive.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            For editing I turned TinyMCE off
                                            (ugh), and installed
                                            <a
                                                class="reference external"

                                            >. It took a while to figure out,
                                            since I have to include
                                            <tt class="docutils literal"
                                                ><span class="pre">..</span>
                                                <span class="pre">-*-</span>
                                                <span class="pre">mode:</span>
                                                <span class="pre">rst</span>
                                                <span class="pre">-*-</span></tt
                                            >
                                            in the header of each post. Oh well,
                                            a minor inconvenience. I used
                                            <a
                                                class="reference external"
                                                href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/text-control/"
                                                >Text Control</a
                                            >
                                            to enable Markdown in comments, but
                                            I had to replace the actual
                                            <tt class="docutils literal"
                                                ><span class="pre"
                                                    >markdown.php</span
                                                ></tt
                                            >
                                            it used, which was broken.
