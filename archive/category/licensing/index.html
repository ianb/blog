                                        <p>
                                            I&#8217;ve been programming Python
                                            web software for quite a while now.
                                            I considered coming here and talked
                                            about WSGI, standards,
                                            cross-framework integration, etc.,
                                            but I decided I wanted to come up
                                            here and talk to you as compatriots,
                                            as fellow open source programmers.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            Over the past year or so I have been
                                            thinking a lot about politics. Not
                                            electoral politics per se, or the
                                            geopolitical situation, but the
                                            question of the meaning of what we
                                            are doing. Maybe it is some sort of
                                            programmer midlife crisis: why am I
                                            doing what I&#8217;m doing, and why
                                            does it matter? And also I have been
                                            thinking a lot about open source
                                            &#8212; what this thing that
                                            we&#8217;re doing means in the
                                            larger context. Are we just
                                            engineers? Is there some sort of
                                            movement? If so, what is that
                                            movement? Especially as open source
                                            has become more popular, the sense
                                            of a movement seems to dwindle. It
                                            felt like a movement 10 years ago,
                                            but not as much today. Why should
                                            this happen? Why now, in the midst
                                            of success does open source seem
                                            less politically relevant than it
                                            did 10 years ago?
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            I&#8217;m also speaking somewhat to
                                            Django specifically, as I think it
                                            is one of the communities with a bit
                                            more resistance to the idea of the
                                            politics of code. The Django
                                            philosophy is more: the value of
                                            this code is the value of what you
                                            do with it. I&#8217;m not here to
                                            criticize this perspective, but to
                                            think about how we can find meaning
                                            without relying on the traditional
                                            free software ideas. To see if
                                            there&#8217;s something here that
                                            isn&#8217;t described yet.

                                            I&#8217;d like to start with a quick
                                            history of free and open source
                                            software. My own start was in
                                            highschool where I was taking a
                                            class in which we all used Emacs.
                                            This was my first introduction to
                                            any real sort of programming
                                            environment, to Unix, to a text
                                            editor that was anything to talk
                                            about. At the time Emacs would say
                                            at startup &quot;to learn more about
                                            the GNU project hit Control-H
                                            Control-P&quot; &#8212; because of
                                            course you need a keyboard shortcut
                                            to get to a philosophy statement
                                            about an editor. So one day I hit
                                            Control-H Control-P. I was expecting
                                            to see some sort of About Message,
                                            or if you remember the software of
                                            the times maybe something about
                                            Shareware, or even &quot;if you
                                            really like this software, consider
                                            giving to the Red Cross.&quot; But
                                            instead I came upon the GNU
                                            Manifesto.

                                                    marketing arrangements now
                                                    typically used essentially
                                                    forbid programmers to treat
                                                    others as friends. The
                                                    purchaser of software must

                                                    and obeying the law.
                                                    Naturally, many decide that
                                                    friendship is more
                                                    important. But those who
                                                    believe in law often do not
                                                    feel at ease with either
                                                    choice. They become cynical
                                                    and think that programming

                                                When I read this statement I was
                                                immediate head-over-heels in
                                                love with this concept. As a
                                                teenager, thinking about
                                                programming, thinking about the
                                                world, having a statement that
                                                was so intellectually aggressive
                                                was exciting. It didn&#8217;t
                                                ask: &quot;how wrong is piracy
                                                really&quot;, or &quot;why are
                                                our kids doing this&quot;, but
                                                it asked &quot;is piracy a moral
                                                imperative&quot; &#8212;
                                                that&#8217;s the kind of
                                                aggressive question that feels
                                                revolutionary and passionate.

                                                It wasn&#8217;t saying: what are
                                                we not allowed to do, nor did it
                                                talk about some kind of societal
                                                injustice. It didn&#8217;t talk

                                                their long-term effects. Instead
                                                it asked: what must we do, not
                                                as a society, not in service of
                                                some end, but what are we called

                                                of the people we call friends.
                                                It didn&#8217;t allude to any
                                                sociological explanation,
                                                natural selection, economics;

                                                When I first encountered free
                                                software, I suppose about 15
                                                years ago, this was during one
                                                of the more difficult periods of
                                                its evolution. It was past the
                                                initial excitement, the initial
                                                optimism that the project would
                                                take only a couple years to
                                                reach parity with closed-source
                                                Unix, it was before it was clear
                                                how the project would move
                                                forward. Linux was young and
                                                seemed to be largely off the
                                                radar of Richard Stallman and
                                                other GNU advocates, and they
                                                were struggling to fill in final
                                                key pieces, things like a
                                                kernel, widgets, and they
                                                hadn&#8217;t even thought about
                                                entirely new things like
                                                browsers.

                                                The message that came through
                                                from that period is not the
                                                message I wish came through. The
                                                message I wish came through was
                                                that message from the GNU
                                                Manifesto, that spirit of a new
                                                sense of duty and ability. When
                                                people talk about Richard
                                                Stallman and the Free Software
                                                Foundation and the GNU Project,
                                                they&#8217;ll often point to the
                                                GNU General Public License as
                                                the most important contribution
                                                &#8212; the GPL. I&#8217;m sure
                                                you all know something about it.
                                                Of course the core concept there
                                                is the idea of copyleft. Not
                                                only will the software be open,
                                                but it&#8217;s takes the implied
                                                perspective that the principles
                                                of freedom are rights &#8212;
                                                that unfortunately the world is
                                                not wise enough to see that use,
                                                distribution, and modification
                                                are rights; but the GPL still
                                                asserts that these
                                                <em>are</em> your rights. When
                                                you become one of us, when you
                                                participate in the freedoms this
                                                license grants you, when you use
                                                the GPL, there is encoded in the
                                                license a support for this sense
                                                of the natural right of free
                                                software. We, GNU, can&#8217;t
                                                encode that for the world, but
                                                for the software that we write
                                                these rights are inalienable.

                                                But as I said those were
                                                difficult times. There was a
                                                great deal of pressure. People
                                                were trying to understand what
                                                open source meant. People still
                                                struggle with questions: how
                                                would an economy function, how
                                                would a programmer get a job, if
                                                this is as successful as people
                                                hoped will we all just be out of
                                                jobs? Other questions were: who
                                                will write the software that no
                                                one wants to write? How can I,
                                                embedded in a situation where I
                                                can&#8217;t actually use only
                                                free software &#8212; remember
                                                at this time there was no way to
                                                use completely free software
                                                &#8212; how can I assert a duty
                                                to do something that is not
                                                possible? How can I be useful
                                                unless I interface with all
                                                these proprietary things? If I
                                                deal with companies which
                                                aren&#8217;t comfortable with
                                                open source software, then what?
                                                After all, open source seemed
                                                only barely plausible at this
                                                time. It was not an easy
                                                argument to make.
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                                And all this was before the term
                                                &quot;open source&quot; really
                                                took hold as a distinct idea.
                                                That itself is an interesting
                                                story. There was a time during
                                                this marketing period when there
                                                arose a kind of terminology
                                                divide &#8212; free software vs.
                                                open source software. The
                                                terminology divide was that the
                                                &quot;free&quot; in free
                                                software implied you
                                                couldn&#8217;t charge anything,
                                                that made people think about
                                                price, might even imply
                                                cheapness. Open source directly
                                                refers to programming, uses the
                                                feel-good term &quot;open&quot;,
                                                and doesn&#8217;t sound too
                                                revolutionary. But besides that
                                                there was also a substantial
                                                philosophical difference about
                                                the value of the software
                                                itself.
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                                So there was a difference in how
                                                things were going to be pitched,
                                                but also a difference in what
                                                people thought the general value
                                                of this project was. From GNU
                                                and Richard Stallman there was
                                                the notion that this was right
                                                because it was right; it was a
                                                moral imperative. The virtue of
                                                what we build is in its freedom;
                                                if it is also technically
                                                superior then that&#8217;s
                                                great, but it is not how we
                                                should judge our success. We
                                                were giving people
                                                self-determination: programmer
                                                self-determination, user
                                                self-determination&#8230; on the
                                                open source side the argument
                                                was that this is a good way to
                                                create software. Programmers
                                                working together can do better
                                                work. With many eyes all bugs
                                                are shallow. All working
                                                together, we&#8217;ll work
                                                faster, you get the benefit of
                                                free contributions from all
                                                sorts of people. People were
                                                clamouring to get all these
                                                proprietary companies with
                                                failing software products to
                                                open source their software;
                                                miracles will occur! What you
                                                thought was useless will regain
                                                value! You&#8217;ll reattain
                                                relevance!

                                                The open source and free
                                                software philosophical divide:
                                                on one side practical concerns,
                                                on the other moral. And this is
                                                what I want to talk about later:
                                                can we find a moral argument for
                                                these practical concerns?

                                                The basic free/open disagreement
                                                continues in debates over
                                                licenses: the GPL vs. the BSD
                                                and other permissive licenses.

                                                instructions, and the one line:

                                                doesn&#8217;t say why
                                                you&#8217;ve received this
                                                software, or any philosophy
                                                about rights and freedoms, or
                                                even encourage you to use the

                                                software. An engineer&#8217;s

                                                So these two licenses in many
                                                ways became a focus and
                                                definition of free and open

                                                I think this is disappointing,
                                                because licenses are just law,
                                                and law is not very interesting.
                                                A law tells you what you
                                                shouldn&#8217;t do, it
                                                doesn&#8217;t tell you what you
                                                should do. When both sides are
                                                talking about freedom, the
                                                licenses just define freedom as
                                                the lack of certain
                                                restrictions. Take away those
                                                restrictions and voila, you are
                                                free&#8230; as though we are all
                                                just bundles of freedom waiting
                                                to be released.

                                                With licenses we have a negative
                                                definition of our community.
                                                Either license you choose, the
                                                license feels like a reaction
                                                against closed source software.
                                                If you can imagine a world in
                                                which there was no copyright,
                                                where our platforms were all
                                                setup to distribute source code
                                                in modifiable forms, where
                                                everything was open and
                                                everything was free, then none
                                                of these licenses would matter.
                                                No one would be compelled to
                                                create the GPL in such a world;
                                                we wouldn&#8217;t advocate for
                                                copyright just so we can secure
                                                people&#8217;s freedoms. In that
                                                kind of world all this licensing
                                                disappears. And this isn&#8217;t
                                                even so weird a world. You can
                                                pretend there&#8217;s no
                                                copyright now. Maybe you have to
                                                reverse-engineer some stuff.
                                                There&#8217;s lots of places in
                                                the world where no one really
                                                gives a damn about copyright.
                                                But those places don&#8217;t
                                                feel open source to me, they
                                                don&#8217;t feel that more free.
                                                We aren&#8217;t made unfree just
                                                by legal restrictions; freedom
                                                is something we have to actively
                                                grasp.
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                                I don&#8217;t think what we do
                                                is predicated on copyright.
                                                Indeed, many projects are
                                                comfortable with an entirely
                                                confused copyright ownership.
                                                This causes very few problems. A
                                                focus on licensing makes us into
                                                a reaction against proprietary
                                                software, where we allow
                                                proprietary software and its
                                                makers to define what it means
                                                to be <em>us</em>.
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                                This concerns me because it
                                                isn&#8217;t just about formal
                                                definitions and terminology.
                                                When I say
                                                <em>what do I do</em>, I say I
                                                am an open source programmer.
                                                That&#8217;s not just an
                                                attribute, like saying that my
                                                hair is brown. Open source is a
                                                way in which I see myself, a way
                                                I think about my craft, my
                                                profession, and a way I justify
                                                the work I put out to the world:
                                                that it aligns with these
                                                values. So it&#8217;s very
                                                important to me what these
                                                values are. And it&#8217;s
                                                frustrating to see open source
                                                defined in reaction to closed
                                                source software, because
                                                personally I don&#8217;t care
                                                about closed source software
                                                that much.
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                                I never really cared much about
                                                fighting Microsoft, and I
                                                certainly don&#8217;t care now.
                                                I see myself as a builder; this
                                                is what always drew me towards
                                                programming. The desire to build
                                                new things. This is our
                                                privilege as programmers, that
                                                we always have the opportunity
                                                to build new things. If
                                                we&#8217;re asked to do
                                                something again and again and
                                                again, you always have the power
                                                to do it in a more abstract way,
                                                to generalize it away, until you
                                                can start to ignore the requests
                                                and move on to another problem.
                                                This is something unique thing
                                                to computer programming. These
                                                are the kind of unique
                                                attributes that make us
                                                different as a profession and as
                                                a craft than just about anything
                                                I can think of.

                                            <p>
                                                So I&#8217;m frustrated. Here we
                                                are stuck in this notion of a
                                                license as a self-definition. I
                                                want to find a new
                                                self-definition, a new idea of
                                                what makes us us.

                                                I was saying about Django, the
                                                community is not particularly
                                                enthusiastic about philosophy.
                                                Or maybe I should say,
                                                Django&#8217;s philosophy is:
                                                the value of the code is the
                                                thing you do with it. These
                                                abstract discussions about
                                                architecture, reuse, big
                                                plans&#8230; instead, Django as
                                                a community encourages you to
                                                keep your head in the code,
                                                think about what you want to do,
                                                and then do it. Don&#8217;t

                                                But I&#8217;m not here to tell
                                                you to get philosophical about
                                                freedom, or to berate you for a
                                                functional definition of value.
                                                I&#8217;d like to look at this
                                                community for what it is, and
                                                ask: what is the value system
                                                here? Maybe it isn&#8217;t
                                                described, but I also
                                                don&#8217;t think it is
                                                therefore absent.
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                                So&#8230; when I say I identify
                                                as an open source programmer,
                                                what is it that I am identifying
                                                as?
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                                I don&#8217;t believe licensing
                                                makes something truly open
                                                source. There was this clamour
                                                in the past to get companies to
                                                open source their products. This
                                                has stopped, because all the
                                                software that got open source
                                                sucked. It&#8217;s just not very
                                                interesting to have a closed
                                                source program get open sourced.
                                                It doesn&#8217;t help anyone,
                                                because the way closed source
                                                software is created in a very
                                                different way than open source
                                                software. The result is a
                                                software base that just does not
                                                engage people in a way to make
                                                it a valid piece of software for
                                                further development. At least
                                                not unless you have something
                                                peculiar going on&#8230; an
                                                economic force like you had
                                                behind Mozilla that could push
                                                things forward even in the midst
                                                of all the problems that project
                                                had. One might even ask, is
                                                Mozilla still suffering from
                                                that proprietary background,
                                                when something like KHTML or
                                                WebKit which came from a truly
                                                open source background, and has
                                                been a more successful basis for
                                                collaboration and new work.
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                                So whatever it is that makes
                                                something open source,
                                                it&#8217;s not just licensing.
                                                Given a codebase, we can&#8217;t
                                                necessarily expect that someone
                                                going to care about it and love
                                                it and make it successful. A lot
                                                of people have described what
                                                makes a successful open source
                                                codebase; I&#8217;d like to talk
                                                some about what the communities
                                                look like.

                                            <hr class="docutils" />
                                            <p>
                                                Open source works as a fairly
                                                loose federation of people
                                                together. Everyone involved is
                                                involved as an individual.
                                                Companies seldom participate
                                                directly in open source.
                                                Companies might use open source,
                                                they might sponsor people to
                                                work on open source projects,
                                                they might ask an employee to
                                                act as a liason. But it&#8217;s
                                                not cool to submit a bug as a
                                                company. You submit it as
                                                yourself. If someone asks a
                                                question, you answer as
                                                yourself. You don&#8217;t join a
                                                mailing list under the
                                                company&#8217;s name. And even
                                                when you put a company name on a
                                                product, it&#8217;s hard to
                                                relate to the product as a
                                                <em>project</em> without some
                                                sense of authorship, of the
                                                underlying individual.

                                                There&#8217;s also very little
                                                money being moved about.
                                                There&#8217;s not a lot of
                                                commercial contracts. You might
                                                get software, you might get bug
                                                fixes, you might get reputation,
                                                but there&#8217;s seldom any
                                                formal way setup to introduce
                                                commerce into the community. How
                                                many projects let you pay to
                                                escalate a bug? Even if everyone
                                                involved might like that,
                                                it&#8217;s just not there.

                                                But I want to get back to
                                                individuals. How things are
                                                created is not that someone
                                                determines a set of priorities,
                                                lays them out, then people work
                                                on implementation based on those
                                                priorities. That of course is
                                                how things typically work at a
                                                company, as an employee. But
                                                open source software and open
                                                source projects are created
                                                because an individual looks at
                                                the world and sees an
                                                opportunity to create something
                                                they think should exist. Maybe
                                                it resolves a tension
                                                they&#8217;ve felt in their
                                                work, maybe it allows that
                                                person to respond to the
                                                priorities from above better,
                                                but the decision to implement
                                                lies primarily with the
                                                implementor. When someone makes
                                                a decision to move a product
                                                from simply private code &#8212;
                                                regardless of the license
                                                &#8212; to being a real open
                                                source project, that decision is
                                                almost always driven by the
                                                programmer.

                                                Underneath most open source work
                                                there is a passion for the craft
                                                itself. This is what leads to a
                                                certain kind of quality that is
                                                not the norm in closed source
                                                software. It&#8217;s not
                                                necessarily less bugs or more
                                                features, but a pride in the
                                                expression itself. A sense of
                                                aesthetic that applies to even
                                                the individual lines of
                                                software, not just to the
                                                functionality produced. This
                                                kind of aesthetic defies
                                                scheduling and relies on
                                                personal motivation.

                                                As open source programmers we
                                                are not first concerned with how
                                                a task fits into institutions,
                                                how a task can be directed by a
                                                hierarchy or an authority, or
                                                even how the task can be
                                                directed by economics. The tasks
                                                that we take on are motivated by
                                                aesthetic, by personal
                                                excitement and drive.

                                                We are also in a profession
                                                where there is little stasis. If
                                                you can create something once,
                                                you can create it a thousand
                                                times, through iteration or
                                                abstraction. You can constantly
                                                make your own effort obsolete. A
                                                good programmer is always trying
                                                to work themselves out of a job.

                                                Djangocon didn&#8217;t exist a
                                                couple years ago. Django
                                                didn&#8217;t exist only a few
                                                years ago. And I don&#8217;t
                                                think there&#8217;s anyone here
                                                who thinks that, having found
                                                Django, they&#8217;ve reached
                                                some terminal point. It&#8217;s
                                                hardly even a point to pause.
                                                There&#8217;s a constant churn,
                                                a constant push forward that
                                                we&#8217;re all participating
                                                in.
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                                As a result it&#8217;s demanded
                                                of us that we have a tight
                                                feedback cycle, that education
                                                is not a formal affair but a
                                                constant process in our own
                                                work. There&#8217;s a constant
                                                churn, and a professional sense
                                                we&#8217;re kind of like fruit
                                                flies. A generation of knowledge
                                                and practice is short enough
                                                that the evolution is rapid and
                                                visible. You don&#8217;t have to
                                                be particularly old or even
                                                thoughtful to see the changes.
                                                You can look back even on your
                                                own work and on communities to
                                                see changes over the course of a
                                                couple years, to see changes and
                                                shifts and a maturing of the
                                                work and the community.

                                                Another attribute of open
                                                source: our communities are ad
                                                hoc and temporary. We do not
                                                overvalue these communities and
                                                institutions; we regularly
                                                migrate, split, recombine, and
                                                we constantly rewrite. There is
                                                both an arrogance and a humility
                                                to this. We are arrogant to
                                                think This Time Will Be
                                                Different. But we are humble
                                                enough to know that last time
                                                wasn&#8217;t different either.
                                                There will always be a next
                                                thing, another technique,
                                                another vision.

                                                Because of the ad hoc nature of
                                                the communities, we don&#8217;t
                                                have long collective plans. The
                                                ad hoc community may be the
                                                intersection of different
                                                <em>personal</em> long range
                                                plans, a time when different
                                                visions somehow coincide in a
                                                similar implementation. Or
                                                perhaps it&#8217;s just
                                                serendipity, or leadership. But
                                                we make each decision anew. I
                                                believe this protects us from
                                                being misled by sunk costs. The
                                                idea of a sunk cost is that when
                                                you make an investment,
                                                you&#8217;ve put in effort, that
                                                effort is gone. Just because
                                                you&#8217;ve put in effort
                                                doesn&#8217;t mean you&#8217;ve
                                                received value, or that the path
                                                of investment remains valid. But
                                                as humans we are highly
                                                reluctant to let go of a plan
                                                that we&#8217;ve invested in. We
                                                have a hard time recognizing
                                                sunk costs.

                                                I believe in our developer
                                                community we approach our work
                                                with sufficient humility that we
                                                can see our work as simply a
                                                sunk cost. Our effort does not
                                                entitle us to any particular
                                                success, so we can choose new
                                                directions with more rationality
                                                than an institution. Though it
                                                can also be argued that we are
                                                too quick to dismiss past
                                                investments; there is a
                                                youthfulness even to our oldest
                                                members.

                                                veto power (a BDFL), but no one
                                                has <em>executive</em> power. A
                                                decision only is valid paired
                                                with an implementation. You
                                                cannot decide something based on
                                                information you
                                                <em>wish</em> was true; you
                                                cannot decide on something then
                                                blame the implementors for
                                                getting it wrong. We are in this
                                                sense vertically integrated,
                                                decision and implementation are
                                                combined. The result may be
                                                success or failure, commitment
                                                or abandonment, but the
                                                hierarchy is flat and the
                                                feedback loop is very tight. And
                                                if an individual feels stymied,
                                                there is always another
                                                community to join or create.

                                                Though this is only a start,
                                                it&#8217;s these attributes that
                                                I would prefer define us, not
                                                licenses.

                                                I also would like that this
                                                could be a model for how other
                                                work should be done.

                                            <h2>Why Us?</h2>
                                            <p>
                                                Why would we, as programmers, be
                                                unique or worthy of emulation? I
                                                mentioned before that we
                                                constantly work ourselves out of
                                                our job. We also create the
                                                tools we use to do the work. We
                                                define the structure of our
                                                communities. We&#8217;re
                                                consistently finding novel ways
                                                to use the internet build those
                                                communities. It&#8217;s not that
                                                we as a group are somehow
                                                uniquely wise, or some Greatest
                                                Generation, but we have become
                                                distinctly self-empowered. There
                                                is a uniqueness to us. It might
                                                be a coincidence of history, but
                                                it is there.
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                                A question I might then ask: is
                                                there a political meaning to
                                                this? This is the form our craft
                                                takes, but does that mean
                                                anything? We work with
                                                computers, someone else might
                                                work with their hands, an artist
                                                considers color, a salesperson
                                                learns how to put on a good
                                                smile.

                                            <p>
                                                I haven&#8217;t quite figured
                                                this out yet, but I think
                                                there&#8217;s something in this.
                                                Over the years I&#8217;ve found
                                                myself looking at politics in a
                                                increasingly technocratic lens;
                                                more so than as a liberal,
                                                conservative, or radical. That
                                                is, instead of looking at the
                                                world and seeing what&#8217;s
                                                wrong about it, and explaining
                                                it in terms of a class struggle,
                                                a cultural conflict, in terms of
                                                advocacy or invented enemies or
                                                allies, I see a system that just
                                                works how it works. It&#8217;s
                                                more like gears than like a war.
                                                The gears turn and sometimes we
                                                don&#8217;t like what results,
                                                but it&#8217;s not malice.
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                                But I also don&#8217;t think we
                                                are slaves to the technical
                                                functioning of the system. None
                                                of us are inevitably caught up
                                                in some statistical outcome of
                                                markets, or condemned by money
                                                in politics or advertising. At
                                                any time we can say Here Is What
                                                I Believe, and it is as powerful
                                                as any of those other things;
                                                we&#8217;re too quick to look at
                                                the people who aren&#8217;t
                                                asserting a belief, who
                                                aren&#8217;t asserting their own
                                                potential for self-empowerment
                                                and direction, and we ignore
                                                everyone who is aware and
                                                concerned and attempting
                                                self-determination. We are at
                                                danger of ignoring the great
                                                potential around us.
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                                It is in this sense that I
                                                wonder not just how we can
                                                spread the idea of freedom
                                                through licensing, which has
                                                inspired the free culture
                                                movement, but also how we can
                                                spread this idea and practice of
                                                individual action, of combining
                                                decision and implementation, and
                                                of constant ad hoc
                                                collaboration.
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                                I&#8217;m not just thinking of
                                                politics directly, but of
                                                professional lives as well.
                                                Right now we&#8217;re talking
                                                about healthcare. It&#8217;s a
                                                very political issue, and yet
                                                healthcare is ultimately a
                                                profession, a job, an action.
                                                How we work on that,
                                                collaboratively or not, is as
                                                political as any aspect of the
                                                system.
                                            </p>

                                                One anecdote that made me think
                                                about this, is a task I had that
                                                involved putting authentication
                                                in front of a mailing list. The
                                                mailing list happened to be for
                                                wound, ostomy, and continence
                                                nurses, and in the process of
                                                the job I read a bunch of their
                                                emails from the archives. As
                                                wound nurses they spent a lot of
                                                time asking about specific
                                                questions &#8212; maybe a wound
                                                that wouldn&#8217;t heal, they
                                                kept draining the puss and it
                                                discharge kept reappearing, and
                                                did anyone have ideas of the
                                                next technique to try?
                                            </p>

                                                Reading a few of these I could
                                                tell this was a profession where
                                                you needed a strong stomach. But
                                                the whole interaction, the way
                                                they described problems, the way
                                                people came back with answers,
                                                it felt very familiar to me. It
                                                was the same kind of discussions
                                                I could imagine having about
                                                Linux administration or
                                                debugging. And the goals were
                                                similar. No one was making
                                                money, there wasn&#8217;t really
                                                reputation on the line, it was
                                                just people who wanted to help
                                                their patients and who wanted to
                                                help each other.

                                                So that mailing list was great,
                                                but it&#8217;s unfortunately not
                                                that common. And if nurses were
                                                open to that kind of
                                                collaboration, doctors
                                                don&#8217;t seem nearly as
                                                ready. And there&#8217;s a lot
                                                of professions where
                                                there&#8217;s not even that
                                                thoughtfulness. I believe in any
                                                profession there&#8217;s the
                                                ability to do it well or not;
                                                there&#8217;s nothing so rote or
                                                well understood that
                                                there&#8217;s no room for
                                                improvement. It doesn&#8217;t
                                                have to be fancy technology, it
                                                can just be a technique, a way
                                                of managing work; all things
                                                worth doing have some way of
                                                improving, by bringing in this
                                                same sense of collaboration and
                                                individual action and
                                                thoughtfulness, all things can
                                                be implemented better than they
                                                are now. What I&#8217;m
                                                describing isn&#8217;t a fancy
                                                new website for professionals,
                                                but about people look at their
                                                own work differently; the
                                                technology is not the hard part.

                                                Changing how people look at
                                                their work I think is political.
                                                It involves individual
                                                empowerment. It can mean
                                                economic change. I also think it
                                                deemphasizes competition. When I
                                                think about Pylons, or Django,
                                                or TurboGears, or WSGI,
                                                there&#8217;s competition, but
                                                it&#8217;s also collegial.
                                                There&#8217;s not really that
                                                much of a sense of survival. We
                                                aren&#8217;t carving out
                                                territories, we&#8217;re just
                                                finding paths to some unknown
                                                end. If something else wins out,
                                                well, we&#8217;re all just along
                                                for the ride. In the end it is
                                                inevitable that something else
                                                other than what <em>any</em> of
                                                us are working on will win out
                                                over what any of us are doing.
                                                Just like everyone eventually
                                                loses their job at least to
                                                death or retirement.
                                                There&#8217;s no permanency. But
                                                if we can be individually more
                                                productive, it doesn&#8217;t
                                                have to mean we&#8217;ve put
                                                someone else out. It
                                                <em>could</em> mean we all, all
                                                of society, all of humanity,
                                                just do <em>more</em>. Why do we
                                                have to set ourselves against
                                                the Chinese, or Europe against
                                                the U.S.? Why do we have to set
                                                ourselves one economy against
                                                another?

                                                Or consider government itself:
                                                we&#8217;re obsessed with our
                                                elected officials, but of course
                                                government is far larger than
                                                just the elected officials. The
                                                U.S. Federal Government alone
                                                has 1.8 million employees. We
                                                constantly threaten to institute
                                                accountability, meaning that
                                                we&#8217;ll poke and prod
                                                government workers from the
                                                outside and expect better
                                                outcomes. That we expect
                                                anything to come of this is
                                                absurd, but somehow
                                                accountability has become an
                                                easy alternative to constructive
                                                suggestions for improvement.
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                                But why shouldn&#8217;t we
                                                expect that government workers
                                                <em>want</em> to do better? I
                                                believe in fact those people
                                                doing the work are especially
                                                well equiped to figure out
                                                <em>how</em> to do better. But
                                                it&#8217;s not automatic. They
                                                aren&#8217;t empowered in a
                                                system that is so exceptionally
                                                hierarchical. Lately we&#8217;ve
                                                seen lots of efforts to ask the
                                                public how to do government work
                                                better, but we&#8217;ve seen
                                                nothing asking
                                                <em>government</em> how to do
                                                government work better.

                                                These are the kinds of things
                                                I&#8217;d like to see us all
                                                think about more: open source
                                                has done incredible things, has
                                                inspired new ideas, about more
                                                than just software and
                                                engineering, but I think we have
                                                yet more things to give.
                                            </p>
                                            <p>Thank you for your time.</p>
