                                            There&#8217;s a new site:
                                            <a

                                            >; not notably different than the
                                            old site, just a new name. The
                                            product is self-hosting now, using a
                                            <a
                                                class="reference external"

                                            that runs after every commit to
                                            regenerate the docs, and with a
                                            small extension to Silver Lining
                                            itself (to make it easier to host
                                            static files). Now that it has a
                                            real name I also gave it a
                                            <a

                                            Silver Lining also has its
                                            <a

                                            test. I&#8217;m hoping with a
                                            <a
                                                class="reference external"

                                            that a full integration test can run
                                            in a reasonable amount of time.
                                            <em>Some</em> unit tests would be
                                            possible, but so far most of the
                                            bugs have been interaction bugs so I
                                            think integration tests will have to
                                            pull most of the weight. (A
                                            continuous integration rig will be
                                            very useful; I am not sure if Silver
                                            Lining can self-host that, though
                                            it&#8217;d be nice/clever if it
                                            could.)

                                            I have a somewhat different
                                            perspective on the topic.

                                            might display that perspective. You
                                            should go read

                                            I&#8217;ve just manually handled
                                            validation here. I don&#8217;t feel
                                            like doing it with FormEncode.
                                            Manual validation isn&#8217;t that
                                            big a deal; FormEncode would just
                                            produce the same
                                            <tt class="docutils literal"
                                                ><span class="pre"
                                                    >errors</span
                                                ></tt
                                            >
                                            dictionary anyway. In this case (as
                                            in many form validation cases) you
                                            can&#8217;t do better than
                                            hand-written validation code:
                                            it&#8217;s shorter, more
                                            self-contained, and easier to tweak.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            After validation the template is

                                            Note that the only &quot;logic&quot;
                                            here is to render the form to
                                            include fields for all the
                                            questions. Obviously this produces
                                            an ugly form, but it&#8217;s
                                            <em>very obvious</em> how you make
                                            this form pretty, and how to tweak
                                            it in any way you might want. Also
                                            if you have deeper dynamicism (e.g.,
                                            <tt class="docutils literal"
                                                ><span class="pre"

                                            >
                                            start returning the type of response
                                            required, or weird validation, or
                                            whatever) it&#8217;s
                                            <em>very obvious</em> where that
                                            change would go: display logic goes
                                            in the form, validation logic goes
                                            in that validate function.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            This just gives you the raw form.
                                            You wouldn&#8217;t need a template
                                            at all if it wasn&#8217;t for the
                                            dynamicism. Everything else is added
                                            when the form is &quot;filled&quot;:
                                        </p>

                                            you might read the defaults out of a

                                            form. And errors are just handled
                                            automatically, inserted into the
                                            HTML with appropriate CSS classes.

                                            accept that the world has actually
                                            become simpler, not more
                                            complicated, and that there is
                                            knowledge worth forgetting (forms
                                            are so freakin&#8217; stupid!) If at
                                            all possible, dodging complexity is
                                            far better than cleverly responding
                                            to complexity.

                                            I haven&#8217;t received a great
                                            deal of <em>specific</em> feedback
                                            on toppcloud
                                            (<strong>update</strong>: renamed
                                            Silver Lining), only a few people
                                            (Ben Bangert, Jorge Vargas) seem to
                                            have really dived deeply into it.
                                            But &#8212; and this is not
                                            unexpected &#8212; I have already
                                            gotten several requests about making
                                            it more agnostic with respect
                                            to&#8230; stuff. Maybe that it not
                                            (at least forever) require Ubuntu.
                                            Or maybe that it should support
                                            different process models (e.g.,
                                            threaded and multiple processes). Or
                                            other versions of Python.

                                        <p>
                                            The more I think about it, and the
                                            more I work with the tool, the more
                                            confident I am that toppcloud should
                                            not be agnostic on these issues.
                                            This is not so much about an
                                            &quot;opinionated&quot; tool;
                                            toppcloud is not actually very
                                            opinionated. It&#8217;s about a
                                            well-understood system.
                                        </p>

                                            For instance, Ben noticed a problem
                                            recently with
                                            <a
                                                class="reference external"
                                                href="http://code.google.com/p/modwsgi/issues/detail?id=177"
                                                >weird import errors</a
                                            >. I don&#8217;t know
                                            <em>quite</em> why mod_wsgi has this
                                            particular problem (when other WSGI
                                            servers that I&#8217;ve used
                                            haven&#8217;t), but the fix
                                            isn&#8217;t that hard. So Ben
                                            <a
                                                class="reference external"

                                            and the problem went away.

                                            Personally I think this is a bug
                                            with mod_wsgi. Maybe it&#8217;s also
                                            a Python bug. But it doesn&#8217;t
                                            really matter. When a bug exists it
                                            &quot;belongs&quot; to everyone who
                                            encounters it.
                                        </p>

                                            toppcloud is not intended to be a
                                            transparent system. When it&#8217;s
                                            working correctly, you should be
                                            able to ignore most of the system
                                            and concentrate on the relatively
                                            simple abstractions given to your
                                            application. So if the configuration
                                            reveals this particular bug in
                                            Python/mod_wsgi, then the bug is
                                            essentially a toppcloud bug, and
                                            toppcloud should (and <em>can</em>)
                                            fix it.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            A more flexible system can ignore
                                            such problems as being
                                            &quot;somewhere else&quot; in the
                                            system. Or, if you don&#8217;t
                                            define these problems as someone
                                            else&#8217;s problem, then a more
                                            flexible system is essentially
                                            always broken somewhere; there is
                                            always some untested combination,
                                            some new component, or some old
                                            component that might get pushed into
                                            the mix. Fixes for one
                                            person&#8217;s problem may introduce
                                            a new problem in someone
                                            else&#8217;s stack. Some fixes
                                            aren&#8217;t even clear. toppcloud
                                            has Varnish in place, so it&#8217;s
                                            quite clear where a
                                            <a

                                            So I feel very resolved: toppcloud
                                            will hardcode everything it possibly
                                            can. Python 2.6 and only 2.6! (Until
                                            2.7, but then
                                            <strong>only 2.7</strong>!). Only
                                            Varnish/Apache/mod_wsgi. I
                                            haven&#8217;t figured out
                                            threads/processes exactly, but once
                                            I do, there will be only one way!
                                            And if I get it wrong, then everyone
                                            (<strong>everyone</strong>) will
                                            have to switch when it is corrected!
                                            Because I&#8217;d much rather have a
                                            system that is inflexible than one
                                            that doesn&#8217;t work. With a
                                            clear and solid design I think it is
                                            feasible to get this to work, and
                                            that is no small feat.

                                                for your new application. Do
                                                that like:

                                            Deployment is one of the things I
                                            like least about development, and
                                            yet without deployment the
                                            development doesn&#8217;t really
                                            matter.

                                            <em>less</em> as a result. Then I
                                            got excited about

                                            <strong>But</strong> I can&#8217;t
                                            actually <em>use</em> App Engine. I
                                            was able to come to terms with the
                                            idea of writing an application to
                                            the platform, but there are
                                            limits&#8230; and with App Engine
                                            there were simply too many limits.
                                            Geo stuff on App Engine is at best a
                                            crippled hack, I miss

                                            terribly, I never hated relational
                                            databases, and almost nothing large
                                            works without some degree of
                                            rewriting. Sometimes you can work
                                            around it, but you can never be sure
                                            you won&#8217;t hit some wall later.
                                            And frankly working around the
                                            platform is tiring and not very
                                            rewarding.

                                            So&#8230; App Engine seemed neat,
                                            but I couldn&#8217;t use it, and
                                            deployment was still a problem.

                                            What I like about App Engine: an
                                            application is just files.
                                            There&#8217;s no build process, no
                                            fancy copying of things in weird
                                            locations, nothing like that; you
                                            upload files, and uploading files
                                            <em>just works</em>. Also, you can
                                            check <em>everything</em> into
                                            version control. Not just your
                                            application code, but every library
                                            you use, the exact files that you
                                            installed. I really wanted a system
                                            like that.

                                            At the same time, I started looking
                                            into &quot;the cloud&quot;. It took
                                            me a while to get a handle on what
                                            &quot;cloud computing&quot; really
                                            means. What I learned: don&#8217;t
                                            overthink it. It&#8217;s not magic.
                                            It&#8217;s just virtual private
                                            servers that can be requisitioned
                                            automatically via an API, and are
                                            billed on a short time cycle. You
                                            can expand or change the definition
                                            a bit, but this definition is the
                                            one that matters to <em>me</em>.
                                            (I&#8217;ve also realized that I
                                            cannot get excited about complicated
                                            solutions; only once I realized how
                                            simple cloud computing is could I
                                            really get excited about the idea.)

                                            Given the modest functionality of
                                            cloud computing, why does it matter?
                                            Because with a cloud computing
                                            system you can actually
                                            <em>test</em> the full deployment
                                            stack. You can create a brand-new
                                            server, identical to all servers you
                                            will create in the future; you can
                                            set this server up; you can deploy
                                            to it. You get it wrong, you throw
                                            away that virtual server and start
                                            over from the beginning, fixing
                                            things until you get it right.
                                            Billing is important here too; with
                                            hourly billing you pay cents for
                                            these tests, and you don&#8217;t
                                            need a pool of ready servers because
                                            the cloud service basically manages
                                            that pool of ready servers for you.

                                            we each too easily find ourselves in
                                            a situation where deployments are ad
                                            hoc, server installations develop
                                            over time, and servers and
                                            applications are inconsistent in
                                            their configuration. Cloud computing
                                            makes servers disposable, which
                                            means we can treat them in
                                            consistent ways, testing our work as
                                            we go. It makes it easy to treat
                                            operations with the same discipline
                                            as software.

                                            Given the idea from App Engine, and
                                            the easy-to-use infrastructure of a
                                            cloud service, I started to script
                                            together something to manage the
                                            servers and start up applications. I
                                            didn&#8217;t know what exactly I
                                            wanted to do to start, and I&#8217;m
                                            not completely sure where I&#8217;m
                                            going with this. But on the whole
                                            this feels pretty right. So I
                                            present the provisionally-named:
                                            <a
                                                class="reference external"

                                            >
                                            (<strong>Update</strong>: this has
                                            been renamed Silver Cloud).

                                        <p>
                                            How it works: first you have a
                                            directory of files that defines your
                                            application. This probably includes
                                            a checkout of your
                                            &quot;application&quot; (let&#8217;s
                                            say in
                                            <tt class="docutils literal"
                                                ><span class="pre"
                                                    >src/mynewapp/</span
                                                ></tt
                                            >), and I find it also useful to use
                                            source control on the libraries
                                            (which are put in

                                            <em>application</em>, there is no
                                            description of the environment. You
                                            do not specify database connection
                                            details, for instance. Instead your
                                            application <em>requests</em> access
                                            to a database service. For instance,
                                            one of these services is a
                                            PostgreSQL/PostGIS database (which
                                            you get if you put

                                            like with App Engine that is merely
                                            an implementation detail. Unlike App
                                            Engine that&#8217;s an
                                            implementation detail you can
                                            actually <em>look</em> at and change
                                            (by changing toppcloud), but
                                            it&#8217;s not something you are

                                                same. It needs to be a bare
                                                server, but

                                            There&#8217;s a few other things
                                            &#8212; stuff to manage the servers
                                            and change around hostnames or the
                                            active version of applications.
                                            It&#8217;s growing to fit a variety
                                            of workflows, but I don&#8217;t
                                            think its growth is unbounded.

                                            From the outside it doen&#8217;t do
                                            a lot. From the inside it&#8217;s
                                            not actually that complicated
                                            either. I&#8217;ve included a lot of
                                            constraints in the tool but I think
                                            it offers an excellent balance. The
                                            constraints are workable for
                                            applications (insignificant for many
                                            applications), while still exposing
                                            a simple and consistent system
                                            that&#8217;s easier to reason about
                                            than a big-ball-of-server.

                                                need to request that package

                                                practice. I might have gotten
                                                the best practice wrong, but
                                                that should be resolved inside
                                                toppcloud, not inside
                                                applications. Is Varnish a
                                                terrible cache? Probably not,
                                                but if it is we should all be
                                                able to agree on that and
                                                replace it. If there are
                                                genuinely different needs then
                                                maybe additional application or
                                                deployment configuration will be
                                                called for &#8212; but we
                                                shouldn&#8217;t add
                                                configuration just because
                                                someone <em>says</em> there is a
                                                better practice (and a better
                                                practice that is not universally
                                                better); there must be
                                                justifications.

                                                By abstracting out services and
                                                persistence some additional code
                                                is required for each such
                                                service, and that code is
                                                centralized in toppcloud, but it
                                                means we can also start to add
                                                consistent tools usable across a
                                                wide set of applications and
                                                backends.

                                                moved around. I know of some
                                                particularly problematic files
                                                (e.g.,

                                                files), and toppcloud fixes
                                                these automatically. Mostly this
                                                isn&#8217;t so hard to do.

                                            Unlike generalized systems like
                                            buildout this system avoids
                                            &quot;building&quot; entirely,
                                            making deployment a simpler and
                                            lower risk action, leaning on system
                                            packages for the things they do
                                            best. Other open source tools
                                            emphasize a greater degree of
                                            flexibility than I think is
                                            necessary, allowing people to encode
                                            exploratory service integration into
                                            what <em>appears</em> to be an

                                            systems (what I&#8217;ve seen in a
                                            lot of &quot;cloud&quot; tools) this
                                            encorporates both the development
                                            environment and production
                                            environment; but unlike some
                                            developer-oriented systems this does
                                            not try to normalize
                                            everyone&#8217;s environment and

                                            appropriate. And unlike
                                            platform-neutral systems this can
                                            ensure an amount of reliability and
                                            predictability through extremely
                                            hard requirements (it is deployed on

                                            But it&#8217;s not all constraints.
                                            Toppcloud is solidly web framework

                                            code for each persistence technique,
                                            it is fairly easy to do, and there
                                            are no requirements for
                                            &quot;scalable systems&quot;; I
                                            think unscalable systems are a
                                            perfectly reasonable implementation
                                            choice for many problems. I believe
                                            a more scalable system could be
                                            built on this, but as a deployment
                                            and development option, not a
                                            starting requirement.

                                            So far I&#8217;ve done some
                                            deployments using toppcloud; not a
                                            lot, but some. And I can say that it
                                            feels really good; lots of rough
                                            edges still, but the core concept
                                            feels really right. I&#8217;ve made
                                            a lot of sideways attacks on
                                            deployment, and a few direct
                                            attacks&#8230; sometimes I write
                                            things that I think are useful, and
                                            sometimes I write things that I
                                            think are right. Toppcloud is at the
                                            moment maybe more right than useful.
                                            But I genuinely believe this is (in
                                            theory) a universally appropriate
                                            deployment tool.

                                            Now, the letdown. One thing I cannot
                                            offer you is support.
                                            <strong>THERE IS NO SUPPORT</strong
                                            >. I cannot now, and I might never
                                            really be able to support this tool.
                                            This tool is appropriate for
                                            collaborators, for people who like
                                            the idea and are ready to build on
                                            it. If it grows well I hope that it
                                            can grow a community, I hope people
                                            can support each other. I&#8217;d
                                            like to help that happen. But I
                                            can&#8217;t do that by bootstrapping
                                            it through unending support, because
                                            I&#8217;m not good at it and
                                            I&#8217;m not consistent and
                                            it&#8217;s unrealistic and
                                            unsustainable. This is not a open
                                            source dead drop. But it&#8217;s
                                            also not My Future; I&#8217;m not
                                            going to build a company around it,
                                            and I&#8217;m not going to use all
                                            my free time supporting it.
                                            It&#8217;s a tool I want to exist. I
                                            <strong>very much</strong> want it
                                            to exist. But even very much wanting
                                            something is not the same as being
                                            an undying champion, and I am not an
                                            undying champion. If you want to
                                            tell me what my process
                                            <em>should</em> be, please do!

                                            would be a natural choice, but given

                                            include a kind of reference

                                            The most prominent way this is
                                            different from the example I gave is
                                            that it doesn&#8217;t change the
                                            function signature, instead it adds
                                            an attribute
                                            <tt class="docutils literal"

                                            with the function. My goal with this
                                            is that the decorator isn&#8217;t
                                            intrusive. Here&#8217;s the case

                                            This still works, because the

                                            <em>any</em> WSGI application, not
                                            just a WebOb Response object. But
                                            that&#8217;s not helpful, because I
                                            need errors&#8230;

                                            method that passes in errors. But I

                                            decorator, instead I have to
                                            refactor the code to have a third
                                            method that both

                                            use. Of course, there&#8217;s more
                                            than one way to address this issue,
                                            but this is the technique I like.

                                            The one other notable feature is
                                            that you can also make middleware:

                                            One of the constant annoyances to me
                                            in web applications is the
                                            self-proclaimed need for those
                                            applications to know about
                                            everything and do everything, and
                                            only spotty ad hoc techniques for
                                            including things from other
                                            applications.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            An example might be blog navigation
                                            or search, where you can only
                                            include data from the application
                                            itself. Or &quot;Recent Posts&quot;
                                            which can only show locally-produce
                                            posts. What if I post something
                                            elsewhere? I have to create some
                                            shoddy placeholder post to refer to
                                            it. Bah! Underlying this the data is
                                            usually structured in a specific
                                            way, with the HTML being a sort of
                                            artifact of the database, the markup
                                            transient and a slave to the
                                            database&#8217;s structure.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            An example of this might be a recent
                                            post listing like:
                                        </p>

                                            There&#8217;s clearly no room for
                                            exceptions in this code. I am thus
                                            proposing that any system like this
                                            should have the notion of a
                                            &quot;link&quot; as a first-class
                                            object. The code should look like
                                            this:

                                            here). By allowing arbitrary HTML in
                                            certain places you make it possible
                                            for people to extend the site in
                                            little ways &#8212; possibly adding
                                            markup to a title, or allowing an
                                            item in the list that actually
                                            contains two URLs (e.g.,
                                            <tt class="docutils literal"
                                                ><span class="pre">&lt;a</span>
                                                <span class="pre"
                                                    >href=&quot;url1&quot;&gt;Some</span

                                                <span class="pre"

                                                    >href=&quot;url2&quot;&gt;via&lt;/a&gt;)</span
                                                ></tt

                                            In the context of Python I recommend
                                            making these into methods, not
                                            properties, because it allows you to
                                            later add keyword arguments to
                                            specialize the markup (like
                                            <tt class="docutils literal"
                                                ><span class="pre"
                                                    >post.link(abbreviated=True)</span
                                                ></tt
                                            >).
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            One negative aspect of this is that
                                            you cannot affect all the markup
                                            through the template alone, you may
                                            have to go into the Python code to
                                            change things. Anyone have ideas for
                                            handling this problem?

                                                versions will also work
                                                together, but they won&#8217;t
                                                necessarily work together with

                                                framework. And breakage can also
                                                occur regardless of a buildbot.

                                                have been noted, there&#8217;s
                                                going to be lots of unknown

                                                When starting development with a
                                                framework, the developer would
                                                like to start with some
                                                known-good set, which is a set
                                                that can be developed by the
                                                framework developers, or
                                                potentially by any person. For
                                                instance, if you extend a public
                                                framework with an internal
                                                framework (or even a public
                                                sub-framework like

                                                be developed by a different set
                                                of people.

                                                the developer will add on other
                                                libraries, or use some of their
                                                own libraries. Development will
                                                probably occur at the trunk/tip
                                                of several libraries as they are
                                                developed together.

                                                A developer might upgrade the
                                                entire framework, or just
                                                upgrade one piece (for instance,
                                                to get a bug fix they are
                                                interested in, or follow a

                                                At the time of deployment the
                                                developer wants to make sure all

                                                At any time, another developer
                                                may want to clone the same set
                                                of libraries.

                                                developer may want to upgrade a
                                                single component, if only to
                                                test that an upgrade works, or
                                                if it resolves a bug. They may
                                                test out combinations only to
                                                throw them away, and they
                                                don&#8217;t want to bump
                                                versions of libraries in order
                                                to deploy new combinations.

                                            packages. Or they can provide a
                                            starting point for an active line of
                                            development. Or they can provide a
                                            historical record of how something
                                            was put together.

                                            version, or you might have installed

                                            have used the last release. So you
                                            go and adjust some things.

                                            Martijn also asks: how do you have
                                            framework developers maintain one
                                            file, and then also have developers
                                            maintain their own lists for their
                                            projects?
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            You could start with a file like
                                            this for the framework itself.
                                            Pylons for instance could ship with
                                            something like this. To install
                                            Pylons you could then do:

                                            That is, requirements files can
                                            refer to each other. So if you want
                                            to maintain your own requirements
                                            file alongside the development of an
                                            upstream requirements file, you
                                            could do that.

                                            I thought at least I should correct

                                                (description, version, etc), and

                                                that extra data. Fixing this
                                                problem in Distutils is an
                                                important aspect of Setuptools,
                                                and part of what Distutils

                                                is not the same as a
                                                distribution, though usually a
                                                distribution will have the same
                                                name as a package. In my own
                                                libraries I try to name the
                                                distribution with mixed case
                                                (like Paste) and the package
                                                with lower case (like paste).
                                                Keeping the terminology straight
                                                here is <em>very</em> difficult;
                                                and usually it doesn&#8217;t
                                                matter, but sometimes it does.

                                                This is an alternative to
                                                easy_install. It works
                                                <em>somewhat</em> differently
                                                than easy_install, but not much.
                                                Mostly it is
                                                <em>better</em> than
                                                easy_install, in that it has
                                                some extra features and is
                                                easier to use. Unlike
                                                easy_install, it downloads all
                                                distributions up-front, and
                                                generates the metadata to read
                                                distribution and version
                                                requirements. It uses Setuptools
                                                to generate this metadata from a
                                                setup.py file, and uses
                                                pkg_resources to parse this
                                                metadata. It then installs
                                                packages

                                                I&#8217;ve heard the many
                                                complaints about easy_install
                                                (and I&#8217;ve had many
                                                myself), but ultimately I think
                                                pip does well by just fixing a
                                                few small issues. Pip is
                                                <em>not</em> a repudiation of
                                                Setuptools or the basic
                                                mechanisms that easy_install
                                                uses.

                                                This is a defunct package that
                                                had some of the features of pip
                                                (particularly requirement files)
                                                but used easy_install for
                                                installation. Don&#8217;t bother
                                                with this, it was just a bridge
                                                to get to pip.

                                                sometime. Using virtualenv you
                                                don&#8217;t have to worry about
                                                different library versions,
                                                because for any one environment
                                                you will probably only need one
                                                version of a library. On any one
                                                <em>machine</em> you probably
                                                need different versions, which
                                                is why installing packages
                                                system-wide is problematic for
                                                most libraries. (I&#8217;ve been

                                                think using system packaging for
                                                libraries is counter-productive,
                                                but that&#8217;ll wait for
                                                another time.)

                                            Setuptools.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            First, zip files. Setuptools prefers
                                            zip files, for reasons that
                                            won&#8217;t mean much to you, and
                                            maybe are more historical than
                                            anything. When a distribution
                                            doesn&#8217;t indicate if it is
                                            zip-safe, Setuptools looks at the
                                            code and sees if it uses
                                            <tt class="docutils literal"
                                                ><span class="pre"
                                                    >__file__</span
                                                ></tt
                                            >, an if not it presumes that the
                                            code is probably zip-safe. The
                                            specific problem James cites is what
                                            appears to be a bug in Django, that
                                            Django looks for code and
                                            can&#8217;t traverse into zip files
                                            in the same way that Python itself
                                            can. Setuptools didn&#8217;t itself
                                            add anything to Python to make it
                                            import zip files, that functionality
                                            was added to Python some time
                                            before. The zipped eggs that
                                            Setuptools installs are using
                                            existing (standard!) Python
                                            functionality.

                                            That said, I don&#8217;t think
                                            zipping libraries up is all that
                                            useful, and while it
                                            <em>should</em> work, it
                                            doesn&#8217;t always, and it makes
                                            code harder to inspect and
                                            understand. So since it&#8217;s not
                                            that useful, I&#8217;ve disabled it
                                            when pip installs packages. I also
                                            have had it disabled on my own
                                            system for years now, by creating a
                                            <tt class="docutils literal"
                                                ><span class="pre"
                                                    >distutils.cfg</span
                                                ></tt
                                            >
                                            file with
                                            <tt class="docutils literal"
                                                ><span class="pre"
                                                    >[easy_install]</span

                                                <span class="pre">=</span>
                                                <span class="pre"

                                            in it. Sadly App Engine is forcing
                                            me to use zip files again, because
                                            of its absurdly small file
                                            limits&#8230; but that&#8217;s a
                                            different topic. (There is an
                                            experimental
                                            <tt class="docutils literal"

                                            <tt class="docutils literal"

                                            and Setuptools. Indeed it is easy to
                                            get things messed up, and it is easy
                                            to piss people off by
                                            overspecifying, and sometimes things
                                            can get in a weird state for no good
                                            reason (often because of
                                            easy_install&#8217;s rather naive
                                            leap-before-you-look installation
                                            order). Pip fixes that last point,
                                            but it also tries to suggest more
                                            constructive and less painful ways
                                            to manage other pieces.

                                            contain two things:
                                            <strong>1</strong>: all the
                                            libraries used by the distribution
                                            (without which there&#8217;s no way
                                            it&#8217;ll work) and
                                            <strong>2</strong>: exclusions of
                                            the versions of those libraries that
                                            are
                                            <strong>known not to work</strong>.
                                            setup.py requirements should not be
                                            viewed as an assertion that by
                                            satisfying those requirements
                                            everything <em>will</em> work, just
                                            that it <em>might</em> work. Only
                                            the end developer, testing the
                                            system together, can figure out if
                                            it really works. Then pip gives you
                                            a way to record that working set
                                            (using

                                            conflicts between Setuptools and
                                            package maintainers. This is kind of
                                            a proxy war between developers and
                                            sysadmins, who have very different
                                            motivations. It deserves a post of
                                            its own, but the conflicts are about
                                            more than just how Setuptools is
                                            implemented.

                                            I&#8217;d love if there was a

                                            installation and management tool
                                            that really worked. Linux system
                                            package managers are absolutely not
                                            that tool; frankly it is absurd to
                                            even consider them as an
                                            alternative. So for now we do our
                                            best in our respective language
                                            communities. If we&#8217;re going to
                                            move forward, we&#8217;ll have to
                                            acknowledge what&#8217;s come
                                            before, and the reasoning for it.

                                            When people think about web scraping
                                            in Python, they usually think
                                            <a
                                                class="reference external"
                                                href="http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/"
                                                >BeautifulSoup</a
                                            >. That&#8217;s okay, but I would
                                            encourage you to also consider
                                            <a
                                                class="reference external"
                                                href="http://codespeak.net/lxml/"
                                                >lxml</a
                                            >.
                                        </p>

                                            First, people think BeautifulSoup is
                                            better at parsing broken HTML.
                                            <strong
                                                >This is not correct.</strong
                                            >
                                            lxml parses broken HTML quite
                                            nicely. I haven&#8217;t done any
                                            thorough testing, but at least
                                            <a
                                                class="reference external"
                                                href="http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/documentation.html#Parsing%20HTML"
                                                >the BeautifulSoup broken HTML
                                                example</a
                                            >
                                            is parsed better by lxml (which
                                            knows that
                                            <tt class="docutils literal"
                                                ><span class="pre"

                                                ></tt
                                            >
                                            elements should go inside
                                            <tt class="docutils literal"
                                                ><span class="pre"
                                                    >&lt;table&gt;</span
                                                ></tt
                                            >
                                            elements).
                                        </p>

                                            Second, people feel lxml is harder
                                            to install. This is correct.
                                            <strong>BUT</strong>, lxml 2.2alpha1
                                            includes an option to compile static
                                            versions of the underlying C
                                            libraries, which should improve the
                                            installation experience, especially
                                            on Macs. To install this new way,
                                            try:
                                        </p>

                                            One you have lxml installed, you
                                            have a great parser (which happens
                                            to be

                                            and that is
                                            <strong>not a tradeoff</strong>).
                                            You get a fairly familiar API based
                                            on
                                            <a

                                            feeling at first, offers a compact
                                            and canonical representation of a
                                            document tree, compared to more
                                            traditional representations. But
                                            there&#8217;s more&#8230;

                                            screen scraping is that you get CSS
                                            selectors. You can use XPath as
                                            well, but usually that&#8217;s more

                                            lxml generally knows more about HTML
                                            than BeautifulSoup. Also I think it
                                            does well with the small details;
                                            for instance, the lxml example will
                                            match elements in
                                            <tt class="docutils literal"

                                            sites use minimal forms, but
                                            searching for &quot;registration

                                            Now we have a form object.
                                            There&#8217;s two ways to get to the
                                            fields:
                                            <tt class="docutils literal"
                                                ><span class="pre"
                                                    >form.inputs</span
                                                ></tt
                                            >, which gives us a dictionary of
                                            all the actual
                                            <tt class="docutils literal"
                                                ><span class="pre"
                                                    >&lt;input&gt;</span
                                                ></tt
                                            >
                                            elements (and textarea and select).
                                            There&#8217;s also
                                            <tt class="docutils literal"
                                                ><span class="pre"
                                                    >form.fields</span
                                                ></tt
                                            >, which is a dictionary-like
                                            object. The dictionary-like object
                                            is convenient, for instance:
                                        </p>
                                        <div
                                            class="dean_ch"
                                            style="white-space: wrap"
                                        >
                                            <br />
                                            &gt;&gt;&gt; form.<span class="me1"
                                                >fields</span

                                            ><span class="br0">&#93;</span> =
                                            <span class="st0"
                                                >'me&amp;#64;example.com'</span

                                        </div>
                                        <p>
                                            This actually updates the input
                                            element itself:
                                        </p>
                                        <div

                                            I think it&#8217;s actually a nicer
                                            API than
                                            <a
                                                class="reference external"
                                                href="http://formencode.org/htmlfill.html"
                                                >htmlfill</a
                                            >
                                            and can serve the same purpose on
                                            the server side.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            But then you can also use the same
                                            interface for scraping, by filling
                                            fields and getting the submission.
                                            That looks like:
                                        </p>
                                        <div
