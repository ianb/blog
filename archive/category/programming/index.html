                                            all wrong! Doctest.js is the best!

                                            One issue in particular is that
                                            people (especially people in my
                                            Python-biased circles) are perhaps
                                            thrown off by Python&#8217;s
                                            doctest. I think Python&#8217;s
                                            doctest is pretty nice, I enjoy
                                            testing with it, but there&#8217;s
                                            no question that it has a lot of
                                            problems. I&#8217;ve even thought
                                            about trying to fix doctest, and
                                            even made a repository, but I only
                                            really got as far as
                                            <a

                                            never actually <em>made</em> those
                                            fixes. Doctest has, in its life,
                                            only really had a single period of
                                            improvement (in the time leading to
                                            Python 2.4). That&#8217;s not a
                                            recipe for success.

                                            Of course doctest.js takes
                                            inspiration from Python&#8217;s
                                            doctest, but I wrote it as a real
                                            test environment, not for a minimal
                                            use case. In the process I fixed a
                                            bunch of issues with doctest, and in
                                            places Javascript has also provided
                                            helpful usability.

                                                The print order of a dictionary
                                                is arbitrary, based on a hash
                                                algorithm that can change, or
                                                mix things up as items are added
                                                or removed. And to make it
                                                worse, the output
                                                <em>usually</em> stable, such
                                                that you can write tests that
                                                unexpectibly fragile. But
                                                there&#8217;s no reason why

                                                make output predictable. One
                                                reason this is fairly easy is
                                                that there&#8217;s nothing like
                                                <tt class="docutils literal"
                                                    ><span class="pre"
                                                        >repr()</span
                                                    ></tt
                                                >
                                                in Javascript, so doctest.js has
                                                its own implementation.
                                                It&#8217;s like I started with
                                                pprint and no other notion
                                                existed.
                                            </p>
                                        </div>
                                        <div class="section" id="good-matching">
                                            <h2>Good matching</h2>
                                            <p>
                                                In addition to unpredictable
                                                output, there&#8217;s also just
                                                hard-to-match output. Output
                                                might contain blank lines, for
                                                instance, and Python&#8217;s
                                                doctest requires a very ugly
                                                <tt class="docutils literal"
                                                    ><span class="pre"
                                                        >&lt;BLANKLINE&gt;</span
                                                    ></tt
                                                >
                                                token to handle that. Whitespace
                                                might not be normalized. Maybe
                                                there&#8217;s boring output.
                                                Maybe there&#8217;s just a
                                                volatile item like a timestamp.
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                                Doctest.js includes, by default,
                                                ellipsis:
                                                <tt class="docutils literal"
                                                    ><span class="pre"
                                                        >...</span

                                                >
                                                matches any length of text. But
                                                it also includes another
                                                wildcard,
                                                <tt class="docutils literal"
                                                    ><span class="pre"
                                                        >?</span
                                                    ></tt
                                                >, which matches just one number
                                                or word. This avoids cases when
                                                the use of
                                                <tt class="docutils literal"
                                                    ><span class="pre"
                                                        >...</span

                                                swallows up too much when you
                                                just wanted to get a single
                                                word.
                                            </p>

                                                Also doctest.js doesn&#8217;t
                                                use
                                                <tt class="docutils literal"

                                                meaning you can&#8217;t just
                                                ignore output, like:

                                                I&#8217;m actually pretty okay
                                                with Python doctest&#8217;s
                                                notion that you just run all the
                                                tests, even when one fails.
                                                Getting too many failures is a
                                                bit of a nuisance, but
                                                it&#8217;s not
                                                <em>that bad</em>. But
                                                there&#8217;s no way to just
                                                give up, and there needs to be.
                                                If you are relying on something
                                                to be importable, or some
                                                service to be available,
                                                there&#8217;s no point in going
                                                on with the tests.

                                                Doctest.js also forces the
                                                developer to print everything
                                                they care about. For better or
                                                worse Javascript has many more
                                                expressions than Python
                                                (including assignments), so
                                                looking at the result of an
                                                expression isn&#8217;t a good
                                                clue for whether you
                                                <em>care</em> about the result
                                                of an expression. I&#8217;m not
                                                sure this is <em>better</em>,
                                                but it&#8217;s part of the
                                                difference.

                                                the example you are in (an

                                                Not a problem for doctest.js in
                                                particular, but a problem for
                                                any Javascript test framework.
                                                You want to test return values,
                                                but lots of functions
                                                don&#8217;t &quot;return&quot;,
                                                instead they call some callback
                                                or create some kind of promise
                                                object, and you have to test for
                                                side effects.

                                                context of Javascript doctest.js
                                                has something really useful and
                                                unique. If callback-driven async
                                                code had ever been very popular
                                                in Python then this sort of
                                                feature would be nice there too.

                                                A lot of where doctest.js is
                                                much better than Python&#8217;s
                                                doctest is simply that it has a
                                                much more powerful environment
                                                for displaying results. It can
                                                highlight failed or passing
                                                tests. When there&#8217;s a
                                                wildcard in expected output, it
                                                can show the actual output
                                                without adding any particular
                                                extra distraction. It can group
                                                console messages with the tests
                                                they go with. It can show
                                                <em>both</em> a simple failure
                                                message, and a detailed
                                                line-by-line comparison. All
                                                these details make it easy to
                                                identify what went wrong and fix
                                                it. The browser gives a rich and
                                                navigable interface.

                                                Node.js (right now it works, but
                                                is not appealing), but I just
                                                can&#8217;t bring myself to give
                                                up the browser. I have to figure
                                                out a good hybrid.

                                                these problems: no one cares
                                                about it, no one feels
                                                responsible for it, and no one
                                                feels empowered to make
                                                improvements to it. And to make

                                                because I love it. I wish it was
                                                better, and I made doctest.js in
                                                a way I wish Python&#8217;s

                                            And then maybe I&#8217;d actually
                                            like to keep my config out of my
                                            source control, or have a build
                                            process that I run locally, or any
                                            number of things. I&#8217;d like to
                                            be able to test deployment, but
                                            every deployment is a commit, and I
                                            like to commit <em>tested</em> work.
                                            I think I could use
                                            <tt class="docutils literal"
                                                ><span class="pre">git</span>
                                                <span class="pre"
                                                    >rebase</span

                                            but I lack the discipline to undo my
                                            work so I can do it correctly. This
                                            is why I don&#8217;t do continuous
                                            commits.

                                            There&#8217;s a whole different
                                            level of weirdness when you use
                                            <a
                                                class="reference external"

                                            as you aren&#8217;t pushing to a
                                            deployment-specific remote, you are
                                            pushing to a deployment-specific
                                            branch.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            So I&#8217;ve generally thought: git
                                            deployment is wrong.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            Then I was talking to some other
                                            people at Mozilla and they mentioned
                                            that ops was using git for simply
                                            moving files around even though the
                                            stuff they were deploying was itself
                                            in Mercurial. They had a particular
                                            site with a very large number of
                                            files, and it was faster to use git
                                            than rsync (git has more metadata
                                            than rsync; rsync has to look at
                                            <em>everything</em> everytime you
                                            sync). And that all seemed very
                                            reasonable; git is a fine way to
                                            sync things.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            But I kind of forgot about it all,
                                            and just swore to myself as I did
                                            too many trivial commits and wrote
                                            too many meaningless commit
                                            messages.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            Still&#8230; it isn&#8217;t so hard
                                            to separate these concerns, is it?
                                            So I wrote up a
                                            <a

                                            to your deployment remote. You can
                                            send modified and untracked files,
                                            and you can run a build script
                                            before committing and push the
                                            <em>result</em> of the build script,
                                            all without sullying your
                                            &quot;real&quot; source control. And
                                            you happen to have a nice history of
                                            deployments, which is also nice.

                                            I&#8217;ve only used this a little
                                            bit, but I&#8217;ve enjoyed when I
                                            have used it, and it makes me feel
                                            much better/clearer about my actual
                                            commits. It&#8217;s really short
                                            right now, and probably gets some
                                            things entirely wrong (e.g., moving
                                            over untracked files). But it works
                                            well enough to be improved
                                            (<em>winkwinknudgenudge</em>).

                                            I think the most interesting work in
                                            programming languages right now is
                                            about the <em>runtime</em>, not
                                            syntax or even the languages
                                            themselves. Which places PyPy in an
                                            interesting position, as they have
                                            put a great deal of effort into
                                            abstracting out the concept of
                                            runtime from the language they are
                                            implementing (Python).
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            There are of course other runtime
                                            environments available to Python.
                                            The main environment has and
                                            continues to be CPython &#8212; the
                                            runtime developed in parallel with
                                            the language, and with continuous
                                            incremental feedback and improvement
                                            by the Python developer community.
                                            It is the runtime that informs and
                                            is informed by the language.
                                            It&#8217;s also the runtime that is
                                            most easy-going about integrating
                                            with C libraries, and by extension
                                            it is part of the vague but
                                            important runtime environment of
                                            &quot;Unix&quot;. There&#8217;s also
                                            Jython and IronPython. I frankly
                                            find these completely uninteresting.
                                            They are runtimes controlled by
                                            companies, not communities, and the
                                            Python implementations are neither
                                            natural parts of their runtime
                                            environments, nor do the runtimes
                                            include many concessions to make
                                            themselves natural for Python.

                                            PyPy is somewhere different. It
                                            still has a tremendous challenge
                                            because Python was not developed
                                            <em>for</em> PyPy. Even small
                                            changes to the language seem
                                            impossible &#8212; something as
                                            seemingly innocuous as making
                                            builtins static seems to be stuck in
                                            a conservative reluctance to change.
                                            But unlike Jython and IronPython
                                            they aren&#8217;t stuck between a
                                            rock and a hard place; they just
                                            have to deal with the rock, not the
                                            hard place.
                                        </p>

                                            So here is my unsolicited advice on
                                            what PyPy-the-runtime should
                                            consider. Simple improvements to
                                            performance and the runtime are
                                            fine, but being incrementally better
                                            than CPython only goes so far, and I
                                            personally doubt it will ever make a
                                            big impact on Python that way.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            PyPy should push hard on
                                            <em>concurrency</em> and
                                            <em>reliability</em>. If it is
                                            <em>fast enough</em> then
                                            that&#8217;s fine; that&#8217;s done
                                            as far as I&#8217;m concerned. I say
                                            this because I&#8217;m a web
                                            programmer, and speed is
                                            uninteresting to me. Certainly
                                            opinions will differ. But to me
                                            speed (as it&#8217;s normally
                                            defined) is really
                                            <em>really</em> uninteresting. When
                                            or if I care about speed I&#8217;m
                                            probably more drawn to Cython. I
                                            <em>do</em> care about latency,
                                            memory efficiency,
                                            scalability/concurrency, resource
                                            efficiency, and most of all
                                            <em>worst cases</em>. I don&#8217;t
                                            think a JIT addresses any of these
                                            (and can even make things worse). I
                                            don&#8217;t know of benchmarks that
                                            measure these parameters either.

                                            I want a runtime with new and novel
                                            features; something that isn&#8217;t
                                            just incrementally better than
                                            CPython. This itself might seem
                                            controversial, as the only point to
                                            such novel features would be for
                                            people to implement at least some
                                            code intended for
                                            <em>only</em> PyPy. But if the
                                            features are good enough then
                                            I&#8217;m okay with this &#8212; and
                                            if I&#8217;m not drawn to write
                                            something that will only work on
                                            PyPy, I probably won&#8217;t be
                                            drawn to use PyPy <em>at all</em>;
                                            natural conservatism and inertia
                                            will keep me (and most people) on
                                            CPython indefinitely.

                                                it&#8217;s just not the same.
                                                Which is not entirely a
                                                criticism &#8212; it shows that

                                                then you can efficiently share

                                                without the overhead of copying

                                                to support this new model, than
                                                to abandon what could be
                                                PyPy&#8217;s best feature to

                                                extension ecosystem. Being a web
                                                programmer I honestly
                                                don&#8217;t need many C modules,
                                                so maybe I&#8217;m biased. But
                                                if the rest of the system is
                                                good enough then the C
                                                extensions will come.

                                                Make sure resource sharing that
                                                happens outside of the Python

                                                libraries are often going to be
                                                unfriendly towards
                                                microprocesses; make sure what
                                                <em>is</em> exposed to the

                                                That might even mean a dangerous
                                                process mode that can handle
                                                ctypes and FFI and where you
                                                carefully write Python code that
                                                has extra powers, so long as
                                                there&#8217;s a strong wall
                                                between that code and
                                                &quot;general&quot; code that
                                                makes use of those services.

                                                worth leaning on. I also have

                                                could be a good way to do FFI in
                                                a safe manner, as Cython already
                                                supports multiple targets
                                                (Python 2 and 3) from the same
                                                codebase. Could PyPy be another
                                                target?

                                            for web development. Python could be
                                            as reliable as, oh&#8230;

                                            Erlang! Maybe we could get the
                                            benefits of async without the pain
                                            of callbacks or Deferreds. And these
                                            are features people would
                                            <em>use</em>. Right now I&#8217;m
                                            perceiving a problem where
                                            there&#8217;s lots of people
                                            standing on the sidelines cheering
                                            you on but not actually
                                            <em>using</em> PyPy.

                                            So: I wouldn&#8217;t tell anyone
                                            what to do, and if someone tries
                                            this out I&#8217;ll probably only be
                                            on the sidelines cheering you
                                            on&#8230; but I really think this

                                            At PyCon there was an open space
                                            about deployment, and the idea of
                                            drop-in applications
                                            (Java-WAR-style).
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            I generally get pessimistic about
                                            80% solutions, and dropping in a WAR
                                            file feels like an 80% solution to
                                            me. I&#8217;ve used the
                                            Hudson/Jenkins installer (which I
                                            think is <em>specifically</em> a
                                            project that got WARs on
                                            people&#8217;s minds), and in a lot
                                            of ways that installer is nice, but
                                            it&#8217;s also kind of wonky, it
                                            makes configuration unclear,
                                            it&#8217;s not always clear when it
                                            installs or configures itself
                                            through the web, and when you have
                                            to do this at the system level, nor
                                            is it clear where it puts files and
                                            data, etc. So a great initial
                                            experience doesn&#8217;t feel like a
                                            great ongoing experience to me
                                            &#8212; and
                                            <em
                                                >it doesn&#8217;t have to be
                                                that way</em
                                            >. If those were
                                            <em>necessary</em> compromises,
                                            sure, but they aren&#8217;t. And
                                            because we
                                            <em>don&#8217;t have</em> WAR files,
                                            if we&#8217;re proposing to make
                                            something new, then we have every
                                            opportunity to make things better.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            So the question then is what
                                            we&#8217;re trying to make. To me:
                                            we want applications that are easy
                                            to install, that are
                                            self-describing, self-configuring
                                            (or at least guide you through
                                            configuration), reliable with
                                            respect to their environment (not
                                            dependent on system tweaking),
                                            upgradable, and respectful of
                                            persistence (the data that outlives
                                            the application install). A lot of
                                            this can be done by the
                                            &quot;container&quot; (to use Java
                                            parlance; or
                                            &quot;environment&quot;) &#8212; if
                                            you just have the app packaged in a
                                            nice way, the container (server
                                            environment, hosting service, etc)
                                            can handle all the system-specific
                                            things to make the application
                                            actually work.

                                            project, which defines something
                                            very much like this. Silver Lining
                                            isn&#8217;t <em>just</em> an
                                            application format, and things
                                            aren&#8217;t fully extracted along
                                            these lines, but it&#8217;s pretty
                                            close and it addresses a lot of
                                            important issues in the lifecycle of
                                            an application. To be clear: Silver
                                            Lining is an application packaging
                                            format, a server configuration
                                            library, a cloud server management
                                            tool, a persistence management tool,
                                            and a tool to manage the application
                                            with respect to all these services
                                            over time. It is a bunch of things,
                                            maybe too many things, so it is not
                                            unreasonable to pick out a smaller
                                            subset to focus on. Maybe an easy
                                            place to start (and good for Silver
                                            Lining itself) would be to separate
                                            at least the application format (and
                                            tools to manage applications in that
                                            state, e.g., installing new
                                            libraries) from the tools that make
                                            use of such applications (deploy,
                                            etc).

                                            Some opinions I have on this format,
                                            exemplified in Silver Lining:

                                                single file, unlike WARs.
                                                Uploading zip files is not a
                                                great API. Geez. I know
                                                there&#8217;s this desire to
                                                &quot;just drop in a file&quot;;
                                                but there&#8217;s no getting
                                                around the fact that
                                                &quot;dropping a file&quot;
                                                becomes a

                                                But of course there isn&#8217;t
                                                really any deployment protocol
                                                inferred by a format anyway, so
                                                maybe I&#8217;m getting ahead of
                                                myself ;) I&#8217;m saying a
                                                tool that deploys should take as
                                                an argument a directory, not a
                                                single file. (If the tool then
                                                zips it up and uploads it,
                                                fine!)
                                            </li>
                                            <li>
                                                Configuration &quot;comes from
                                                the outside&quot;. That is, an
                                                application requests services,
                                                and the <em>container</em> tells
                                                the application where those
                                                services are. For Silver Lining
                                                I&#8217;ve used environmental
                                                variables. I think this one
                                                point is really important
                                                &#8212; the container
                                                <em>tells</em> the application.
                                                As a counter-example, an
                                                application that comes with a
                                                Puppet deployment recipe is
                                                essentially <em>telling</em> the
                                                server how to arrange itself to
                                                suit the application. This will
                                                never be reliable or simple!
                                            </li>
                                            <li>
                                                The application indicates what
                                                &quot;services&quot; it wants;
                                                for instance, it may want to
                                                have access to a MySQL database.
                                                The container then provides this
                                                to the application. In practice
                                                this means installing the actual
                                                packages, but also creating a
                                                database and setting up
                                                permissions appropriately. The
                                                alternative is never having
                                                <em>any</em> dependencies,
                                                meaning you have to use SQLite
                                                databases or ad hoc structures,
                                                etc. But in fact installing
                                                databases really isn&#8217;t
                                                that hard these days.

                                                use a service of some kind. If
                                                you want to be able to write to
                                                files, you need to use a file
                                                service. This means the
                                                container is fully aware of
                                                everything the application is
                                                leaving behind. All the various
                                                paths an application should use
                                                are given in different

                                                libraries. That means the

                                                libraries it requires. Nothing

                                                would have to be abstracted
                                                some.

                                                It&#8217;s lame to try to test

                                                the frequent alternative. Also,
                                                it gives the application the
                                                chance to signal that the
                                                installation failed.

                                                sense of configuration. You
                                                don&#8217;t have to use this if
                                                you make your app

                                                configuration would be helpful.

                                                practice would be part of how
                                                the application is written. For
                                                instance, I make sure each app
                                                has its own temporary directory,
                                                and that it is cleared on
                                                update. If you keep session
                                                files in that location, and you
                                                expect the environment to clean
                                                up old sessions &#8212; well,
                                                either all environments should

                                                simply define one process model

                                                &#8212; most notably, multiple
                                                processes have a significant

                                                threads. An application should
                                                at least be able to indicate
                                                what process models it accepts
                                                and prefers.

                                                as well. Maybe there should be
                                                conventions for both.

                                                Cron jobs are important. Though
                                                maybe they could just be yet
                                                another kind of service? Many
                                                extra features could be new
                                                services.

                                                Logging is also important;
                                                Silver Lining attempts to handle
                                                that somewhat, but it could be
                                                specified much better.

                                                Silver Lining also supports PHP,
                                                which seemed to cause a bit of
                                                stress. But just ignore that.
                                                It&#8217;s really easy to
                                                ignore.

                                            (together with a bunch of Silver

                                            admittedly some other stuff that is
                                            only really specified in code; but
                                            in Silver Lining&#8217;s defense,
                                            specified in code is better than
                                            unspecified ;) App Engine provides
                                            another example of an application
                                            format, and would be worth using as
                                            a point of discussion or contrast (I
                                            did that myself when writing Silver
                                            Lining).

                                            Discussing WSGI stuff with Ben
                                            Bangert at PyCon he noted that he
                                            didn&#8217;t really feel like the
                                            WSGI pieces needed that much more
                                            work, or at least that&#8217;s not
                                            where the interesting work was
                                            &#8212; the interesting work is in
                                            the tooling. An application format
                                            could provide a great basis for
                                            building this tooling. And I
                                            honestly think that the tooling has
                                            been held back more by divergent
                                            patterns of development than by the
                                            difficulty of writing the tools
                                            themselves; and a good, general
                                            application format could fix that.

                                            It&#8217;s fun to use something new,
                                            and it&#8217;s relatively
                                            straight-forward to get started so
                                            it&#8217;s an
                                            <em>emotionally satisfying</em>
                                            experience.

                                            There are several reasons you might
                                            want to use Node.js, and I&#8217;ll
                                            ignore many of them, but I want to
                                            talk about one in particular:

                                                It&#8217;s not easy to have
                                                expertise at multiple languages.
                                                But it&#8217;s not
                                                <em>that hard</em>. It&#8217;s
                                                considerably harder to have
                                                expertise at
                                                <em>multiple platforms</em>.
                                                Node.js gives you one language
                                                across client and server, but
                                                <em>not</em> one platform.
                                                Node.js programming
                                                doesn&#8217;t <em>feel</em> like
                                                the browser environment. They do
                                                adopt many conventions when
                                                it&#8217;s reasonable, but even
                                                then it&#8217;s not always the
                                                case &#8212; in particular
                                                because many browser APIs are
                                                the awkward product of C++
                                                programmers exposing things to
                                                Javascript, and you don&#8217;t
                                                want to reproduce those same
                                                APIs if you don&#8217;t have to
                                                (and Node.js doesn&#8217;t have
                                                to!) &#8212; an example is the
                                                event pattern in Node, which is
                                                similar to a browser but less
                                                obtuse.

                                                First: the same set of libraries
                                                is probably not applicable. If
                                                you can do it on the client then
                                                you probably don&#8217;t
                                                <em>have</em> to do it on the
                                                server, and vice versa.

                                                But sometimes the same libraries
                                                are useful. Can you really share
                                                them? Browser libraries are
                                                often hard to use elsewhere
                                                because they rely on browser
                                                APIs. These APIs are frequently

                                                the browser. And then of course
                                                all the system calls,
                                                <em>none</em> of which you can
                                                use in the browser.

                                                surmountable challenges, through
                                                modularity, mocking,
                                                abstractions, and so on&#8230;
                                                but ultimately I think the
                                                motivation is lacking: the
                                                domain of changing a
                                                live-rendered DOM isn&#8217;t
                                                the same as producing bytes to
                                                put onto a socket.

                                                <em>useful</em>. The client and
                                                the server are different places,
                                                with different expectations. Any
                                                vagueness about that boundary is
                                                <em>wrong</em>.

                                                It&#8217;s wrong from a security
                                                perspective, as the security
                                                assumptions are nearly opposite
                                                on the two platforms. The client
                                                trusts itself, and the server
                                                trusts itself, and both should
                                                hold the other in suspicion
                                                (though the client can be more
                                                trusting because the
                                                <em>browser</em> doesn&#8217;t
                                                trust the client code).
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                                But it&#8217;s also the wrong
                                                way to treat HTTP. HTTP is
                                                pretty simple until you try to
                                                make it simpler. Efforts to make
                                                it simpler mostly make it more
                                                complicated. HTTP lets you send
                                                serialized data back and forth
                                                to a server, with a bunch of
                                                metadata and other do-dads. And
                                                that&#8217;s all neat, but you
                                                should always be thinking about
                                                <em>sending</em> information.
                                                And never
                                                <em>sharing</em> information.
                                                It&#8217;s not a fluid boundary,
                                                and code that touches HTTP needs
                                                to be explicit about it and not
                                                pretend it is equivalent to any
                                                other non-network operation.

                                                Certainly you don&#8217;t
                                                <em>need</em> two implementation
                                                languages to keep your mind
                                                clear. But it doesn&#8217;t
                                                hurt.

                                                and server using the same code.
                                                And of course, what web
                                                developer hasn&#8217;t been a

                                                with a form, and helping the

                                                in that case, you can simply

                                                Javascript is becoming
                                                increasingly less relevant, and
                                                if we aren&#8217;t
                                                <em>there</em> yet, then
                                                we&#8217;ll certainly
                                                <em>get there</em> soon.
                                                It&#8217;s only a matter of
                                                time, the writing is on the
                                                wall. Depending on the project
                                                you might have to put in
                                                workarounds, but we should keep
                                                those concerns out of
                                                architecture decisions.
                                                Maintaining crazy hacks is
                                                <em>not</em> worth it.
                                                There&#8217;s so many terrible
                                                hacks that have turned into
                                                frameworks, and frameworks that
                                                have justified themselves
                                                because of the problems they
                                                solved that no longer
                                                matter&#8230; Node.js deserves
                                                better than to be one of those.

                                                I&#8217;m not saying Node.js is
                                                <em>bad</em>. There are other
                                                arguments for it, and you
                                                don&#8217;t need to make
                                                <em>any</em> argument for it if
                                                you just feel like using it.
                                                It&#8217;s fun to do something
                                                new. And I&#8217;m as optimistic
                                                about Javascript as anyone. But
                                                this one argument, I do not
                                                think it is very good.

                                            Many years ago I wrote a fairly
                                            straight-forward port of
                                            Python&#8217;s
                                            <a
                                                class="reference external"
                                                href="http://docs.python.org/library/doctest.html"
                                                >doctest</a

                                            to Javascript. I thought it was
                                            cool, but I didn&#8217;t really talk
                                            about it that much. Especially
                                            because I knew it had one fatal
                                            flaw: it was very unfriendly towards
                                            programming with callbacks, and
                                            Javascript uses a lot of callbacks.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            On a recent flight I decided to look
                                            at it again, and realized fixing
                                            that one flaw wasn&#8217;t actually
                                            a big deal. So now doctest.js really
                                            works. And I think it works well:
                                            <a
                                                class="reference external"
                                                href="http://doctestjs.org"
                                                >doctest.js</a
                                            >.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            I have yet to really use doctest.js
                                            on more than a couple real cases,
                                            and as I do (or you do?) I expect to
                                            tweak it more to make it flow well.
                                            But having tried a couple of
                                            examples I am particularly liking
                                            how it can be used with callbacks.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            Testing with callbacks is generally
                                            a tricky thing. You want to make
                                            assertions, but they happen entirely
                                            separately from the test

                                            but I&#8217;m fairly new to serious
                                            Javascript development so I&#8217;m
                                            trying to withhold judgement. The
                                            flow of the tests is a bit peculiar
                                            until you realize that it&#8217;s
                                            for async reasons. I&#8217;ll try to
                                            show something that roughly
                                            approximates a real test of an
                                            XMLHttpRequest API call:

                                            blocks you can have signals to the
                                            runner to wait for some result,
                                            either a timeout (which is fragile),
                                            or you can setup specific
                                            conditions.

                                            Another popular test runner is

                                            because it&#8217;s what jQuery uses,
                                            and my own impression is that QUnit
                                            is just very simple and so least
                                            likely to piss you off.

                                            confused me for a bit until I
                                            realized what they were really
                                            referring to stopping the
                                            <em>test runner</em>; of course the
                                            function continues on regardless.
                                            What will happen is that the
                                            function will return, but nothing
                                            will have really been tested &#8212;
                                            the
                                            <tt class="docutils literal"

                                            callback will not have been run, and
                                            <em>cannot</em> run until all
                                            Javascript execution stops and
                                            control is given back to the
                                            browser. So the test runner will use
                                            <tt class="docutils literal"
                                                ><span class="pre"

                                            to let time pass before the test
                                            continues. In this case it will
                                            continue once
                                            <tt class="docutils literal"

                                            is called. And
                                            <tt class="docutils literal"
                                                ><span class="pre"

                                            also makes it fail if it
                                            didn&#8217;t get at least one
                                            assertion during that interval
                                            &#8212; it would otherwise be easy
                                            to simply miss an assertion (though
                                            in this example it would be okay
                                            because if the success callback
                                            isn&#8217;t invoked then

                                            With doctest.js you still get a
                                            fairly linear feel &#8212;
                                            it&#8217;s similar to how Jasmine
                                            works, except every
                                            <tt class="docutils literal"
                                                ><span class="pre">$</span></tt

                                            prompt is potentially a place where
                                            the loop can be released so
                                            something async can happen. Each
                                            prompt is equivalent to
                                            <tt class="docutils literal"

                                            (though unless you call wait,
                                            directly or indirectly, everything
                                            will run in sequence).

                                            There&#8217;s also an implicit

                                            anything that is written must be

                                            makes the spy/mock object write out
                                            any invocations). This makes it much
                                            harder to miss something in your
                                            tests.

                                            There is a new format that I now
                                            prefer with plain Javascript and
                                            &quot;expected output&quot; in
                                            comments.
                                            <cite
                                                >Spy(&quot;search.success&quot;,
                                                {wait: true, ignoreThis:
                                                true})</cite
                                            >
                                            causes the test to wait on the Spy
                                            immediately (though the same pattern
                                            as before is also possible and
                                            sometimes preferable), and in all
                                            likelihood jQuery will set
                                            <cite>this</cite> to something we
                                            don&#8217;t care about, so
                                            <cite>ignoreThis: true</cite> keeps
                                            it from being printed. (Or maybe you
                                            are interested in it, in which case
                                            you&#8217;d leave that out)

                                            I&#8217;ve never actually found
                                            Python&#8217;s doctest to be a
                                            particularly good way to write docs,
                                            and I don&#8217;t expect any
                                            different from doctest.js, but I
                                            find it a very nice way to
                                            <em>write</em> and
                                            <em>run</em> tests&#8230; and while
                                            Python&#8217;s doctest is
                                            essentially abandoned and lacks many
                                            features to make it a more humane
                                            testing environment, maybe
                                            doctest.js can do better.

                                            I find myself working in a Windows
                                            environment due to some temporary
                                            problems with my Linux installation.
                                            In terms of user experience Windows
                                            is not terrible. But more notable,
                                            things mostly just feel the same. My
                                            computing experience is not very
                                            dependent on the operating
                                            system&#8230; <em>almost</em>. Most
                                            of what I do is in a web browser
                                            &#8212; except programming itself.
                                            Probably a lot of you have the same
                                            experience: web browser, text
                                            editor, and terminal are pretty much
                                            all I need. I occasionally play with
                                            other tools, but none of them stick.
                                            Of course underlying the terminal
                                            and text editor UI is a whole host
                                            of important software &#8212;
                                            interpreters, version control tools,
                                            checkouts of all my projects, etc.
                                            So really there&#8217;s two things
                                            keeping us from a browser-only
                                            world: a few bits of UI, and a whole
                                            bunch of tools. Can we bridge this?
                                            I&#8217;m thinking (more
                                            speculatively than as an actual
                                            plan): could I stay on Windows
                                            without ever having to
                                            &quot;use&quot; Windows?
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            Browsers are clearly capable of
                                            implementing a capable UI for a
                                            terminal or editor; not a trivial
                                            endeavor, but not impossible. We
                                            need a way of handling the tools.
                                            The obvious answer in that case is a
                                            virtual machine. The virtual machine
                                            would certainly be using Linux, as
                                            there&#8217;s clear consensus that
                                            if you remove the UI and hardware
                                            considerations and just consider
                                            tools then Linux is by far the best
                                            choice &#8212; who uses Mac servers?
                                            And Windows is barely worth
                                            mentioning. I worked in a Linux VM
                                            for a while but found it really
                                            unsatisfying &#8212; but that was
                                            using the Linux UI through a VMWare
                                            interface.

                                            So instead imagine: you start up a
                                            headless VM (remembering the tools
                                            are not about UI, so there&#8217;s
                                            no reason to have a graphical user
                                            interface on the VM), you point your
                                            browser at this VM, and you use a
                                            browser-based developer environment
                                            that mediates all the tools (the
                                            lightest kind of mediation is just
                                            simulating a terminal and using
                                            existing console-based interfaces).
                                            Look at your existing setup and just
                                            imagine a browser window in place of
                                            each not-browser-window app you are
                                            using.

                                            I&#8217;m intrigued then by the idea
                                            of adding more to these interfaces,
                                            incrementally. Like HTML in the
                                            console, or applications lightly
                                            wrapping individual tools. IDEs
                                            never stick for me, maybe in part
                                            because I can&#8217;t commit, and
                                            also there&#8217;s collaboration
                                            issues with these tools (I&#8217;m
                                            never in a team where we would be
                                            able to agree on a single
                                            environment). But incremental
                                            decentralized improvements seem
                                            genuinely workable &#8212;
                                            improvement more in the style of the
                                            web, the browser providing the
                                            central metaphor.

                                            I call this a Browser Desktop
                                            because it&#8217;s a fairly
                                            incremental change at this point and
                                            other terms (Web OS, Cloud OS) are
                                            always presented with unnecessarily
                                            hyperbole. What &quot;operating
                                            system&quot; you are using in this
                                            imagined system is a somewhat
                                            uninteresting semantic question; the
                                            OS hasn&#8217;t
                                            <em>disappeared</em>, it&#8217;s
                                            just <em>boring</em>. &quot;The
                                            Cloud&quot; is fine, but too easy to
                                            overthink, and there are many
                                            technical reasons to use a hybrid of
                                            local and remote pieces.

                                            is hard at work on an editor worthy
                                            of being used by programmers. The
                                            browser needs to be an extremely
                                            solid platform. Google Chrome has
                                            done a lot in this direction, and

                                            will help with some kinds of
                                            services that ideally will connect
                                            directly to a port; it&#8217;s not
                                            the same as a raw socket, but I feel
                                            like there&#8217;s potential for
                                            small intermediaries (e.g., imagine
                                            a Javascript app that connects to a
                                            locally-hosted server-side app that
                                            proxies to ssh). Also AddOns can be
                                            used when necessary (e.g.,

                                            I&#8217;d like much better
                                            management of all these
                                            &quot;apps&quot; aka pages aka
                                            windows or tabs &#8212; things like
                                            split screens and workspaces.
                                            Generally I think using such a
                                            system heavily will create all sorts
                                            of interesting UI tensions. Which
                                            might be annoying for the user, but
                                            if it&#8217;s a constructive
                                            annoyance&#8230;

                                            On the whole&#8230; this seems
                                            doable. It&#8217;s navel gazing in a
                                            sense &#8212; programmers thinking
                                            about programming &#8212; but one
                                            good thing about navel gazing is
                                            that programmers have traditionally
                                            been quite good at navel gazing, and
                                            while some results aren&#8217;t
                                            generally applicable (e.g., VM
                                            management) the exercise will
                                            certainly create many generally
                                            applicable side products. It would
                                            encourage interesting
                                            itch-scratching. There&#8217;s lots
                                            of other &quot;web OS&quot; efforts
                                            out there, but I&#8217;ve never
                                            really understood them&#8230; they
                                            copy desktop metaphors, or have
                                            weird filesystem metaphors, or
                                            create an unnecessarily cohesive
                                            experience. The web is not cohesive,
                                            and I&#8217;m pretty okay with that;
                                            I don&#8217;t expect my experiences
                                            in this context to be any more
                                            cohesive than my tasks are cohesive.
                                            In fact it&#8217;s exactly the lack
                                            of cohesiveness that interests me in
                                            this exercise &#8212; the browser
                                            mostly gives me the level of
                                            cohesiveness I want, and I&#8217;m
                                            open to experimentation on the rest.
                                            And maybe the biggest interest for
                                            me is that I am entirely convinced
                                            that traditional GUI applications
                                            are a dead end; they rise and fall
                                            (mobile apps being a current rise)
                                            but I can&#8217;t seriously imagine
                                            long term (10 year) viability for
                                            any current or upcoming GUI system.
                                            I&#8217;m certain the browser is
                                            going to be along for the long haul.
                                            Doing this would let us Live The
                                            Future ;)

                                            I&#8217;ve yet to see another
                                            testing system for local web testing
                                            that I like as much as
                                            <a
                                                class="reference external"

                                                >WebTest</a
                                            >&#8230; which is perhaps personal
                                            bias for something I wrote, but then
                                            I don&#8217;t have that same bias
                                            towards everything I&#8217;ve
                                            written. Many frameworks build in
                                            their own testing systems but I
                                            don&#8217;t like the abstractions
                                            &#8212; they touch lots of internal
                                            things, or skip important steps of
                                            the request, or mock out things that
                                            don&#8217;t need to be mocked out.
                                            WSGI can make this testing easy.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            There&#8217;s also a hidden feature
                                            here: because WSGI is basically just
                                            describing HTTP, it can be a means
                                            of representing not just incoming
                                            HTTP requests, but also outgoing
                                            HTTP requests. If you are running
                                            local tests against your application
                                            using WebTest, with just a little
                                            tweaking you can turn those tests
                                            into HTTP tests (i.e., actually
                                            connect to a socket). But doing this
                                            is admittedly not obvious; hence
                                            this post!

                                            work over HTTP.

                                            The thing that got me thinking about
                                            this is the work I&#8217;m doing on

                                            >, where I am taking apps and
                                            rearranging the code and modifying
                                            the database configuration ad setup
                                            to fit this deployment system. It
                                            would be really nice having done
                                            that to be able to run some
                                            functional tests, and I really want
                                            to run them over HTTP. If an
                                            application has tests using
                                            something like Selenium or Windmill
                                            that would also work great, but
                                            those tools can be a bit more
                                            challenging to work with and
                                            applications still need smaller
                                            tests anyway, so being able to reuse
                                            tests like these would be most
                                            useful.

                                                Studies in Common Lisp</a
                                            >. One of the things I am noticing
                                            is that Lisp traditionally has a
                                            terrible lack of sentinels: special
                                            objects denoting some kind of
                                            meaning. Specifically in Common Lisp
                                            the empty list and false and nil are
                                            all the same thing. As a result
                                            there&#8217;s all these cases where
                                            you want to distinguish false from
                                            empty, especially when false
                                            represents a failure of some sort.
                                            In these AI examples, usually a
                                            failure to find something, while in
                                            many cases the empty list could mean
                                            &quot;the thing is already found, no
                                            need to look&quot;. But
                                            there&#8217;s also lots of other
                                            examples when this causes problems.

                                            More modern languages usually
                                            distinguish between these objects.
                                            Python for instance has
                                            <tt class="docutils literal"
                                                ><span class="pre">[]</span></tt
                                            >,

                                                ><span class="pre"
                                                    >False</span
                                                ></tt
                                            >
                                            and
                                            <tt class="docutils literal"
                                                ><span class="pre"
                                                    >None</span

                                            &quot;falsish&quot;, but if you care
                                            to tell the difference it is easy to
                                            do; especially common is a test for
                                            <tt class="docutils literal"
                                                ><span class="pre">x</span>
                                                <span class="pre">is</span>
                                                <span class="pre"
                                                    >None</span
                                                ></tt
                                            >. Modern Lisps also stopped folding
                                            together all these notions (Scheme
                                            for example has
                                            <tt class="docutils literal"
                                                ><span class="pre">#f</span></tt

                                            for false as a completely distinct
                                            object, though null and the empty
                                            list are still the same). XML-RPC is
                                            an example of a language missing
                                            null&#8230; and though JSON is
                                            almost the same data model, it is a
                                            great deal superior for having null.
                                            In comparison no one seems to care
                                            much one way or the other about
                                            making a strong distinction between
                                            True/False and 1/0.

                                            These are all examples of sentinels:

                                            state. None doesn&#8217;t
                                            <em>mean</em> anything in
                                            particular, but it means lots of
                                            things specifically. Maybe it means
                                            &quot;not found&quot; in one place,
                                            or &quot;give me anything I
                                            don&#8217;t care&quot; in another.
                                            But sometimes you need more than one
                                            of these in the same place, or None
                                            isn&#8217;t entirely clear.

                                            One thing I noticed while reading
                                            some Perl 6 examples is that
                                            they&#8217;ve added a number of new
                                            sentinels. One is
                                            <tt class="docutils literal"
                                                ><span class="pre">*</span></tt
                                            >. So you could write something like
                                            <tt class="docutils literal"
                                                ><span class="pre"
                                                    >item(*)</span
                                                ></tt
                                            >
                                            to mean &quot;give me any item, your
                                            choice&quot;. While the Perl
                                            tendency to use punctuation is
                                            legend, words work too.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            I wonder if we need a few more
                                            sentinel conventions? If so what?
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            Of course any object can become a
                                            sentinel if you use it like that,
                                            None isn&#8217;t
                                            <em>more</em> unique than any other
                                            object. (None
                                            <em>is</em> conveniently available
                                            everywhere.)
                                        </p>
                                        <p>

                                            happens to be a function, but
                                            it&#8217;s also a unique named

                                            too weird to do

                                            would be an appropriate input,
                                            making it a good sentinel.

                                            benchmark, despite some criticisms.
                                            But it benchmarks what everyone
                                            benchmarks: serving up a trivial app
                                            really really quickly. This is not
                                            very useful to me. Also, performance
                                            is not to me the most important
                                            differentiation of servers.

                                            that decision (mostly because of

                                            servers, and it manages its children
                                            (the same way Apache manages all its
                                            children). So if a child stops
                                            responding, it gets taken out of the
                                            pool and killed (brutal efficiency!
                                            Or at least brutal terminology).
                                            Child processes are also recycled,
                                            guarding against memory leaks or
                                            other peculiarities. Sometimes these
                                            kinds of things are dismissed for
                                            covering up bugs, but (a) production
                                            is a lousy time to learn about bugs,
                                            (b) it&#8217;s like a third tier of
                                            garbage collection, and (c) the bugs
                                            you are avoiding are often bugs you
                                            can&#8217;t fix anyway (for
                                            instance, if your mysql driver leaks
                                            memory, is that the application

                                            I wish there was competition among
                                            servers not to see who can tweak
                                            their performance for entirely
                                            unrealistic situations, but to see
                                            who can implement the most fail-safe
                                            server. We&#8217;re missing good
                                            benchmarks. Unfortunately benchmarks
                                            are a pain in the butt to write and
                                            manage.

                                            The hardest part of writing this is
                                            not the applications (they are
                                            simple). One annoyance is wiring up
                                            the applications, but handily
                                            Nicholas covers that well in

                                            >. You also have to make sure to
                                            clean up, as many servers will not
                                            exit cleanly from some of the tests.
                                            Another nuisance is that some of
                                            these require funny clients. These
                                            aren&#8217;t too hard to write, but
                                            you can&#8217;t just use

                                            Anyway: I would
                                            <strong>love it</strong> if someone
                                            did this, and packaged it as
                                            repeatable/runnable code/scripts.
                                            I&#8217;ll help some, but I
                                            can&#8217;t lead. I&#8217;d both
                                            really like to see the results, and
                                            in my ideal world people writing
                                            servers would start using these
                                            benchmarks to make their servers
                                            more robust.
