                                            beyond the typical attackers &#8212;
                                            people committing identity theft,

                                            imagined are serious risks, and the
                                            attacks that are taking place are
                                            far less sophisticated than we

                                                protest, they felt people should
                                                make their own choices about how
                                                to protest. The choices people
                                                made were widespread, ranging
                                                from staying in a &quot;free

                                                and in a very small number of
                                                cases some people committed
                                                property damage. The Welcoming
                                                Committee did not advocate any
                                                particular kind of protest, they
                                                would not be their
                                                brother&#8217;s keeper, nor did

                                                of protest as too timid. Each
                                                person should act on their own

                                                case has been coming out.
                                                It&#8217;s been over a year and
                                                a half and only now are we
                                                getting any indication of what
                                                the <em>real</em> claims are
                                                against the defendants, though
                                                the prosecution continues to
                                                avoid presenting any real case
                                                or plausible complaint.

                                                also learning something about
                                                the form of the investigation.
                                                The FBI was closely involved
                                                with the case and recruited the
                                                most active informant, and the
                                                primary investigator was
                                                previously with the Secret
                                                Service (which

                                                great deal of national attention
                                                on the convention. So presumably
                                                they had the resources to
                                                investigate seriously if they
                                                wished to do so.

                                                From the perspective of online
                                                security the case is very
                                                boring. The defendants have been
                                                given all the evidence collected
                                                during the investigation
                                                (including benign or even
                                                helpful evidence). It&#8217;s a
                                                huge amount of evidence, and
                                                hard for them to understand or
                                                sort through, but some kinds of
                                                investigation aren&#8217;t
                                                there. No email accounts were
                                                subpoenaed. Their computers were
                                                all confiscated, and will no
                                                doubt be kept until after the
                                                trial, but there&#8217;s nothing
                                                high-tech about that. Some of
                                                them had whole-disk encryption,
                                                and there is no indication it
                                                was broken nor were they even
                                                asked to provide passwords.
                                                There&#8217;s also no evidence
                                                of sniffing internet
                                                connections, tapping phones,
                                                breaking into email&#8230;
                                                nothing fancy was done.

                                                would have been out of line with
                                                their ideals and would have made

                                                techniques you used in the
                                                process. But only if
                                                there&#8217;s a smoking gun.
                                                It&#8217;s a peculiar situation
                                                where the prosecution
                                                doesn&#8217;t appear to actually
                                                believe they did anything
                                                demonstrably wrong; I fear they
                                                plan a case where they redefine
                                                &quot;wrong&quot;.

                                                Besides the security issue
                                                there&#8217;s the privacy issue,
                                                and privacy is big on the
                                                internet these last few months.
                                                One of the oft-claimed benefits
                                                of privacy is to allow political
                                                dissent. And maybe that makes
                                                sense in China, but I
                                                don&#8217;t know how it relates

                                                sense of privacy. On the
                                                playground you might say you
                                                like They Might Be Giants and
                                                the playground bully says
                                                <em>that&#8217;s so gay</em>,

                                                making a pointed critique on

                                                trying to hurt you. The only way
                                                privacy will help you is if you
                                                are <em>so quiet</em> that the
                                                bully doesn&#8217;t notice you
                                                at all and picks on someone else
                                                instead. That&#8217;s a pathetic

                                                Gaertner&#8217;s run for the
                                                Democratic gubernatorial
                                                nomination never went anywhere,
                                                I suspect in large part because
                                                she wasn&#8217;t brave enough to
                                                show her face at public events
                                                in the Twin Cities because she
                                                was consistently protested over
                                                this case. I doubt this has
                                                influenced the prosecution (at
                                                least in any positive way), but
                                                it&#8217;s satisfying.
