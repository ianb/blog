                So, for the last
                <a class="reference" href="http://chipy.org">ChiPy</a> meeting I
                gave a
                <a
                    class="reference"
                    href="https://ianbicking.org/docs/pytest-presentation/pytest-slides.html"
                    >presentation</a
                >
                on
                <a

                    href="http://svn.colorstudy.com/home/ianb/pytest_roman/test_roman.py"

                the
                <a
                    class="reference"
                    href="http://diveintopython.org/unit_testing/romantest.html"
                    >Dive Into Python unittest example</a
                >. Along the way I found what I thought was a good use of
                decorators to provide multiple parameters for a testing
                function. Without decorators this is what it would look like:
            </p>
            <pre class="literal-block">
known_values = [(1, 'i'), (2, 'ii'), ...]
def test_to_roman():
    for integer, numeral in known_values:
        yield real_test_to_roman, integer, numeral
def real_test_to_roman(integer, numeral):
    assert roman.toRoman(integer) == numeral
</pre
            >
            <p>
                That's not bad (easier than unittest, to be sure), but here's
                the decorator I made, for equivalent effect:
            </p>
            <pre class="literal-block">
def param(param_list):
    def decorator(func):
        def yielder():
            for params in param_list:
                yield (func,) + params
        return yielder
    return decorator

&#64;param(known_values)
def test_to_roman(integer, numeral):
    assert roman.toRoman(integer) == numeral
</pre
            >
            <p>
                I thought, oh! how clever I am to come up with this example of
                decorators just when Python 2.4 is coming out, and to tie it
                into the month's topic (testing). I expected everyone to say
                <em>my, how easy and useful these decorators are!</em>
            </p>
            <p>
                I didn't get quite that reaction. And I must admit, when people
                weren't sure what this did, my explanation made it clear this
                wasn't going to be immediately intuitive to people. This is more
                or less the explanation I gave:
            </p>
            <blockquote>
                The decorator line -- the line with the at sign -- is an
                expression that is evaluated. In this case the expression
                returns a function. Then it gets called with the function, and
                returns a generator function, and that generator function is
                what the name of the original function is bound to. Ta-da!
            </blockquote>
            <p>
                I actually went on longer than that, hoping that by noting that
                the original function is still around (bound to
                <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">func</span></tt
                >) and describing the order of execution and a couple other
                things that it would magically become clear. It probably only
                made it worse.
            </p>
            <p>
                I hope with a little thought and visual inspection that people
                can figure out the
                <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">param</span></tt>
                decorator -- I think it will be a common pattern for decorators.
                Maybe the
                <a
                    class="reference"
                    href="http://www.python.org/doc/2.4/whatsnew/node6.html"
                    >what's new</a
                >
                document will be easier to understand. There's a real benefit to
                writing your own decorators; this particular example is only
                useful for tests, and only for py.test tests at that. I expect
                other domains to call for other decorators -- indeed, we are
                seeing a lot of clever uses of them in the
                <a
                    class="reference"
                    href="http://aspn.activestate.com/ASPN/Python/Cookbook/"
                    >Python Cookbook</a
                >. They don't provide any new functionality, but they make a
                certain pattern <em>feel</em> much nicer.
            </p>
            <p>
                But when it comes to explaning a decorator, it's clearly
                difficult. This was the same problem I've had explaining
                <a
                    class="reference"
                    href="http://www.python.org/peps/pep-0333.html"
                    >WSGI</a
                >, which also involves lots of functions that return functions
                and call functions and whatnot. I think coming up with better
                names than &quot;a function&quot; will be important. In this
                case, emphasizing that
                <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">param</span></tt>
                <em>builds</em> a decorator, which we call &quot;decorator&quot;
                (not &quot;a function that takes a function and returns a
                function&quot;). And maybe instead of &quot;yielder&quot; it
                should be &quot;replacement_func&quot; or something. I'm finding
                the use of language becomes very important when dealing with
                higher-order functions.

                <strong>Update</strong>: There was quite a bit of discussion on
                the ChiPy mailing list about this, and perhaps some resolution
                and understanding. You can start reading the thread
