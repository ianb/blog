                I saw two presentations on the second day of PyCon which
                interested me in combination, one on
                <a class="reference" href="http://schevo.org/">Schevo</a> and
                another on
                <a
                    class="reference"
                    href="http://www.mems-exchange.org/software/durus/"
                    >Durus</a
                >. I've always been reluctant about object databases. ZODB...
                well, it works, and I'm sure it works well -- I haven't really
                had problems -- but it doesn't make me feel safe.
            </p>
            <p>
                This isn't because of integrity or stability issues as much as
                data stability, portability, upgradability, queriability (is
                that a word?) I want to be able to ask questions about my data
                (like, say, how many people registered in a certain date range),
                questions that I didn't think about when I was setting up my
                data. And I want to control how my data changes as my
                application and the data itself evolves; generally it should be
                easy, and it should always be possible --
                <tt class="literal"
                    ><span class="pre">ALTER</span>
                    <span class="pre">TABLE</span></tt
                >
                and other operations (like multi-record
                <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">UPDATE</span></tt
                >) mostly do that well in an RDBMS.
            </p>
            <p>
                Schevo is a fairly restricted object model built on top of a
                database. It builds indexes and relations and maintains
                integrity for you, and seems to have some conventions to control
                upgrades. These are all the aspects of an RDBMS that I care
                about... well, at least most of the things I care about.
            </p>
            <p>
                Schevo is really just the schema -- it builds on top of an
                object database (Pypersyst, Durus, or ZODB). Which is where
                Durus comes into play -- Durus is kind of a simpler
                reimplementation of ZODB. The only real way that ZODB sounded
                better was that it's threadsafe, so you can run it in process in
                a threaded environment. But Durus is client-server -- like ZEO
                (the client-server extension to ZODB) -- and that's good enough
                for me.
            </p>
            <p>
                I like an RDBMS for many of its practical advantages -- it's
                really good infrastructure. But I'm not in love with them. I
                want data that can last for years and across systems; that
                doesn't have to be an RDBMS. Right now that's practically the
                only good option -- XML persistence is another option, or some
                other simple flat-file systems, but those are painful to work
                with. I still don't feel good about object databases, but at
                least this feels like a move in the right direction.

                    I'm trying to wrap my head around some of these issues also.
                    I'm working on two projects now that both use RDBMS
                    backends. One of them seems like a natural for using an
                    OODB. It's a DB of network devices (routers, switches, APs,
                    etc) and I've built my own simple ORM for it (could have
                    used SQLobject, I know!). In many places, I already act like
                    I'm using an OODB. E.g. instead of using crafted SQL to pull
                    specific devices out of the DB, I loop over them all
                    ('SELECT * from devices'), wrap each row up as an object
                    instance, then check attributes on them to find matches
                    (device.Model == 'Router M10'). I'll be examining this one
                    to see how well something like durus could replace MySQL. I
                    imagine it would be quite easy.
                </p>
                <p>
                    OTOH, the second DB is much larger and I think of as
                    containing dumb data. A few well crafted indexes and queries
                    are used to dump out search results as quickly as possible.
                    There's nothing OO about it.

                    For what it's worth whenever I've dabbled with OODBs I
                    haven't been able to quickly answer questions which involve
                    aggregation, and I always want to do that to a greater or
                    lesser extent. You know, the sort of queries like &quot;Give
                    me all of the transactions in the third quarter last year
                    over five thousand dollars from suppliers in Western
                    Australia&quot;
                </p>
                <p>
                    This is the strength that catapulted relational databases
                    over and above their network and hierarchial competitors in
                    the 70's and 80's. Removing the need to re-organise your
                    data when you want to look at it in a slightly different way
                    made a big difference in the real world where change is the
                    only constant. When object databases crack it (perhaps with
                    a consistent query language) then I confidently predict
                    adoption will skyrocket.

                    There is a lively thread on this very subject on the db-sig
                    mailing list, look for 'Pycon2005 and database divide' at
                    this page:
