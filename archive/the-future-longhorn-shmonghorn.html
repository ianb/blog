            <a href="http://www.sauria.com/blog/">Ted Leung</a> brings up some
            important points and collects some good links in his
            <a href="http://www.sauria.com/blog/2003/11/13#676">latest post</a>.
            To quote:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            Once they [MS] get everything into
            <a href="http://www.developer.com/net/cplus/article.php/1756291#M"
                >managed code</a
            >, people working in predominantly unmanaged environments are going
            to be hard pressed to keep up.
        </blockquote>

        While I agree with the general sentiment, I think the FS/OSS communities
        aren't being left behind, but they aren't doing it by following a
        commercial effort. To me, Python is the response to managed code (maybe
        one of several responses, but I also believe the most important
        response).

        <p>
            Right now I believe Python is a clear forerunner among high-level
            languages. It might be elitist, but I don't consider Perl to be high
            level, or to be a successful general application development
            language; PHP is both low level and still solidly server-side;
            Object C has some newfound potential, but it still skirts the high
            level/low level border... which leaves Java (2500 projects
            <a href="http://freshmeat.net/browse/160/?topic_id=160"
                >on Freshmeat</a
            >
            as opposed to 1200 Python projects). I'll let you decide on Java's
            potential on your own. (I know why I like and can distinguish Python
            from Java, I don't know why I would distinguish C#'s "managed code"
            from Java's model -- which isn't necessarily praise of Java!)
        </p>

        <p id="eventual-goal">
            Anyway, to return to our topic, I see high level languages as the
            future for development. At the same time, using Python we don't have
            to forgo our low level roots by using C extensions (the old Worse is
            Better cliche [truism?]). This layered system gives us the potential
            to build wonderful and beautiful new things, without reimplementing
            every little thing everytime we make another go at figuring out what
            "beautiful" means. I see the goal as a place where, struck with a
            notion for a new program (novel or just customized) a developer can
            implement, reimplement, refactor, and redesign quickly. Our
            applications come and go, they become important and obsolete over
            time -- but as long as our fundamental foundation becomes further
            enriched, further refined, even just further understood we will
            still have accomplished something. I imagine the wonderful
            applications emerging from our communities as a matter of course --
            when the prerequesites have been created, those applications will
            appear, and their emergence will seem more inevitable than dramatic.
        </p>

        <p>
            I think high level languages have made significant progress as well.
            Python programs are popping up all over the place, both in core
            tools and end-user applications. (And it's probably about time
            people start dropping the "py" prefix from application names -- it's
            like a qualifier, and the time has come that appications don't need
            to be qualified by this implementation language, Python has become a
            basic piece of the OS infrastructure, not a novel prerequisite)
        </p>

        <p>
            Python programming also makes backward compatibility issues very
            manageable. The core has been successfully backward compatible, and
            even when there are issues with third-party library compatibility it
            is usually quite easy to work around those issues (much like Python
            makes it easy to work around OS differences). Python provides all
            the fundamental tools to handle problems as they come up -- things
            like exceptions, introspection, or even the crudeness of
            <tt>sys.path</tt> manipulation to get known versions of libraries.
            (Relatedly, I believe Javascript's greatest flaw has not been its
            lack of standardization, but the lack of the fundamental programming
            constructs to work around those problems) I believe Python provides
            (<i>right now</i>) a much more robust and flexible technology for
            platform independence than found in Java (and probably .NET) -- I
            think the same will be revealed in terms of backward compatibility.
        </p>

        <p>
            Which is all to say: I'm optimistic. People complain that we just
            copy commercial software and designs -- but if you think we should
            do more you should look for the ways people are <i>already</i>
            innovating, not expect the open source/free software community to
            innovate in the same way as commercial development. Our path has
            <i>always</i> been dramatically different than Microsoft's, and it's
            gotten us this far.

            One of the biggest problem for dynamic language (say python) is
            design time support.
            <br />
            For example, in C#, after you define the
            <br />
            datatype for ISomething, when you type the
            <br />
            variable name, the editor can pop up a list
            <br />
            of functions that are available for this
            <br />
            variable. In python, you have to look up
            <br />
            the document to see what function is supported since datatype is
            determited at
            <br />
            runtime. The same is true for a good
            <br />
            GUI builder system.

            That's why you should develop most of your Python code in the
            interactive interpreter, which CAN show you the auto-complete
            information (PyCrust does a particularly good job of this, and
            IPython is very neat as well). It gives you the additional benefit
            of testing every single line of code as you write it. Once you've
            got it working right, copy it in to your editor.

            While I agree with most of what you've said and would like to agree
            with the rest, I have to say that backwards compatibility has been a
            nightmare. This is not because the language hasn't been generally
            backwards compatible, but because of the internals and install.
            <br />

            <br />
            When you upgrade Python on a Red Hat Linux box, everything may stop
            working. It turns out that the 'python' in the path is now
            /usr/lib/python2.2 (or whatever) which doesn't have the same
            site-packages. Fine, try to find the same packages and re-install
            them. Oops, half of them aren't recompiled for 2.2/2.3, etc.
            Recompile? You can copy the packages to the new site-packages
            directory, but then you get warnings (must go turn those off *in the
            code?!* or in another site.py!) and sometimes crashes.
            <br />

            <br />
            The C interface is terrible. The old style/new style dichotimity is
            a nightmare. (Note to people starting a new language project: Make
            sure you plan for binary upgrades.)
            <br />

            <br />
            We need a "final" binary format that will allow the C code to be
            upwards compatible, not forcing new versions to be backwards
            compatible. That's looking at the problem backwards.
            <br />

            <br />
            Once that is accomplished, we need a *global* site package directory
            that all versions can use.
            <br />

            <br />
            New versions should *replace* old versions, not co-exist. (Obviously
            co-existing should be supported, but the old version should be moved
            from the "default" install.)
            <br />

            <br />
            I'm sure there's more -- this is off the top of my head.

            .NET (and C#) is not so bad
            <br />

            <br />
            As far as I understood the .NET framework, they mixed up Java,
            Python and C++ and tried to get the best out of each language. The
            framework itself seems to be very powerful, since it lets a
            developer decide, which language he will actually use. In a year or
            two, the Python .NET project will be able to convert Python Code to
            the intermediate language as well.
            <br />
            I am happy about all this, because this would make our life in the
            *bad* windows world hopefully so much easier in the future!
            <br />
            Imagine no more COM, but clear and easy-to-use interfaces to
            Windows!
            <br />
            For example, if a Windows C# Developer must have to write a
            interface to an Python-Application, this should be easy to solve
            with .NET.
            <br />
            But to be honest: I myself do not believe, that .NET works, because
            Windows itself is a pain.
