        <p>Fuck.</p>

        <p>
            Well, I can take just a little solave that in
            <a
                href="http://www.cnn.com/ELECTION/2004//pages/results/states/IL/index.html"
                >my state</a
            >
            the Democrats continue to improve their status, gaining a national
            senate and house seat. And we didn't enact any anti-gay messures.
            Cook County (mostly Chicago) was 80% in favor of Kerry.
        </p>

        <p>
            The senate race here was downright pleasant. A little background:
            Obama wasn't the preferred candidate in the primary, but won
            handily. Republicans quickly abandoned their first candidate due to
            a sex scandal. He wasn't polling well anyway, so I think they gave
            up quickly. The runner up in the Republican primary had used
            anti-immigrant commercials; he tried to get the nomination, but the
            party leaders denied him. In part it's because he was going counter
            to Bush's immigrant policy, but I also think it's because the
            Republicans didn't want to be branded as racists. Then they bring in
            Keyes, a hopeless candidate, but also a way to throw a bone to their
            most conservative members. But they just ended up alienating their
            moderate members; they even left Keyes off the Republican voter
            guide that they sent to us.
        </p>

        <p>
            Obama himself is a very progressive Democrat. He came out against
            the war before it started, and even spoke at anti-war rallies. While
            his overwhelming success (70% to 27%) was in large part due to the
            incompetence of his opponents, I think he would have won even
            against a viable opponent. So that's nice.
        </p>

        <p>
            But still, fuck. It struck me yesterday, before any polls had closed
            or results had come in, how nice it would be if Kerry won. It would
            feel like we were in a civilized nation again. But we aren't. We're
            still fucking barbarians.

            Barbarians?
            <br />
            Yes, I think we are, but for different reasons. I've lurked for the
            past few months listening to your anti-Bush rhetoric - because
            you're such a great python programmer. But I've disagreed all the
            way.
            <br />

            <br />
            You call the situation in Iraq barbarianism? I call abortion
            barbarianism. Guess we don't see eye to eye. A civilized nation
            under Kerry? A civilized nation doesn't eat their young to satisfy
            their selfish cravings.
            <br />

            <br />
            Oh well, it's pleasant to see that myself and a few other million
            'evangelical Christians' got out and voted. Who would have thought
            the election would come down to moral issues? :)
            <br />

            <br />
            And no, I'm not trolling. You mentioned in a previous post that you
            couldn't understand why anyone would support Bush. It's a different
            set of morals and priorities, 'tis all.
            <br />

            <br />
            btw, I used to live in Naperville. It's a shame to see Ill. go the
            way it has...
            <br />

            <br />
            Hey, now that it's over, can you get back to posting about python?
            Top notch stuff you put up about programming. Top notch.

            Thanks Ian,
            <br />

            <br />
            FWIW, I feel a tiny bit better after reading someone else with a
            similar sense of well-merited disgust at the current political state
            of the USA. And I suppose it encourages me to take a similar slight
            solace at also living and voting in a moderately civilized state
            (Massachusetts)--our state house became even more overwhelmingly
            democratic; and we have some quite good congressional reps: Frank,
            Markey, my own Olver, and Sen. Kennedy.
            <br />

            <br />
            There was something nice about reading something on a Python/techie
            blog that was especially encouraging. I read a number of liberal
            political commentary sites, and I expect to read what I do there.
            But to see a ray of humanity's better side somewhere else entirely
            is a nice thing.
            <br />

            <br />
            But still: F*ck! How come the country I live in can't show the a
            greater modicum of intelligence and decency. Four more years of tax
            dollars paying to drop bombs on Iraqi children! (And also the
            crackdown on civil liberties, of course; and insane fiscal policy;
            and fundamentalist xtianiaty being enshrined as a "state religion").

            <br />
            My state went for Kerry as well (Oregon). Unfortunately we also went
            for the anti-gay vote. After years of defeating moronic anti-gay
            amendments, the fuckers found one wrapped in satin the average voter
            could fall for.
            <br />

            <br />
            Humorously, one could interpret the amendment as prohibiting a
            heterosexual from remarrying. I hope someone figures out how to
            enforce that. Meanwhile we face years and millions of dollars
            enacting legislation piecewise toward providing moderate civil
            rights to gay couples.
            <br />

            Homosexuality. Can't make it okay, man. What do you think
            Christian's are going after with these laws? Do you think we're just
            trying to make others obey our rules? Power tripping? Got nothing
            better to do?
            <br />

            <br />
            Here's the skinny, straight up. It's <b>easy</b> to sit back and let
            others go down whatever road they wish. It's <b>easy</b> to just
            take care of yourself. It's easy, in the name of <b>freedom</b> to
            tell others - hey, just do whatever you want. It's okay by us.
            <br />

            <br />
            However, understand the plight and burden of the Christian. In my
            heart, honestly speaking, I carry the knowledge that a life without
            Christ is one that will not see eternal life. You may not have the
            same conviction. If so, you'll completely disagree with everything I
            say. But with this knowledge, I see around me millions of people who
            are dying and going to hell. It pains me so. What do I do about it?
            Well, I attempt to share the good news of Jesus Christ and our need
            for a savior. Along with that, I attempt to show others the sin in
            their life and the consequences of it. Homosexuality is a sin -
            according to God's word, not my own petty and oft incorrect
            feelings. If I sit back in my cozy little recliner and take the
            attitude of others who don't care about anyone else (freedom, man,
            let them do what they want), then I become an accompliance to their
            doom.
            <br />

            <br />
            ""And have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but
            rather expose them. For it is shameful even to speak of those things
            which are done by them in secret.""
            <br />

            <br />
            I am commanded by my Lord to do so. Granted, in a loving manner, but
            I am commanded to do so.
            <br />

            <br />
            My goodness man, I'm not trying to impose my will on someone. I'm
            trying to help them see the problem possessing them - one that
            desparately needs addressing. Creating laws that make sin right
            according to man's ideals have devestating consequences eternally.
            <br />

            <br />
            I ask myself, do I honestly believe the Bible entirely, word for
            word? Yes. Because of that, I'm trying to help these people. I don't
            hate them. I don't find them repulsive. I don't wish them to be
            outcast by society or discriminated against. But I cannot sit by and
            call wrong right when the effect it has will lead people to
            everlasting suffering.
            <br />

            <br />
            Check it out:
            <br />

            <br />
            Romans 6:23
            <br />
            For the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life
            in Christ Jesus our Lord.
            <br />

            <br />
            Romans 3:23
            <br />
            for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God
            <br />

            <br />
            Romans 5:8
            <br />
            But God demonstrates His own love toward us, in that while we were
            still sinners, Christ died for us.
            <br />

            <br />
            Luke 13:3
            <br />
            I tell you, no; but unless you repent you will all likewise perish.
            <br />

            <br />
            Believing this, how can I possibly vote for a law labeling sin as
            being right? How can someone repent if they don't know they're doing
            wrong? That would be the ultimate betrayal of my fellow man.
            <br />

            <br />

            Hopefully your country is still far from being intolerant. But seen
            from here (Europe) it looks like the secularisation of the state is
            really in danger.

            <br />
            So the difference between barbarians and civilization is 150,000
            Ohio voters? I think you're painting with a very broad brush there.

            Well, we <i>are</i> barbarians either way, because we all knew it
            was going to be close to 50/50. But will the nation <i>act</i> like
            barbarians? This came down to 150k Ohio voters.
