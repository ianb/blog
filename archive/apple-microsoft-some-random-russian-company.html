        <h1>Apple, Microsoft, Some Random Russian Company</h1>
        <p>
            So, now there's all these stories about Microsoft entering the
            business of online music. Will it be better or worse than Apple? I
            can't say I'm happy with Apple. The songs are overpriced, and I
            personally can't burn my songs anymore -- somewhere in one of the
            upgrades it lost my key. I contacted support, but they ignored me. I
            admit I haven't tried very hard, but I can't help but feel that
            they've stolen something from me. Bottom line: digital restriction
            management sucks. It's fundamentally shitty, and it's still shitty
            when Apple does it. Will it be more or less shitty with Microsoft? I
            don't know, but I am 100% certain it will still be shitty.
        </p>

        <p>
            Should we even care? So, there's this company,
            <a href="http://allofmp3.com">AllOfMP3.com</a>, that sells
            unencumbered audio. It's a Russian company, with a license to sell
            the music from a Russian copyright agency. Is it legal for me, a US
            citizen, to buy this music? If it is legal, is there any reason why
            iTMS should even exist, when compared to this vastly superior
            competitor?
        </p>

        <p>
            I've tried them out. The rate is $0.01/Mb, or about $0.70 for an
            album (with my settings), encoded in whatever format and bitrate I
            choose. It all works pretty smoothly. The selection is a bit odd
            (they have a ton of Frank Zappa; I guess it's an Eastern European
            thing), but it's reasonably extensive, and they add 10-15 albums a
            day.
        </p>

        <p>
            In
            <a href="http://www.technewsworld.com/story/34512.html"
                >this interview</a
            >
            of the AllOfMP3 CIO, he emphasizes that the service is intended for
            Russian users, though maybe that's just the story he needs to tell.
            <a
                href="http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2004/05/17/1084646114240.html?oneclick=true"
                >This article</a
            >
            claims that AllOfMP3.com is illegal (in Australia); specifically
            that ROMS (a Russian equivalent of ASCAP or BMI) doesn't have the
            right to authorize the music. ROMS
            <a href="http://www.museekster.com/romsinterview.htm"
                >claims otherwise</a
            >
            of course. Do I, as a consumer, need to worry about any of this? If
            I buy the music in good faith, isn't that good enough?
        </p>

        <p>
            Of course, it's not quite that clear -- it feels like a loophole, at
            best. There's a certain pleasure in this; if corporations can shop
            around in various countries for low wages, poor environmental
            controls, etc, then can't I shop around for permissive copyright
            laws? At the prices AllOfMP3 charges, there can't be a lot of money
            going to licensing, but then they have to compete against widespread
            CD piracy in Russia, and I'm guessing pirated CDs are in the $1-$3
            range(?) So the prices make sense in Russia, even if they seem
            suspiciously low for the US.
        </p>

        <p>
            Lastly, there's the ethical question. Not "am I stealing from the
            record labels?", I couldn't give a damn about that. Plus it's not
            stealing, since I'm clearly not taking anything from anyone. But
            there is the issue of the artists. I somehow doubt that the estate
            of Frank Zappa is getting regular royalty checks from ROMS (though
            maybe I'm wrong). The RIAA doesn't have the interest of the artists
            in mind either, so I'm not enthusiastic about either alternative.
            I'm also okay with the idea that I may not support every artist I
            like, and I may not support them in every transaction, but if
            ultimately I'm supporting musicians in a sustainable way, that it's
            ethical. If no one is really offering a complete, ethical manner to
            support artists while enjoying their works, is there a balance I can
            create as an individual?
        </p>

        <p>I'm interested in hearing other people's thoughts.</p>

            AOM seems to be legal in the US (the RIAA said they won't pursue any
            of its users). The only reason they don't have the entire online
            music downloading marketshare is because they have absolutely no
            marketing in the western countries and people believe it is to good
            to be true.

            One possible alternative, although everyone says this and no-one
            does it, is to listen to music not made by famous artists. There's
            places like
            <a href="http://mperia.com/" target="_blank">http://mperia.com/</a>
            and so on serving up this sort of thing. Obviously, there's the
            issue of finding good music from that without the radio to help
            out...

            Lo Ian.
            <br />

            <br />
            I read a couple of posts here in France about the AOM. In france
            this is clearly illegal. In fact AOM buy the right for songs at the
            Russian Price. So they can resell it in Russia, that's all. So if
            they sell songs out of Russia, they can be sue by record's company.
            And worst, in france, the record company can sue the people's too
            because they own music that doesn't pay the rights for that. This
            has never happen, but ..

            The going rate for a pirate CD in Moscow was about three or four
            dollars when I was there a couple of years go. There's a huge market
            my girlfriend (Russian) goes to to stock up whenever she's in town.

            Is it illegal if I go to russia and buy (legit) CD's there and take
            them home with me? What about if I go to russia and download them
            onto my laptop there? I guess I am probably liable for import duty,
            but isn't this equivalent to buying cheap CDs from Amazon.com and
            having them posted to the UK.

            BTW, for people who have problems downloading from AOM, you can just
            copy the links into a text file, and run:
            <br />

            <br />
            for LINE in `cat linkfile.txt` ; do wget $LINE ; done
            <br />

            <br />
            I believe wget is standard on Mac OS X, so this should work well.
            You don't have to be logged in to download the files; I assume the
            links are personalized in some fashion.

            I guess you just discover the new promotional from emusic.com. I
            haven't join but, but while browsing the website, i discover that
            they sell my favorite bands for great price. For example, some rare
            Sonic Youth album are sell at ~30$ here in France, because it's a
            'import'. So emusic sells them without any extra cost .
