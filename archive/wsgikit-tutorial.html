                In other news... I really hate the name WSGIKit. Ideas for
                something else? I also want WSGIKit to be larger than just
                Webware, for it to be a set of infrastructure for use with
                several frameworks.
            </p>

                >, so I won't let it get out of date, but it also uses doctest
                to build the files, highlight the source, etc. I do this by
                putting doctest commands inside Restructured Text comments. This
                is in contrast to the SQLObject documentation, where I had a
                bunch of ad hoc scripts, and it's gotten painfully out of date
                with the code. When I have a chance to revisit that
                documentation, I hope to use this same technique when I revisit
                the SQLObject documentation.

                    WSGI puts me in mind of &quot;gateway&quot;. Grepping for
                    'gatew' turns up &quot;gateworks&quot; (already a PCB
                    company by that name) and &quot;gatewise&quot;; the latter
                    might be good.

                <p>
                    A meta-name might be &quot;Framework&quot;; everyone who
                    Googles for &quot;Python web framework&quot; will probably
                    get the WSGIkit page as their first hit.

                    I actually don't care about the &quot;WSGI&quot; part at all
                    -- that's an implementation detail which is important to me,
                    but shouldn't be important to people using it. I also don't
                    want it to appear as Yet Another Framework. It's more like a
                    framework for frameworks. Metaframework? But that makes it
                    sound much fancier than it actually is -- it's not More
                    Abstract than a normal framework, it's mostly just glue and
                    configuration.

                            Definitely, when you've got your 'underware' (yes, I
                            know, sic), everything fits better, feels better, is
                            sorted out properly. Other things can go over it. It
                            plays off of Webware, but implies both an underlying
                            change and an underlying protocol. And the logo
                            could be, well, a lot of fun, given the right
                            mindset. Marketing it could be fun, too.

                            You could also extend the metaphor -- call it
                            'Knickers' or something.

                    No, <strong>WSGI</strong> isn't tied to much of anything.
                    <strong>WSGIKit</strong>, which is built on WSGI but isn't
                    the same as WSGI, also isn't tied to anything. On top of
                    WSGIKit (and distributed with it) I've built Webware
                    interfaces, and on top of the Webware interfaces I've built
                    ZPT integration, but neither Webware nor ZPT get any special
                    privileges from the lower layers. And in fact, most of the
                    actual code (not including the application setup and
                    configuration) would run just fine on Webware 0.8.1.

                        Though my Python mind is currently soaked in PyGTK I
                        thought it might be fun to try porting the rendering
                        portion of your todo example to XSL (because I also want
                        an excuse for trying out ElementTree). A 'download this
                        example' archive link failed to bite my nose. Yes, I
                        could cut and paste and save from the tutorial. It might
                        be faster and easier to download a Ruby On Snails video
                        instead. ;)

                                    In future it may be useful to consider
                                    usability in all actions, adding obvious

                                    so interested parties can get it all in a

                    Yes, it includes full pages inline, rendered from the actual

                    out everything but the body, but I didn't get around to it.
