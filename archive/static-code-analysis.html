            What's the real reason I get ClassCastExceptions? Because I refactor
            a lot. After a refactoring the wrapper class to use B instead of A
            you might be putting a type B into the collection and incorrectly
            casting it to the old A in a wrapper class method
        </blockquote>

        James Robertson replies:

        <blockquote>
            You don't have this problem in Smalltalk because it's not the sort
            of problem you tend to get yourself into, period. Say I had a
            collection holding Foos. If I refactor, and I end up having a
            collection holding Bars (completely incompatible), then I have
            bigger problems. Even so, I would have had to refactor all the
            surrounding code that accesses the collection elements - and if I
            didn't have tests under those circumstances, I'm in trouble whether
            I have static typing or dynamic typing. To be brutal, if you trust
            the compiler to solve this for you, then you shouldn't be writing
            code.
        </blockquote>

        <p>
            Well, that's a little harsh. While Ryan Lowe's specific examples
            don't really apply to a dynamically typed language, the idea is
            valid. Refactoring tools are easier to write and more reliable with
            static typing. A tool can analyze statically typed code and say with
            some confidence exactly where a class or method is used -- in
            Smalltalk, Python, or other dynamically typed languages, refactoring
            is just a string match. Good naming practices can make that string
            search more reliable, but it's still just strings, not a fully
            type-annotated source.
        </p>

        <p>
            This is one of those unfortunate places where you can't have it both
            ways. Dynamic typing and late binding is resistant to static
            analysis, and static analysis can be used for good things. (And
            Python is actually more resistant than most dynamic languages.)
        </p>

        <p>
            It would be interesting in these dynamic languages if you could
            assert a type (or interface) not just at runtime, but in a way that
            can be statically determined. I don't know if programmers would
            bother to put in those assertions reliably enough to make it useful,
            or if the assertions would ultimately become fragile and unwieldy.
            Maybe a more appropriate goal would be to watch the code as it runs
            (particularly unit tests) and view types there; then while you
            wouldn't be absolutely guarenteed that you have correct type
            information, you'd usually have good information for analysis. We do
            this for JIT and other optimizations, but I haven't seen it used a
            great deal as a programming tool.
        </p>

        <p>
            Still, while static typing isn't useless, it is rather limited. You
            can say "float", but you can't say "float between 0 and 1,
            inclusive". Contracts are a more general idea, with much more
            potential for error detection. Static analysis of contracts would be
            very interesting indeed.

            Yes, yes, I know no real refactoring tool works on the source as
            text. Even Real Programmers don't call <tt>sed</tt> a refactoring
            tool ;) But it is working on the source in a relatively isolated
            manner, where only the name is available, and that name is compared
            as a string. Whereas in Java the name can be fully identified as a
            particular method of a particular class.
            <br />

            <br />
            Re: Ada; the problem with this is that the limited operators
            available don't work well for complicated systems. You can have
            number ranges. What about only odd numbers? What about invariants?
            What about objects that can have many valid states, but must be in a
            particular state when passed to a specific function? That's more
            restrictive than an interface, but a very common restriction.
            Realistic requirements are complex enough to require a full
            language, not a limited type definition language.

            <br />
            Before we move the goal-posts, are we agreed that for the last 25
            years, in a mainstream language, we've been able to say "float
            between 0 and 1, inclusive"?

            The AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) is just a data structure describing
            the source. It may lose a bit of information (e.g., whitespace), or
            it may not. It's not magic, it carries no extra information. It's
            very handy when you need to programmatically read the source, but it
            doesn't endow any special powers or information that original text
            didn't already have. But that's the same as what Java is doing, too,
            it's just that the Java source contains some pertinant information
            that Python or Smalltalk does not contain. So "text" vs. "whatever
            it is Java uses to represent source" is probably a bad way of
            describing the difference. It's really a question of what kind of
            reasoning you can do given the source.
            <br />

            <br />
            As far as Ada, sure. But then, it was an example of a statically
            defined contract -- while Ada satisfies the example, that's not a
            case of contracts. I don't know much about Ada, so maybe it does
            provide all this contractural information, but whatever it is, it's
            more complex than can be expressed in terms of types.

            One of the problems of static type checking in Python would be the
            plasticity of runtime introspection. Take, for example, one of my
            favorite ways to generically wrap methods, used in the example of a
            constructor:
            <br />

            <br />
            <tt>
                <br />
                def __init__(self, *args, **kargs):
                <br />
                superclass.__init__(self, *args, **kargs)
                <br />
            </tt>
            <br />

            <br />
            There are countless places where this is desirable, such as dynamic
            xmlrpc servers or object brokers, or meta programming. I would say
            that overall, the plasticity of Python will forever prevent any kind
            of meaningful type checking.
            <br />

            <br />
            An alternative I would prefer to subclass based type checking would
            be interfaces. Checking to make sure an object passed implements an
            "iterable" interface instead of checking to see if it's a list or it
            has whatever methods you use.

            Typechecking and Typechecking are different things. You have a full
            spectrum of different ideas when you look at type systems. You can
            have fully manifest typing (as Python or Smalltalk have) and still
            can have usefull type informations - by using type inference. So
            actually the ASTs a refactoring tool can be enriched by information
            that goes beyound the source. Type inference isn't thant new -
            several Lisp implementations use it to optimize their code. Of
            course you could it to make better refactoring tools, too.
            <br />

            <br />
            Of course it is more problematic to have enriched information for
            refactoring in fully dynamic languages with strong focus on manifest
            typing. But it's still up for discussion wether that really is
            needed. By gut feeling I would go with James Robertsons assertion
            that static typing in the long run doesn't help. But then, I do
            Smalltalk since somewhere in the 80s and Lisp since the end of the
            80s, so I am a bit biased.
            <br />

            IMO people are mixing apples and orange. the fact that Java's type
            ssytem sux does not imply that all static typing systems should be
            like that. Nice is a nice example of a type system where you add
            very little informations to those that can be inferred
            automagically.
            <br />

            <br />
            Also, I won't bet that you can't define an Even or Odd class in
            haskell, it should be something like:
            <br />
            class Even n where check_even :: n
            <br />

            <br />
            I think we must face the simple law that actual "dynalanguages" like
            python or ruby are just a mix of
            <br />
            1 simplicity
            <br />
            2 expressivity
            <br />
            3 large simple+expressive libraries
            <br />

            <br />
            and that static typed languages that provide #1 and #2 massively
            lack #3.

            String matching would not distinguish a local variable or instance

            My understanding of the Refactoring tools (Smalltalk and otherwise)
            is that they are operating on the same level of information the
            compiler operates on: it does distinguish between a class named X, a
            method named X, a local variable named X, etc.
            <br />

            <br />
            There is a danger when strings (perhaps read from an external file)
            are used to look up classes, methods, or whatever... the exact same
            danger exists in Java. On the other hand, C++ doesn't have any way
            to go from a string to a class or method, so it's "safe", though the
            syntax of C++ is so hairy, and the lack of reflection such a big
            problem, that there are no refactoring tools for C++ yet. [I hear
            one is in development, but that's it.]

            isaac: I don't think so. The java library is an overengineered beast
            and I won't say that it is simple and expressive. This is a side
            effect of it being a library for an "enterprise" language like java.
            <br />
            The scripting attitude is to ignore details and have something
            working even if it's not 'perfect', while the java lib pushes the
            "do it the exact way, then bother about pleasure of use" mood.
            <br />

            <br />
            Anyway I have to specify that #1 and #2 are provided from many
            static languages but a static inference able to encompass the
            expressivity of python/ruby/whatever is yet to come. I bet it is
            possible, just not yet done.
            <br />
            i.e I'm not sure but IIRC in nice you still had to specify an ad hoc
            interface explicitly, or can this be inferred automagically?
            <br />
            I'm sorry I don't know Scala enough to comment on it. I was just
            confused from seing it has traits+mixins :)
