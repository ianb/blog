                    >this interesting conversation</a
                >, it occurs to me that RESTful encapsulation is being limited
                to one request, stateless, and pushing a lot of data into one
                HTTP call. I think this is too limiting. Encapsulation is nice,
                but if you are willing to give up synchronous completion of the
                encapsulated activity, then multiple requests aren't so bad.
            </p>
            <p>
                The example that came up in that conversation is an ecommerce
                site. In that model, the product pages can and probably should
                be RESTish. But the ordering process isn't so much. There's
                multiple steps. A variable number of steps probably, and
                sometimes you have to go back a step (e.g., invalid credit
                card). It's interactive, and highly stateful. Not very REST,
                maybe good for continuations.
            </p>
            <p>
                Well, lets pick that apart some more. The items you purchase are
                all RESTy. Everyone sees the same items.
            </p>
            <p>
                The shopping cart is pretty easy to imagine in a REST form. You
                pop things in, you pop things out.
            </p>
            <p>
                OK, so the user hits &quot;checkout&quot;, and you grab the cart
                contents from the REST cart. And you grab the HTML
                representation of the contents from the cart. And then you have
                an &quot;app&quot; that lets you see the total, remove things,
                etc. Is that app REST? No... I don't even know exactly what that
                would mean if it was REST. This is where I think people can go
                down the cargo cult path, because they are looking at how to
                make that RESTy, and so they worry about what the URI for the
                delete action looks like.
            </p>
            <p>
                But if you step back just a bit, that app can look RESTish too.
                You tell the app where the cart is. You tell the app what to do
                when you are finished. Then the app is a service; when you send
                the user's browser over to the app, you are calling that
                service, and you'll get your response when the app directs the
                user's browser to the next step in the process.
            </p>
            <p>
                Unlike what is typically described as a service, attaining the
                result -- an actual checkout -- takes many requests, not one.
                And it involved the user's browser. But it <em>can</em> be
                encapsulated. So can the payment, and other pieces. Is the
                result going to be as tweaked out as Amazon's checkout form?
                Probably not; the application boundaries might be quite
                noticeable to users (though there is progress to be made there,
                and Ajax techniques can help a great deal). The user might not
                be able to edit all the pieces at once. There's probably a bunch
                of glue; glue is overhead, RESTful or not.
            </p>
            <p>
                And that form/app for actually managing your shopping cart
                contents? Yeah, that can be continuation based. But
                <em>why</em>? It's not a complex application, you don't need a
                clever framework. Once you have a clever framework you're going
                to mix these problems together and solve them all at once,
                because you have to justify the framework, and there's no way in
                hell you can do that for some silly little form that lets you
                change what's in your cart.
            </p>
            <p>
                Maybe there needs to be some language for non-service-oriented
                REST; REST where the browser is a peer, not just a viewer into
                the consolidation of services on the server side. Or another
                term, maybe &quot;REST&quot; shouldn't be overloaded so much.
                But something... browser-based web services?

                    I got that feeling too. I think the original concept was
                    that state should either be stored on the client or on the
                    server <em>as a resource</em>. There's no rule that says you
                    can't have state on the server, just that it should be
                    behind a distinct resource / URL.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I'd argue that processes like this illustrate RESTs
                    strengths quite well since they use
                    <em>hypermedia as the engine of application state</em>. The
                    next/previous links driving the process either way
                    illustrate this fundamental aspect of RESTful interaction. I
                    believe your point was that most continuation based
                    frameworks break a few rules when they keep state on the
                    server in the form of stack frames as opposed to moving
                    everything back to the client but that's just one aspect of
                    REST.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You can build stateful processes using REST, you just have
                    to put state behind URIs if you're storing it on the server,
                    which as you've pointed out is often the better solution.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I don't see how that's not RESTy? If a user's cart has a
                    distinct resource on the server and the items in the cart
                    also have distinct resources and manipulating the items in
                    the cart use basic RESTful interaction what's not RESTy?
                    REST doesn't mean a set / constant / global resource space
                    that can never be modified. It just means that everything
                    important should have a distinct URL. The URL can be ugly:
                </p>
                <pre class="literal-block">
http://shopping.com/cart.php?user=ianb
</pre
                >
                <p>That's completely RESTful. Here's what's not:</p>
                <pre class="literal-block">
http://shopping.com/cart.php
</pre
                >
                <p>
                    ... and then relying on session state or cookies to
                    determine whose cart it is.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The delete action doesn't have a URL - the item has a URL.
                    The delete action is an interaction and it looks like this
                    with AJAX/other capable HTTP client libraries:
                </p>
                <pre class="literal-block">
DELETE http://shopping.com/cart.php?user=ianb&amp;item=3452 HTTP/1.1
</pre
                >
                <p>It looks like this with forms:</p>
                <pre class="literal-block">
POST http://shopping.com/cart.php?user=ianb&amp;item=3452 HTTP/1.1
...

action=delete
</pre
                >
                <p>
                    I think the key thing to take away from all this is that
                    state on the server is fine as long as you're putting it
                    behind a URI and then allowing the client to modify it using
                    the universal interface.

                    See, this is where I'm getting the feeling that you've been
                    reading the wrong material on REST. If you're reading stuff
                    that says REST is about &quot;invoking services&quot; using
                    name/value pairs instead of posting XML (WS), then that shit
                    is just wrong. I don't understand where the insinuation that
                    the client is just a &quot;viewer&quot; or that the server
                    is exposing &quot;services&quot; is coming from. None of
                    this is based in REST. REST is all about simple resource
                    representations, identified by unique identifiers (URLs),
                    interlinked using references to each other, and manipulated
                    using a small and universal set of basic verbs. REST is
                    &quot;resource oriented&quot;, not &quot;service
                    oriented&quot;. There's no concept of a &quot;service&quot;,
                    it's resources all the way down.

                        Or whatever other details come from the way the HTML
                        form is designed. Oldschool HTML forms are okay, but
                        they do often mean tight coupling between the form and
                        the action. So the RESTful, stable interface isn't the
                        delete action (at least not the one the management app
                        uses), it's some other interface.

                        &quot;services&quot; is coming from. None of this is
                        based in REST. REST is all about simple resource
                        representations, identified by unique identifiers
                        (URLs), interlinked using references to each other, and
                        manipulated using a small and universal set of basic
                        verbs. REST is &quot;resource oriented&quot;, not
                        &quot;service oriented&quot;. There's no concept of a
                        &quot;service&quot;, it's resources all the way down.

                        I don't think the cart management app will be RESTful,
                        nor do I see any reason it needs to be. It just doesn't
                        matter. It doesn't really matter what the HTML forms are
                        that the cart management uses. When you check out, you
                        redirect the user to that app. When they are finished
                        managing, the management app redirects them to the next
                        step. What happens between those doesn't matter. Nobody
                        should care if the management app uses RESTful
                        principles internally.

                        Browser-based APIs are more concerned about where the

                            Well... maybe I didn't figure out quite what my
                            point was there. The point of a cart management app
                            is that it speaks to the browser, it speaks POST and
                            HTML. It interacts. It's not an atomic resource,
                            it's really an interactive application that speaks
                            to a browser. There's no resource there.

                            I see what you're saying now. The example above is
                            actually still RESTful in that you're not breaking
                            any hard rules directly (so long as those name/value
                            pairs are in a POST body and not on a GET/URL). I
                            think we're 1.) tripping into the area of
                            taste/style and 2.) trying to determine whether
                            manipulating resources directly is preferable to
                            manipulating resources using what the Atom
                            Publishing Protocol calls &quot;collection
                            resources&quot;. e.g. You can post to a
                            &quot;collection resource&quot; and manipulate
                            multiple other resources as a result. There's
                            nothing in REST that disallows or even discourages
                            this that I'm aware of. As you've shown, this is an
                            extremely common practice on the web circa 2006.

                            I think I'm getting a better idea of the behavior
                            you're labeling cargo cultish though. I don't think
                            it's REST, I think it's more like &quot;individual
                            resource orientedness&quot; or something; the idea
                            that every interaction must be performed through
                            specific individual resources, that interactions on
                            collection resources are &quot;bad style,&quot; and
                            that URLs that look like
                            &quot;shopping.com/ianb/cart&quot; offer substantial
                            benefits over URLs that look like
                            &quot;shopping.com/cart.php?user=ianb&quot;. I think
                            it's fairly safe to call these principals misguided
                            if not harmful.

                            It matters if there's value in interacting with the
                            cart items outside of the one simple cart interface
                            page. For example, if the cart had an
                            &quot;API&quot; or if you wanted a cart that
                            contained items from 5 different shopping sites, or
                            if you just wanted to remove or view cart items on
                            an item-by-item basis, etc. But all of these
                            scenarios require some additional requirement beyond
                            the basic shopping cart page so one could argue that
                            building out a full resource hierarchy is a form of
                            pre-mature optimization and breaks basic principals

                            from a bit better and I'd agree that the resource
                            based approach should be used because it's valuable,
                            not because it's cool.
