                I posted this to
                <a
                    class="reference"
                    href="http://www.python.org/community/sigs/current/distutils-sig/"

                >
                as a kind of rambly brainstorm. I will subject you all to it
                too. If you don't care about Python installation, you most
                certainly won't care about this post; be warned!
            </p>
            <p>
                So, I'm coming back to the idea of a working environment, an
                isolated and more-or-less self-contained environment for holding
                installed packages. We discussed this a fair amount at PyCon.
            </p>
            <p>
                I'm assuming such an environment will be encapsulated in a
                single directory, looking something like:
            </p>
            <pre class="literal-block">
env/
   bin/
   lib/python2.4/
   src/
   conf/
</pre
            >
            <p>
                The
                <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">conf/</span></tt>
                directory doesn't really relate to much of this specifically,
                but in many situations it would be useful. Depending on the
                situation, other subdirectories may exist.
            </p>
            <p>
                Each of the scripts in
                <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">bin/</span></tt>
                should know what their working environment is. This is slightly
                tricky, depending on what that means. If it is a totally
                isolated environment -- no
                <tt class="docutils literal"
                    ><span class="pre">site-packages/</span></tt
                >
                on
                <tt class="docutils literal"
                    ><span class="pre">sys.path</span></tt
                >
                -- then I feel like the script wrappers have to be shell
                scripts, to invoke Python with
                <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">-S</span></tt>
                (which is hard to do portably on the
                <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">#!</span></tt>
                line). I don't know the details of doing the same thing on
                Windows, but I assume it is possible. The actual directory
                location should be portable -- all paths should be relative, and
                you should be able to move the directory around.
            </p>
            <p>
                <tt class="docutils literal"
                    ><span class="pre">lib/python2.4/</span></tt
                >
                is for packages. I'm almost inclined to say that
                <tt class="docutils literal"
                    ><span class="pre"
                        >--single-version-externally-managed</span
                    ></tt
                >
                makes sense on some level, with a record kept in some standard
                place (<tt class="docutils literal"
                    ><span class="pre"
                        >lib/python2.4/install-record.txt</span
                    ></tt
                >?) -- but I'm basically indifferent. I at least don't see a
                need for multiple simultaneous versions in this setup, and
                multiple versions do lead to confusion. Version metadata is
                still nice, of course.
            </p>
            <p>
                <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">src/</span></tt>
                is for checkouts, where each package is installed with
                <tt class="docutils literal"
                    ><span class="pre">setup.py</span>
                    <span class="pre">develop</span></tt
                >. These are naturally single-version, which is part of why I
                like the idea of only using single-version setups. I'm a little
                unsure of how
                <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">src/</span></tt>
                should be layed out. In practice I want all &quot;my&quot;
                packages to be installed in
                <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">src/</span></tt>
                as checkouts, either from tags or the trunk (or a branch or
                whatever). Even in the case of tags, a checkout can be turned
                into a branch fairly easily. So I'm not sure if I should name
                the subdirectories after the package, or maybe even the package
                plus a tag name.
            </p>
            <p>
                One of the things SwitchTower (now &quot;Cappucino&quot;, I
                think) does in Rails land is it makes a dated checkout, then
                activates that checkout (it does that with a symlink; we'd do it
                with
                <tt class="docutils literal"
                    ><span class="pre">setup.py</span>
                    <span class="pre">develop</span></tt
                >). It then rolls back by switching to an existing checkout. Of
                course svn switch + svn up does this in place, and with less
                checkout trash laying around, even if rollbacks aren't as fast
                as a result. So, I'm thinking just
                <tt class="docutils literal"
                    ><span class="pre">src/PackageName/</span></tt
                >, or whatever convention you felt like (e.g.,
                <tt class="docutils literal"
                    ><span class="pre">src/PackageName-branchname/</span></tt
                >)
            </p>
            <p>
                There's an installation issue with checkouts -- it would be nice
                if I could say &quot;these are the packages I want to install as
                editable&quot; and
                <tt class="docutils literal"
                    ><span class="pre">easy_install</span></tt
                >
                would pick those up (maybe detecting based on what package index
                the package was found in) and install them in
                <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">src/</span></tt>
                as editable.
            </p>
            <p>
                Anyway,
                <tt class="docutils literal"
                    ><span class="pre">sys.path</span></tt
                >
                would contain
                <tt class="docutils literal"
                    ><span class="pre">/usr/lib/python2.4</span></tt
                >
                (or Windows equivalent),
                <tt class="docutils literal"
                    ><span class="pre">env/lib/python2.4/</span></tt
                >
                and <em>optionally</em>
                <tt class="docutils literal"
                    ><span class="pre"
                        >/usr/lib/python2.4/site-packages</span
                    ></tt
                >, and all the similar directories. Unfortunately figuring out
                what &quot;similar&quot; directories there are is hard. sys.path
                on my machine now has 63 entries normally and 12 with
                <tt class="docutils literal"
                    ><span class="pre">python</span>
                    <span class="pre">-S</span></tt
                >. I guess I'd really like to start with 12 and build up,
                instead of 63 and try to strip them down.
            </p>
            <p>
                Installation as a whole is an open issue. Putting in
                <tt class="docutils literal"
                    ><span class="pre">env/setup.cfg</span></tt
                >
                with the setting specific to that working environment works to a
                degree --
                <tt class="docutils literal"
                    ><span class="pre">easy_install</span></tt
                >
                will pick it up if invoked from the
                <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">env/</span></tt>
                directory. But that doesn't work with
                <tt class="docutils literal"
                    ><span class="pre">setup.py</span>
                    <span class="pre">develop</span></tt
                >, or
                <tt class="docutils literal"
                    ><span class="pre">setup.py</span>
                    <span class="pre">install</span></tt
                >, or some other scenarios. The system
                <tt class="docutils literal"
                    ><span class="pre">distutils.cfg</span></tt
                >
                doesn't really work, because the only expansion it knows how to
                do is of user directories, so there's little way to pass
                interesting information in (like a &quot;this is my
                setup.cfg&quot; environmental variable or something). Maybe with
                <tt class="docutils literal"
                    ><span class="pre">$PYTHONPATH</span></tt
                >
                to indicate the working environment, and a distutils monkeypatch
                put into
                <tt class="docutils literal"
                    ><span class="pre"
                        >lib/python2.4/distutils/__init__.py</span
                    ></tt
                >? I played around with putting the path setup in
                <tt class="docutils literal"
                    ><span class="pre">sitecustomize</span></tt
                >, but that runs after
                <tt class="docutils literal"
                    ><span class="pre">site.py</span></tt
                >, and doesn't run at all if
                <tt class="docutils literal"
                    ><span class="pre">python</span>
                    <span class="pre">-S</span></tt
                >
                is used, so it seems like it brings in too much before it can
                remove stuff.
            </p>
            <p>
                Another option is a completely new python interpreter bound to
                the environment. Basically the
                <a
                    class="reference"
                    href="http://peak.telecommunity.com/DevCenter/EasyInstall#creating-a-virtual-python"
                    >virtual-python.py option</a
                >.
            </p>
            <p>
                In this model using
                <tt class="docutils literal"
                    ><span class="pre">env/bin/python</span></tt
                >
                indicates the proper environment, and you'd have local installs
                of <em>everything</em> including
                <tt class="docutils literal"
                    ><span class="pre">easy_install</span></tt
                >. This fixes so many problems without crazy hacks that it
                strongly appeals to me, especially if we can make it somewhat
                lighter. I get this
                <tt class="docutils literal"
                    ><span class="pre">/usr/lib/python2.4.zip</span></tt
                >
                on my path, a file that doesn't usually exist; if we could
                create that zip on demand and use such a big-bundle-zip, that
                seems lighter and faster and nicer, especially if shared. If we
                just put
                <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">.pyc</span></tt>
                files in the zip, and those
                <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">.pyc</span></tt>
                files refer back to the actual module source (in
                <tt class="docutils literal"
                    ><span class="pre">/usr/lib/python2.4/</span></tt
                >), then tracebacks should also still work, I believe? No actual
                symlinks either, so it should work on Windows. I'm not entirely
                sure where I'm going with this, though.
            </p>
            <p>
                So, by the end I'm thinking an improved
                <tt class="docutils literal"
                    ><span class="pre">virtual-python.py</span></tt
                >
                is what I'm looking for, as kind of the One True Way to do good
                Python installation and deployment.

                        Well, it <em>touches</em> nearly every aspect of

            <p>
                Your post got me to purse some of my own ideas about about
                deploying Python applications. I've written a small script,
                <a href="http://agni.phys.iit.edu/~kmcivor/potpourri/whisk"
                    >whisk</a
                >, that (ab)uses setuptools to build a working envrionment for
                deployment.
            </p>
            <p>
                You run <tt>whisk HelloWorld GoodByeWorld</tt> and get a working
                environment that contains HelloWorld and GoodByeWorld, their
                scripts, and all of their requirements.
                <tt>easy_install</tt> does the installation, so the arguments
                can be files, URIs, and requirements. The resulting scripts
                automatically find their envrionment's libraries based on the
                value of <tt>sys.path[0]</tt>. This is more along the lines of
                OSX Application bundles and CRL Assemblies than what you're
                talking about, but I thought it might give you some ideas.
            </p>
