                error messages should go. (It now occurs to me that maybe the
                form generation should get the errors from the validation
                instead of htmlfill). The form generator might be a person
                (totally customized and easily tweakable), or a template (e.g.,
                made with Cheetah or ZPT), or an HTML-generating model. All that
                matters is that it creates a form; and you can change the
                technique without changing the rest of the system.
            </p>
            <p>
                Then htmlfill takes it all and with its knowledge of HTML forms
                puts it together. Note that this is different from most
                templating languages. Some languages know about XML or HTML
                (e.g.,
                <a
                    class="reference"
                    href="http://dev.zope.org/Wikis/DevSite/Projects/ZPT/FrontPage"
                    >ZPT</a
                >) and some know only about text (e.g.,
                <a class="reference" href="http://www.cheetahtemplate.org/"
                    >Cheetah</a
                >); in this case we are very specifically looking for
                <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">input</span></tt>
                elements (and other similar elements), and saving all the extra
                annotation that might be necessary.
            </p>
            <p>
                (Note that I have a validation package, and I have htmlfill, but
                a form generator is left up to the reader.)
            </p>
            <p>
                The contrasting technique (the one that
                <a
                    class="reference"
                    href="http://svn.colorstudy.com/trunk/FormEncode/src/htmlview.py"
                    >formencode.htmlview</a
                >
                uses) is to do all of these at once -- you prepare the model,
                the defaults, maybe a previous request, the errors and pass them
                all in. Then you go through the widgets and they each render
                themselves, enclosed in some wrapper. I won't argue for why this
                doesn't work well -- if you've tried it (I have, a
                <a class="reference" href="http://funformkit.sourceforge.net/"
                    >couple times</a
                >) you probably know its limitations and complexities. This
                constrasting design doesn't even have &quot;widgets&quot;, just
                plain old HTML. Good riddance!

                <p>Hi Ian</p>
                <p>
                    This is an interesting little problem that i had to face
                    also a few weeks ago when I wrote part of a web application
                    framework. I took a really simple approach which works well
                    with my framework (I like simple things, this is one of the
                    reasons I like Python) and I will describe it below.
                </p>
                <p>
                    BTW, I find your log entry a little bit difficult to
                    understand for someone that is not familiar with your
                    formkit code, and I think the problem is interesting enough
                    that it deserves more details. It would be great if you
                    could write your thoughts in a self-contained document with
                    clearer definitions of the problem to be solved, etc. i.e.
                    not just a blog entry, but a design doc. Just an idea.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Here is how I solved it in my framework (this is tested code
                    and running in a web app).
                </p>
                <div class="section" id="components">
                    <h1><a name="components">Components</a></h1>
                    <p>
                        In summary, this problem can consists of separate
                        components which interact in well-defined ways, here are
                        the definitions of my components:
                    </p>
                    <ol class="arabic simple">
                        <li>
                            <em>form definition</em>: listing the names, types,
                            constraints and labels of the forms;
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <em>rendering a form</em>: this involves taking the
                            form definition, a set of initial values and
                            generating an output that represents the
                            corresponding HTML (or directly outputting HTML
                            text);
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <em>error markup</em>: taking potential errors from
                            a previous request adding markup to indicate errors
                            near the corresponding input fields;
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <em>validation</em>: taking the values sent from the
                            submit of a form and validating the constraints on
                            the widgets, potentially returning the user to the
                            form if there are errors;
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <em>conversion</em>: converting the string values
                            from the form submit to Python data types.
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                </div>
                <div class="section" id="rendering-html">
                    <h1><a name="rendering-html">Rendering HTML</a></h1>
                    <p>
                        Before I go on, I must mention that in my framework I do
                        not output HTML as I go. Instead, I build a tree of HTML
                        tags in memory (using a special, really really simple
                        library that I built for this purpose (<tt
                            class="literal"
                            ><span class="pre">htmlout</span></tt
                        >), I can provide it if you want); this allows me to
                        manipulate various parts of my document in any order
                        before rendering it, remove stuff, change attributes,
                        classes, etc.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Using this method, I build a custom Python class to
                        define a template for each of my page layouts. These
                        classes have methods for each layout component, e.g.
                        <tt class="literal"
                            ><span class="pre"
                                >add_sidebar_paragraph(text)</span
                            ></tt
                        >. This is a good way to force yourself to
                        &quot;design&quot; most of the layout upfront.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I very much prefer this approach to any of the billion
                        text templating systems because I can change parts of my
                        documents in any order, and I can add many
                        &quot;smarts&quot; to my template layouts. It's code,
                        it's dynamic, rather than blobs of text to be pasted
                        together. Note that this can only work out if I don't
                        collaborate with artists (which is my case at the
                        moment), i.e. you have to write Python code to generate
                        the HTML. I suppose if I did work with designers I would
                        have to hook a templating system in.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This might have had an impact on the design of my
                        system, but I think most of the ideas below still apply
                        with a usual templating system.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="section" id="form-definition">
                    <h1><a name="form-definition">Form definition</a></h1>
                    <p>
                        I defined a library with a &quot;widget&quot; object for
                        each type of entry (string, multi-line text, menus,
                        radiobuttons, file upload, date, etc.). In that library,
                        there is a &quot;form&quot; class that acts as a
                        container of these widgets. It can return the list of
                        labels, names, widgets, and can parse a dict with data
                        coming in from a request. If some validation fails it
                        raises an exception. After parsing, a new dict is
                        returned with the string input values converted into
                        Python native values (e.g. a datetime object, a unicode
                        string, a file buffer, etc.). This library contains no
                        rendering code.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div
                    class="section"
                    id="validation-conversion-and-signaling-errors-to-the-user"
                >
                    <h1>
                        <a
                            name="validation-conversion-and-signaling-errors-to-the-user"
                            >Validation, Conversion and Signaling Errors To The
                            User</a
                        >
                    </h1>
                    <p>
                        I wrote a simple convenience method that calls the form
                        parsing and catches the form error exception; if an
                        exception is raised, it sets a status message (in
                        per-session dat) for the next request to render (a
                        message to be written to the user), and serializes the
                        parsed input values (a dict) AND a list of error
                        fieldnames and error messages (a dict also) into
                        per-session data in a database. Then I redirect to the
                        render request(*).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Conversion occurs at the same time as validation. This
                        is for efficiency: oftentimes validation requires
                        conversion. I have not seen any problem with this
                        approach yet, since converting is always done at the
                        same time as validation. This is the first thing I do in
                        a form handler method (after authentication checks).
                    </p>
                    <dl>
                        <dt>
                            (*) Note: the redirect is not really necessary, I
                            suppose I
                        </dt>
                        <dd>
                            could save a request by calling the handler directly
                            with the values dict and error dict.
                        </dd>

                        I have separate renderer objects that implement
                        rendering using single-dispatch on the form widgets
                        (i.e.

                        >, etc.). I have three:

                                organize the inputs nicely and customize in a
                                way that usually cannot be figured out

                                I call something like:
                            </p>

     )
  )
</pre
                            >
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p class="first">
                                a &quot;display&quot; renderer that generates
                                tables for display purposes only, using the form
                                definition, and using again a sublist of
                                widgets/values to render. This is useful because
                                oftentimes you want to display the data and much
                                of the information about how to display it is
                                already encapsulated in the form.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                And since the renderers and the form definitions
                                are not dependent on each other, it is easy to
                                do that. I suppose I could add other types of
                                renderer if I can find other uses for the form
                                definition.

                    <p>
                        In all cases, I pass in the values dict that is read
                        from the per-session data and the renderer code knows
                        how to undo the conversion and fill in the values. There
                        is also a phase for the widgets to &quot;prepare&quot;
                        the input values before the renderer uses them. I use
                        this to undo some of the conversion.

                    <p>
                        A note about internationalization: if the form
                        definition occurs when loading the modules, the renderer
                        has to know to
                        <tt class="literal"
                            ><span class="pre">gettext()</span></tt
                        >
                        the labels before rendering them.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="section" id="error-markup">
                    <h1><a name="error-markup">Error Markup</a></h1>
                    <p>
                        When I want to &quot;render&quot; errors, the handler
                        code passes the HTML form tree generated by the code
                        above (including custom HTML formatting that is added to
                        make the form look good, sectioning, fieldsets, etc) to
                        an error renderer method.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        That renderer runs down the tree and finds the first
                        input that corresponds to an error field and inserts
                        appropriate marker HTML to indicate to the user where
                        the errors are located and adds some CSS classes to the
                        HTML inputs. I think this is equivalent to the
                        <tt class="literal"
                            ><span class="pre">htmlfill</span></tt
                        >
                        library, but it might be more efficient because I don't
                        need to &quot;parse&quot; the text. This happens before
                        flattening the form into text.

                        I agree with you that implementing these different
                        components separately is much better than a fully
                        integrated approach. It is also true that they pretty
                        much always interact in the same way.

                <div class="document">
                    <p>Thanks for the (very extensive!) comment.</p>
                    <p>
                        This sounds a lot like FunFormKit, which was an earlier
                        library I wrote; maybe it's a natural progression. In
                        that library the components were largely how you
                        describe, though error markup happened at the same time
                        as rendering. One major issue was how to deal with
                        dynamic forms. FFK had ways to do this, but it was
                        complex and non-intuitive, even for very
                        straight-forward forms of dynamicism (like dynamic
                        select boxes).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I wrote a small library to generate HTML, mostly for me
                        so I could get rid of a lot of HTML-related logic. The
                        layout was done similarly, but I now feel it's not
                        sufficient -- not just when you are working with a
                        designer, but for that last 10% of a project where you
                        start caring about the little things. I would feel a
                        need to make changes to the layout system for every new
                        form once I got to the last 10%, and that's no good --
                        the form library should be stable.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For signaling errors to a user, you definitely shouldn't
                        do a redirect or store the errors in a session object.
                        It's easier just to redisplay the form with the errors
                        inline, and make them re-POST the data. One trap to
                        avoid that FunFormKit fell into is overdesigning this
                        process -- let the application call into your library
                        and do the basic control, don't try to hijack the
                        request when an error occurs. That gets way to
                        complicated for no real gain.

                            Interesting. Could you write a short architectural
                            overview of the new system? I'm really interested to
                            find out about the differences in high-level design.

                        <p>
                            About the HTML generation library: the lib I wrote
                            is a simple mapping to xhtml, i.e. it can generate
                            any xhtml code that you could write in text, I don't
                            find any limitations. It's really just like an XML
                            tree but the various tags are defined as classes
                            themselves, that's all.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            For errors: you're right, and indeed I'm not
                            &quot;keeping&quot; the form data in the session,
                            just using the session as a temporary storage to
                            communicate it to the render request for
                            re-rendering the form (since they are separate
                            requests, different children might handle it). The
                            user does re-post all the data.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Oh, I think I get the misunderstanding, I think I
                            forgot to mention that I wrote my code so that
                            requests &quot;just render&quot; and &quot;just
                            handle&quot; are separate urls. i.e. /contact_edit
                            renders the form, /contact_edit_hndl handlers the
                            submit data, and then either redirects back to
                            /contact_edit or to some other page (in case of
                            success). I was debating for a while whether this
                            was a good approach (my background is in desktop
                            apps) and I pretty much like the separation. I don't
                            like for the requests that &quot;just render&quot;
                            to check and &quot;maybe&quot; handle the submit
                            data.

                    I love FormEncode--it's be best concept of a form validation
                    tookit I've ever seen. However, in all of the tutorials and
                    examples I've seen the actual form markup is maintained as a
                    string that is not part of the page template (it gets
                    inserted into the template later). I don't like that. I want
                    to have all my form markup reside in the template (I'm using
                    SimpleTAL), and process the template with htmlfill after the
                    template is expanded. I realize that there may be a
                    limitation of one form per page (or at least every input tag
                    must be uniquely named on each page).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Comment: htmlfill must happen after the template is expanded
                    because sometimes input tags are generated by the templating
                    system. If htmlfill happened first these tags would not
                    exist.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Bottom line: I'm running into problems with SimpleTAL
                    stripping the markup out of my &lt;form:error
                    name=&quot;fieldName&quot; /&gt; tags--after SimpleTAL
                    expansion they look like this: &lt;form&gt;. That won't do.
                    Is there a workaround or planned solution to this problem?

                        OK. I found the solution. Duh ... declare
                        &quot;form&quot; as an XML namespace. Like this:
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        &lt;html xmlns=&quot;<a
                            class="reference"
                            href="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"
                            >http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml</a
                        >&quot;
                        xmlns:form=&quot;http://www.formencode.org&quot;&gt;
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        That's all it took. Thanks for providing a space for me
                        to think out loud Ian.
