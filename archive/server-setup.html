        <h1>Server Setup</h1>
        <p>
            This is a not-very-interesting log of my recent server configuration
            efforts. Maybe interesting to people thinking of setting up a server
            (virtual servers are dirt cheap these days). It's not as easy as it
            could be, but it's getting easier.
        </p>

        <p>
            After putting it off for too long, I finally finished setting up a
            new server for my use. It's a bit than what I'm currently using, a
            VPS through <a href="http://pdxcolo.net">pdxcolo.net</a>. I chose
            them because their disk space was relatively cheap. They seem fine
            so far; like many companies run by techies, they are bad at billing.
            But that just means I pay late when they send invoices late, and
            that doesn't really hurt me. Like a good techie hosting provider,
            they also provide Debian, which was a prerequesite for me. Their
            setup tools are decent; filesystem configuration confused me for a
            bit, but I figured it out with a little help. The support was
            prompt.
        </p>

        <p>
            So, I thought I'd describe what I set up, and my thoughts on
            software. I tried out <a href="http://webmin.com">Webmin</a>, which
            I had never tried before. It was fairly easy to set up, and fairly
            unintrusive, but it doesn't do a ton that I can't do for myself.
            Webmin's complement,
            <a href="http://www.webmin.com/uintro.html">Usermin</a>, is more
            useful, as it lets the (small) number of users on the system do
            stuff through a web interface (change passwords, upload files, etc).
            I did a small amount of
            <a href="http://www.proftpd.org/">proftpd</a> configuration with
            Webmin, which worked well (proftpd seems to be better supported by
            Webmin than <a href="http://www.wu-ftpd.org/">wu-ftpd</a>).
        </p>

        <p>
            I've always found mail setup to be a pain in the butt. On one of my
            first systems, I used <a href="http://qmail.org">qmail</a>, in part
            because <a href="http://vmailmgr.org/">VMailMgr</a> looked cool. But
            that's when I was thinking of doing regular hosting, which didn't
            end up making sense.
        </p>

        <p>
            Anyway, qmail sucked. It's a real shame, there definitely some cool
            parts of qmail, especially the email namespaces. With qmail, any
            user can append <tt>-something</tt> to their username, and it gets
            delivered to their mailbox. In turn, they can set up handlers, so a
            user could set up a mailing list manager (e.g,
            <a href="http://www.ezmlm.org/">ezmlm</a>) without any administrator
            help (or interference). But it sucks for some other reasons. There's
            bizarre things, like configuration done through the
            <i>presence</i> of files -- the contents don't mean anything, merely
            that the file exists. In general the configuration was horrible, a
            mess of little files all around, with no decent error messages.
            Everything is recipes. Recipes suck, and are a sign of poor
            software. Qmail also uses all these abstractions and conventions
            that might make sense in some alternate qmail world, but they aren't
            Unix conventions. Like configuration went in <tt>/var</tt>. But
            Maildirs are cool (no <tt>&gt;From</tt>!).
        </p>

        <p>
            Qmail is likely stuck in this sucky situation for all eternity
            because its licensing sucks. It's a good example to bring out to
            show that anything short of Open Source isn't good enough. It's
            <i>so close</i> to open source, but people can't really package up
            the results of their modifications, and no real community can form
            around the packages to develop them further. (At least, this is my
            impression, baseless and from way outside the community.) And the
            author doesn't do anything with qmail anymore, so evolution won't
            come from that direction. (I wasted enough hours on qmail to feel a
            bit bitter.)
        </p>

        <p>
            So the second time around I thought I'd try
            <a href="http://www.postfix.org/">Postfix</a>. Postfix's major claim
            to fame is Just As Secure As Qmail, But Without The License. And
            it's not as weird. Postfix's documentation isn't that hot, and it's
            still confusing to someone who isn't a mail administrator, just a
            dabbler. I eventually got it working, but I never knew why. A lot of
            aspects seemed too manual, or they were confusing. The documentation
            was poor.
        </p>

        <p>
            Honestly, security doesn't excite me. Maybe it's because I figure if
            I'm using a fairly major piece of software and keeping up to date
            (easy on Debian!) then I'll be okay. It's worked for me so far
            (knock on wood). Or if I'm using obscure software, even that's
            obscure in its own way. Sendmail has its problems, but security
            seems like its only one of many. People have become reactionary. So
            now I'm back to trusty <a href="http://www.exim.org/">Exim</a>. It's
            well supported on Debian, the configuration basically makes sense
            (kind of). It has really good documentation. I've also simplified my
            setup, so that an address at any domain goes to the same user; my
            usernames have to be unique across domains, but that's okay. Virtual
            domains look reasonably easy in Exim, so if I ever need them they
            are there. The only real problem I had with Exim was with Mailman
            integration, which Mailman's README.Debian would have explained if I
            had read it.
        </p>

        <p>
            To finish off mail, I used
            <a href="http://dovecot.org/">Dovecot</a> for IMAP, since
            <a href="http://www.washington.edu/imap/">uw-imapd</a> (which I had
            used before) didn't accept logins. Very annoying; I saw some similar
            problems on some Debian mailing lists, but no resolutions. I think
            it may have been some stupid SSL security restriction. Stupid
            security.
            <a href="http://www.squirrelmail.org/">Squirrelmail</a> and
            <a href="http://www.list.org/">Mailman</a> installed easily.
        </p>

        <p>
            The only thing left was Apache. I decided to go with Apache 2, as
            I've been
            <a
                href="http://blog.colorstudy.com/ianb/weblog/2004/08/12.html#P147"
                >intrigued</a
            >
            with some of the new features, even if they seem minor. Apache 2 (at
            least on Debian) has a new config file setup, which I quite like.
            <tt>apache2.conf</tt> has a bunch of standard options that are
            boring and don't generally need to be customized.
            <tt>ports.conf</tt> defines the IP addresses and ports, while
            <tt>httpd.conf</tt> is for the other global options.
            <tt>mods-available/</tt> has a file for each module; you symlink
            those files to <tt>mods-enabled/</tt> to install them. Virtual hosts
            go in <tt>sites-available/</tt>, with symlinks to
            <tt>sites-enabled/</tt>. It's all very transparent and easy to
            understand, while being more structured than the big-pile-of-config
            of a single <tt>httpd.conf</tt>. Debian's Apache 1.3 has some weird
            files for module configuration that I don't like at all, in part
            because I never got
            <a href="http://wiki.webwareforpython.org/modwebkit.html"
                >mod_webkit</a
            >
            working with it properly. Apache 2 was easy.
        </p>

        <p>
            The other thing I used was
            <a href="http://www.coelho.net/mod_macro/">mod_macro</a>, which
            allowed me to set up some common locations and settings for all my
            virtual hosts, with some slight modifications on a per-domain basis.
            I actually would have preferred
            <a href="http://www.thebearbyte.com/manual/mod/mod_define.html"
                >mod_define</a
            >, but it doesn't seem to be available for Apache 2. I think
            mod_define plus Includes are basically equivalent to mod_macro, but
            easier to understand (since definitions are named, but macro
            arguments are positional).
        </p>

        <p>
            I also installed lots of Python things, some databases, all the
            utilities, Webware, mod_webkit2, and other stuff, but those were all
            easy. Debian is great.

            Ah, I did the "usernames must be unique across virtual hosts" thing.
            It's a bit problematic for webmaster@, because it means the owner of
            the "primary" domain (whichever one Exim knows abot first, I think)
            gets all those mails. It's not a major problem, and I did manage to
            fix it, but I can't remember how. My policy on altering Exim is:
            <br />
            1. avoid doing it
            <br />
            2. see step 1
            <br />
            3. poke things randomly, fearful of losing mail, until it works or
            you give up and revert to what it was before
            <br />
            Not the best policy, but what can I say :)

            Exim has a fantastic configuration, making complex custom situations
            possible without confusing the simple stuff. I've twiddled mine to
            do AV, SpamAssassin, virtual domains with alias domains, Maildirs,
            etc. Drop me a line if you run into any questions.

            Regarding mailing list managers, there's one that's aimed to be
            sort-of-an ezmlm clone, Enemies of Carlotta [1]. It has more liberal
            license and is a bit simpler. (It's written in Python, but that
            shouldn't make much of a difference to the decision, I guess.)

            Just wondering why you passed up getting a Linode www.linode.com
            <br />

            <br />
            Very professional. More disk space per $. More distros to choose
            from including Debian. I've been using them for over a year. I just
            don't see that pdxcolo has any advantages.

            I seem to remember when I was looking that linode wasn't taking any
            clients for their VPS plan -- all their servers must have been fully
            committed. PDXColo also has cheaper disk space -- $1/GB/mo, vs.
            $5/GB/mo. This is nice, since I am keeping all my mail on the
            server; instead of upgrading to a more expensive plan, I can just
            add on the particular resource I want. And of course, I don't care
            about the distribution selection, as long as they have the one I
            want ;)

            I must agree about Qmail, 'though I've been using it for 7 years.
            Postfix seems like the right way to go and may do that some time in
            future (along with switching to
