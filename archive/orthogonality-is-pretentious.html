                >
                is a much-touted philosophy of language and system design. To
                boil it down: orthogonal design means that features multiply
                each other's utility, and overlap as little as possible. Given a
                set of carefully-crafted orthogonal features, you can enable a
                wide variety of possibilities through combining those features.
                In theory, this means that you can have a small and simple
                &quot;core&quot;, which enables a rich environment. Languages at
                far end in this direction of design would be Smalltalk and
                Scheme.
            </p>
            <p>
                This seems really nice, and everything seems comprehensible and
                simple. Except, if you actually work with Scheme code that does
                something useful, it's not particularly simple. In Smalltalk it
                is very common to encounter
                <a class="reference" href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?RavioliCode"
                    >Ravioli Code</a
                >, a kind of anti-spaghetti code that seems to be nearly as
                incomprehensible. Idealists of this direction of design end up
                with weird concepts like
                <a
                    class="reference"
                    href="http://www.paulgraham.com/hundred.html"
                    >Paul Graham's 100 Year Language</a
                >
                where he speculates on designing a language without built-in
                integers, because integers can be derived from simpler concepts.
                Only a mathematician would call that elegant, of course -- but
                even they are lying when they say that, for even the most
                fundamentalist mathematician does not use the
                <a
                    class="reference"
                    href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda_calculus"
                    >Lambda Calculus</a
                >
                when balancing their checkbook.
            </p>
            <p>
                Orthogonal design allows unbound creativity. Anyone who tries to
                be creative knows that creativity without bounds is very hard to
                handle.
                <a

                >
                is still worse, but constraints aren't <em>all</em> bad.
            </p>
            <p>
                So, on the opposite side of the spectrum from the orthgonal
                languages are languages with non-multiplicative features --
                features that are mutually exclusive, or linearly enumerable.
                Here lies PHP (which I started thinking about from
                <a
                    class="reference"
                    href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2006/02/17/PHP"
                    >this discussion</a
                >).
            </p>
            <p>
                And there are real benefits to that position! One example of
                this design in PHP is the lack of objects in the standard
                library. Instead it is one very long list of functions. If you
                want to do something with the standard library there either
                <em>is</em> a function for doing it, or there <em>is not</em> a
                function. If you want to see what you can do, you can just scan
                through the index.
            </p>
            <p>
                This is literally what beginning programmers do (and mediocre
                experienced programmers). They read lists, and this is very
                productive for them. I'm not a beginner, but I still like lists
                too. You find what you want, or you don't; and if you do, you
                probably find an example close to what you want to do. Or you
                don't, and then you have to think and be creative, but for some
                software you don't really want to be creative, you just want to
                <em>get shit done</em>. PHP is all about getting your shit done.
                You go beyond that and PHP is not that satisfying. But man, when
                you are coding PHP you can practically fall asleep and your
                fingers will still be flying, banging out code -- it feels
                <em>so</em> productive. If you are a fast typist and you have a
                loud keyboard this is a very good way to impress your coworkers.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you feel code is a liability you will not be so impressed by
                the large number of characters produced by a PHP programmer. Oh
                well. Because the PHP programmer -- particularly the beginner,
                but this can even apply to the advanced programmer -- feels very
                satisfied, there's lots of positive feedback. They are not using
                the values of pretentious <em>software engineers</em>.
            </p>
            <p>
                So, that's why PHP is so popular. And it's entirely deserved.
                And Basic before it -- another language that seems so painful
                because of the lack of orthogonality, but that is both its curse
                and greatest feature.
            </p>
            <p>
                The language that got me thinking along these lines wasn't
                actually PHP, but
                <a
                    class="reference"
                    href="http://www.djangoproject.com/documentation/templates/"
                    >Django templates</a
                >. I was looking at them, and they have no expressions, no
                boolean operators, nothing complex, nothing you can't process
                with a regular expression. And as a result if you look at the
                documentation you see an enumeration of
                <em>everything you can do</em>. <strong>Everything</strong>.
                That feels uncomfortably constraining to me. But to someone who
                doesn't program that would feel very comforting. And that's the
                whole point of that language; it wasn't written for me. And I
                guess PHP wasn't written for me either, but I already knew that
                anyway.

                    Niggle: Django lets you write custom tags and filters in
                    Python to extend the template language. I like your angle on
                    it a lot though. Having all of the functionality laid bare
                    before you (we've always deliberately tried to avoid letting
                    the template language become another programming language)
                    has a definite advantage both in dealing with non-programmer
                    designers and in encouraging application logic to stay out
                    of the templates.

                        but it is not the template programmer who is extending
                        anything. Custom tags seem more like a localized or
                        app/site/domain-specific set of constructs, and then you
                        have the main Django tag list and the local tag list,
                        but they are still lists.

                    +1. Without lists most things feel like you've got tunnel

                    Combined with the built-in tag/filter/model/view
                    documentation in the Django admin, this really is an
                    enormous timesaver for handing off finished apps to clients
                    or non-programmers (like me). When we add a new tag or
                    object to a client app, all I have to do is send the client
                    developers a link to the docs and they know exactly what
                    they need to add to the templates. And the best part is, our
                    programmers move on to doing something else productive
                    instead of lingering in the muck of helping the client (or
                    me) make it &quot;look right&quot; in the template.

                    When you're a solo programmer I can see how it would be
                    great to have total control and flexibility of a real
                    programming language in the templates. But when you're
                    handing off to someone who's not a programmer it's a killer
                    feature to be able to control what they can and can't do
                    without having to explain it to them. Just implement,

                        If you ever try a templating language that is Pythonic
                        and try mixing up with CSS/HTML you are in for big
                        trouble, as and when the designers do those little
                        adjustments, the damn Python indentation gets screwed
                        up. It can be a pain fixing them up

                    I think you've got one reason why Smalltalk bothers me.
                    Orthogonal sounds good in practice (and does have some real
                    value), but most people (outside maybe mathematicians) don't
                    think that way.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For example, all human languages that I know of are
                    decidedly non-regular and non-orthogonal. Made up ones
                    (Esperanto) haven't been a success. Or, nearer to Computer
                    Science, early RISC processors emphasized orthogonality
                    (which does have value for pipelining and compiler writers),
                    but all the surviving ones (PowerPC, ARM, etc) have bulked
                    up considerably.

                    Programming isn't assembling lego! You can over-do anything
                    I guess, but I would rather learn how to mix and match five
                    orthogonal functions than work out what 5**5 = 3125 separate
                    functions do.

                    With an orthogonal design, your solution space is regularly
                    structured into n dimensions. Makes live really easy if you
                    have a huge problem space to match it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    But beginners have a rather small problem space, and for the
                    even smaller number of solutions they need to tackle it,
                    being forced to think in multiple dimensions is just
                    overkill, apart from the fact that most of us humans prefer
                    not to be bothered with too many dimensions anyway, so the
                    flat list (n=1) can hardly be beaten in terms of popularity.

                    Orthogonality is not just (rightfully) pretentious. It's
                    also complex in itself and difficult to do right. Although
                    mathematical analogies appear to be tempting, there is a
                    huge difference between mathematical and programming spaces
                    - programs do not live in a single space and so there are no
                    15 universal axes along which you should be able to modify
                    your program. I would rather compare a program to a bunch of
                    pipes connected with junctions. At each junction
                    orthogonality helps to rotate the pipes in any direction you
                    like, but as soon as we live in three dimensional space,
                    there is hardly any use of more than two axes
                    _at_each_junction_.
