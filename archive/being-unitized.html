                    >I don't like unittest that much</a
                >.
            </p>
            <p>
                But the article turns into a curmudgeonly rant and his
                underlying resentment of unit testing comes out:
            </p>
            <blockquote>
                <p>Consider the goals and tenents of unit testing:</p>
                <ul class="simple">
                    <li>Very small &quot;units&quot; are tested</li>
                    <li>
                        Testing is almost always done of individual components
                        in isolation from other components
                    </li>
                    <li>Mocking strengthens the isolation aspect</li>
                    <li>
                        The code and the tests are almost always written by the
                        same person
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Taken together this means that unit tests are testing the
                    lowest level pieces of your code, each in turn and in
                    isolation from all other pieces, and the definition of the
                    tests and the code are done by the same person.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This sort of testing catches what I consider &quot;low
                    hanging fruit&quot;. It catches problems-in-the-small. It'll
                    find individual methods or classes which don't match what
                    the unit tests say should happen.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This is a good thing and provides very valuable feedback on
                    the correctness of your code. But keep in mind it _only_
                    catches low hanging fruit. By design, unit testing is
                    supposed to be easy, and to consider individual small pieces
                    of a system in isolation. Because of this, by its very
                    nature, unit testing does not consider the _composition_ of
                    a system, only its individual parts. Unit tests never check
                    the interconnections of an application, it never checks how
                    they are wired together.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In my experience, the interconnections and
                    &quot;wiring&quot; of an app is where most of the complexity
                    of the application lies. The wiring defines your design, and
                    if considered at a high enough level it can even be
                    considered to capture your architecture. How information
                    flows across many software layers and between many
                    components really define what an application does. And the
                    very definition of Unit Testing is that it does not test
                    these aspects of an application. Unit testing ignores
                    information flow across software layers and components,
                    ignores how classes and objects are interrelated and are put
                    together into larger designs and architecture. This means
                    that unit tests can catch simple errors in individual pieces
                    of code, but says nothing whatsoever about your system's
                    design or architecture. And what makes or breaks an
                    application really is the overall design and architecture.
                    The design and architecture captures your system's
                    performance, it's memory use, the &quot;end-to-end&quot;
                    correctness from the user's inputs out to whatever servers
                    you might be using, and the round trip back again. How all
                    the wiring interconnects shows the true system behavior, and
                    it is in this area where the toughest bugs and problems lie,
                    and where people sweat blood to get things right. Writing
                    individual components in isolation is easy. It's hooking
                    them together into a cohesive whole that's hard - and unit
                    tests only pass judgement on the individual parts in
                    isolation, not the whole.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Getting one component to act &quot;correctly&quot; in a
                    system is almost always a pretty trivial exercise. Writing
                    one component in isolation is not the difficult part of
                    computer programming. Any single small component of a system
                    is generally easy to code. The hard part of development
                    comes in getting all of the components of a system to work
                    together - to get the wiring right. Unit tests can verify
                    that each of your individual components does what you the
                    developer thinks it should do. But by its very definition,
                    unit testing cannot check the more complex
                    &quot;wiring&quot; - and the wiring is where most of our
                    design, development, and debugging time goes into.

                There's also some weird digs at
                <a class="reference" href="http://www.martinfowler.com/"
                    >Martin Fowler</a

                (and I guess all consultants), which seems out of the blue and a
                little mean. The guy has a chip on his shoulder. But anyway,
                I'll respond with my thinking on unit tests.
            </p>
            <p>
                First:
                <em
                    >Getting one component to act &quot;correctly&quot; in a
                    system is almost always a pretty trivial exercise.</em
                >
                Sure, getting it to act &quot;correctly&quot; is easy. Getting a
                component to act correctly <em>without</em>
                <a
                    class="reference"
                    href="http://www.informatics.susx.ac.uk/doc/punctuation/node31.html"
                    >scare quotes</a
                >
                is much harder. If your component acts correctly all that wiring
                will work correctly too (by definition). When he's talking about
                &quot;correctly&quot; I think he really means &quot;according to
                some spec that was delivered to the programmer.&quot; This is a
                symptom of defensive programming, where the programmer isn't at
                fault if there's a bug in the spec, or a bug in the larger
                design, or what-have-you. A responsible programmer cares about
                the success of the larger project, and judges correctness based
                on the utility and reliability of their code in that larger
                project, so there is no &quot;correct&quot; that does not
                include the system.
            </p>
            <p>
                But another error is in how he views &quot;units&quot;. A unit
                test is small and isolated, and tests a small amount of code.
                But a &quot;small amount of code&quot; is a matter of
                perspective. I shudder to think about the amount of code
                involved in the Python expression
                <tt class="docutils literal"
                    ><span class="pre">a</span> <span class="pre">=</span>
                    <span class="pre">some_dict.copy()</span></tt
                >. There's the Python compiler, and VM, and the dictionary
                implementation, and the code behind classes and types, and
                underneath that is libc and the kernel and who knows what. And
                the combinations! Most of those pieces have multiple
                implementations; alternate dictionary-like objects, alternate
                VMs, many underlying platforms. We have created ourselves a
                Tower of Babel, an incredible monument to abstraction. But God
                hasn't struck us down... well, we have been &quot;cursed&quot;
                with a multitude of languages, but our efforts have not
                collapsed.
            </p>
            <p>
                And yet despite all that underlying code, that one line is
                <em>too small</em> to be unit tested. So how did we get there?
                For the purpose of what we're testing we ignore the code and
                trust the abstractions. All those pieces underneath it are
                mature and well tested, having undergone years of development
                and testing by a large number of developers.
            </p>
            <p>
                When I create a system, I have to build those same kinds of
                abstractions, reliable pieces that I can trust. When I later
                create code that depends on those libraries, I test that code, I
                do not test the library.
            </p>
            <p>
                But unlike foundational code like libc, I can't put years of
                effort into building my abstractions. I have deadlines, and
                anyway I don't actually <em>want</em> to work on a single
                project for years at a time, all the way through to some
                time-based maturity, suffering through an unreliable interim and
                using QA departments and other systems that require bureaucracy.
            </p>
            <p>
                Unit testing is in this way circular. Unit testing allows me to
                bring something to maturity faster, to practically
                <em>will it</em> to maturity. Along the way I have to make
                compromises -- I have to keep my code decoupled, and I have to
                write for testability. But I make those compromises because they
                allow me to move <em>beyond</em> my code, to build up things
                that don't need to be constantly revisited and retested
                according to context.
            </p>
            <p>
                This is circular, because only with this foundation can I move
                to testing higher-level code in &quot;isolation&quot;. Because
                of the
                <a
                    class="reference"

                    >Stable Dependencies Principle</a
                >, I can't build something reliable and mature on top of
                something that is unreliable and immature. I can only make my
                code &quot;isolated&quot; if I have real trust that my
                underlying code is well defined and functional, that I can
                ignore it the way I ignore libc and the virtual machine. And I
                can only do that with unit tests.

                    I agree with most of what you have to say - I think most
                    people who use unit-tests realize that you can't use them
                    instead of having a well-understood QA process. Also, it's
                    my understanding that unit tests are quite good at prevents

                    I suspect a lot of people shudder when they hear the idea of
                    programmers writing tests. But one of the benefits
                    <em>has</em> to be that as a programmer, you really have to
                    think about what you're doing before you do it. What is this
                    one thing supposed to do. Before unit testing was popular,
                    we required our developers to write function 'tombstones'
                    (documentation about the name, who wrote it when, what it
                    does, valid results, etc. etc.) before writing the code so
                    that one would consider the atomic parts necessary. It
                    helped.

                    ill agree that Spille shoots himself in the foot by ranting
                    heavily and slathering on the quasi-ad-hominem stuff, but I
                    like the points he makes at the end for integration tests,
                    regression tests, and non-functional tests. I think we dont
                    hear so much about those things on the one hand because they
                    are so &quot;old school&quot; and we supposedly all know
                    them already, but I think moreso because
                    <em>those techniques are hard</em> and cant be easily
                    transmitted into one-page soundbyte-types of articles and
                    tutorials. and the rule of the day seems to be the
                    technologies and techniques that can be learned by any
                    newbie in half a day are the only ones that gain any kind of

                    the testing style i am familiar with on pretty much an
                    intuitive basis, is a couple of unit tests just for highly
                    algorithmic units of code, such as elaborate data structures
                    or synchronization objects, and after that a lot of
                    integration testing, functional testing, and regression
                    testing, with a varied mix of automated test runners and
                    manual tests, as is appropriate. so far, ive never felt so
                    inclined to write unit tests for all those components that
                    are obviously trivial (trivial to me, that is), which pretty
                    much prove their functionality after i inspect their
                    progress within some full-system tests (i.e. components
                    where if they had any kind of flaw, theres no way the app
                    could possibly work).

                <p>
                    But, I am trying to &quot;see the light&quot; for a more
                    unit-testing-fundamental approach and beginning to
                    semi-begrudgingly write some unit tests for code i usually
                    wouldnt bother with, and in fact it did reveal some dumb
                    little non-bug-but-not-quite-correct behavior almost right
                    out of the gate. But I'm also inclined to throw into the
                    testing framework a combination of unit tests and the more
                    integrative tests Ive already written, like multithreaded
                    load-killer type tests and other front-to-back types of
                    stuff. Since unittest, being minimal (and yes not that great
                    i agree) just gives you &quot;testXXXX&quot;, why even call
                    it &quot;unittest&quot; ? you can put whatever kinds of
                    tests you want in there.

                    I had this impression.. let me state it: this is a java guy.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I don't mean he is using java I mean he is committed to the
                    idea that if a thing is simple it is not valuable. The
                    problem with unittest in python is a different beast, people
                    actually want it to be more simple. Go figure.
                </p>
                <p>
                    On the second part of the article, the one you quote, I
                    wonder: what the hell he's trying to say? If I can't unit
                    test the composition of components, how am I supposed to
                    check if something work? Should I automate my tests by
                    getting some slave who endlessly type the same input or
                    should I use some kind of automated interface..mh.. like..
                    well.. a xUnit framework?
                </p>
                <p>
                    Also, he clearly states that unit testing &quot;says nothing
                    whatsoever about your system's design or architecture&quot;,
                    which imo is wrong. The ease of testing is a direct heir of
                    good design.
