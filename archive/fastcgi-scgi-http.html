</div><h1>FastCGI SCGI HTTP</h1>
 
<div class="document">
<p><a class="reference" href="http://www.vmunix.com/mark/blog/archives/2006/01/02/fastcgi-scgi-and-apache-background-and-future">Mark Mayo</a>
has a useful post on FastCGI and SCGI, a kind of an overview of the
history.  At the end, he comes out preferring HTTP with proxying.
I'll throw in my two cents...</p>
<p>Proxying HTTP seems elegant, but I don't think it is any more elegant
than FastCGI or SCGI.  In reality they are almost the same; you don't
lose any information mapping from HTTP to FastCGI or SCGI, and you
abstract away a few things that are nice to get rid of.  But only a
very small number.</p>
<p>One thing that is brought up is the quality of the HTTP
implementations.  I don't think this is a big deal -- if I understand
correctly, a proxied HTTP connection will be cleaned up, and you don't
have to worry about the kinds of corner cases that a public production
web server needs to worry about.  Connections don't die that often,
there's some sanity in headers, etc.  Putting SimpleHTTPServer or
WEBrick behind Apache is probably just fine.</p>
<p>What FastCGI and SCGI provide that HTTP doesn't is a clear separation
of the original request and the delegated request.  <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">REMOTE_ADDR</span></tt> is
the IP address of <em>original</em> request, not the frontend server, and
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">HTTP_HOST</span></tt> is also the original host.  <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">SCRIPT_NAME</span></tt> and
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">PATH_INFO</span></tt> are separated out, giving you some idea of context.</p>
<p>These are small issues, but they are important.  Without this, you
have to do double configuration on both sides of the connection, and
passing through information through ad hoc techniques like headers you
make up (<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">X-Forwarded-For</span></tt> being a common example).</p>
<p>Which leads to the second issue... what can you trust?  Can you trust
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">X-Forwarded-For</span></tt>?  Maybe.  Can you trust 127.0.0.1?  Probably; are
you sure you remembered to set that up?</p>
<p>With the *CGIs you get another internal channel of communication for
communicating trusted information.  A common example is
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">REMOTE_USER</span></tt>, the logged-in user.  You don't have to sign it or go
through hoops to be sure you can trust it.  If it's there, you know
that an upstream <em>internal</em> server added it.</p>
<p>These are small details, but I think they are useful enough to make
the *CGIs worth it compared to proxying.  They reduce configuration,
and I <em>hate</em> configuration, and they help avoid insecure and ad hoc
conventions for information sharing.  At the same time, all three are
very similar techniques, and you shouldn't read too much into the
decision.</p>
<p>FastCGI has some more features still, particularly process
management.  I wish I felt like I could confidently use such features,
they seem nice.  But I also don't think they need to be part of the
communication protocol; SCGI is a nice, simple protocol, and the
process management might be best implemented separately.  FastCGI's
heapin' pile o' features is probably its biggest flaw.</p>

<p>On the other hand, depending on where you put logic, with HTTP Proxy you can do your testing directly on your server, without Apache in the picture. The fact that it does go over the network also gives you some flexability about distributing your application.</p>

<p>SCGI and FastCGI can go over the network.  But yes, HTTP is nice for testing.  And so with WSGI you needn't choose one over the other ;)</p>

<p>For me, the biggest boon to &quot;not PHP web frameworks&quot; has been FastCGI.  Finally I can run fancy web frameworks on my $10 / month Dreamhost account rather than shelling out ~ $100 or more a month for a dedicated server, or $40 for a virtual dedicated server.  I'm all for giving up root in favor of ease of administration, low cost, and a feeling of &quot;let those dudes take care of it for me.&quot;</p>
<p>FastCGI is the big equalizer.  As long as your FoC (Framework of Choice) supports FastCGI, you're good to go (sort of).  It's very exciting to the cheapskate (me) web developer / hobbiests of the world who just want to blog about wine, their cats, or maybe bees.</p>

<p>Check that again. RapidVPS: $10. TekTonic VPS: $15.</p>

<p>I'm not. I'm for control and versatility. Hands off my root! ;-P</p>
