        <div class="document">
            <p>
                Lots of releases this weekend. I'm tired of them, but glad to
                get them off my back.
            </p>
            <p>
                So I released: SQLObject 0.7, Paste 0.3, Paste Script 0.3, Paste
                Deploy 0.3, Paste WebKit 0.3, and Wareweb 0.1. I'd link them,
                but I'm tired of linking. See
                <a class="reference" href="http://sqlobject.org"
                    >http://sqlobject.org</a
                >
                and
                <a class="reference" href="http://pythonpaste.org"
                    >http://pythonpaste.org</a
                >.
            </p>
            <p>
                I redesigned all the sites while I was at it, using
                <a class="reference" href="http://pudge.lesscode.org">Pudge</a>.
                It works pretty well, you can just throw it at a package and it
                comes up with something passable, and you can tweak from there.
                I made a little contribution to Kid while I was at it, to
                generate non-HTML/XHTML. I feel like I'm all over the place with
                my development now -- I've been using Cheetah in Paste (Script)
                lately, ZPT at work an in my web apps, and now Kid for this
                stuff. And that's just one piece, I'm finding myself touching a
                wide set of projects now. But it's okay.
            </p>
            <p>
                I'm looking forward to spending less time Maintaining, and more
                time Developing. But I still have lots of docs to write, lots of
                stuff to clean up. My toolset is improving, but it's still
                tiring. SQLObject 0.7 was a big hump to get over; I'm sure an
                0.7.1 version will come out before too long, but it's in pretty
                good shape all considered. Lots of new features, but it's been
                so long since I've used 0.6.1 that I can't hardly remember what
                they are. I've had some plans for changing the way the
                metaclasses and magic attributes (columns and joins) work for a
                while, and I'm kind of excited about actually trying them out
                now -- I didn't want to do it before 0.7, because it's a big
                refactoring.
            </p>
            <p>
                But it's good... people are using a lot of these packages, and
                that's cool.
                <a class="reference" href="http://formencode.org">FormEncode</a>
                lingered for a long time, but with Subway, TurboGears, and
                another Myghty project using it, I'm glad to see it coming back
                again. SQLObject has been doing well too; 270 people on the
                mailing list, and again lots of projects... really FormEncode
                has ridden on SQLObject's coat tails, since it's all the same
                projects. But there's also lots of apps out there using
                SQLObject, and a lot of people who seem to use it with no
                trouble, so I don't hear much from them. Which is good too.
            </p>
            <p>
                Paste is still the big challenge for me. If anything its users
                have dwindled, and the development has been confused, and I know
                it's been confusing for people from the outside. But now that
                I'm using Eggs for the infrastructure it all feels much more
                defined to me. Now, if people can just understand what it is, I
                think it'd do okay. It doesn't have any competitors, except for
                some ad hoc tools built into various frameworks, which are
                typically there simply because they have to be, not because
                anyone gives them any love. Deployment and development isn't the
                stuff that excites me the most either, but I wrote this stuff
                because the tools generally sucked (regardless of framework).
            </p>
            <p>
                Anyway... I just hope I don't get totally burned out before too
                long.

                    Great work man...thanks for all your hard work. Take care of
                    yourself though, don't get spread thin. Eat lots of fruits
                    and veggies. Make sure to drink water.

                    As someone who appreciates (greatly) SQLObject, I've come to
                    recognize your name -- and look for it on software! If
                    you're working on or looking at something, I can bet that
                    I'd better be looking at it too.
                </p>
                <p>Thanks for using your genius in such a great way!!</p>

                        I've never really used epydoc, though I have looked at
                        it. I'm not a fan of three-paned browsing, though I
                        vaguely remember hearing you can generate non-framed
                        pages from it too. In the end, I found Pudge more useful
                        for generating the rest of the sites -- just doing the
                        simple stuff of rendering the reST files, wrapping them
                        in a template, and (with buildutils) uploading them. But
                        now that the source is up there, I suspect I'll be
                        tweaking that part more as well.
