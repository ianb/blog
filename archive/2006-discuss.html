                    One of my favourite quotes from Ken Thompson (who apparently
                    knows a bit about computers) is:
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                    I tend to break up a subprogram when there are too many
                    local variables. Another clue is [too many] levels of
                    indentation. I rarely look at length.

                    It's not an absolute truth, but he does give two pretty good
                    indicators.

                <p>
                    The length of a function isn't important - what you're
                    trying to do in that length is... :-)
                </p>
                <p>
                    This kind of quote used to make me disappointed that I never
                    went to university to do computer science. I imagined that
                    such quotes would be thrown out by a teacher, followed by
                    the magic word &quot;Discuss&quot;.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Of course, I eventually met some CS students, who disabused
                    me of this romantic notion. ;-)

                Yeah, that would be a neat class, but I never had a class like
                that. It's not so much the teachers wouldn't be open to that,
                but that the students wouldn't be capable of following up with a
                discussion. It would be dumb anyway -- speculating on design
                practices that apply to something none of the students have ever
                done: working with code at different stages of the code life
                cycle. At best the students could rephrase other bits of wisdom
                heard but never experienced, which does not a discussion make.
                This describes a large portion of the discussions I had in
                college classes. Discussion sucked. But then I wasn't a very
                satisfied student in general.

                    Number of variables, lines or nested levels is just a sign
                    to take more careful look. Should code be changed or not it
                    depends on context. I can spot bad code from 5 meters, it's
                    much harder to tell if code is done right. Some things are
                    complex and require complex algorithms. On another side, if
                    piece of code does not fit in my screen, it probably will be
                    too complex to fit in my brain in first reads.

                    My experience is that only a small part in CS is about
                    programming.
