                I've updated the blogging software to support comments. I've
                also imported all the old comments from my last software (except
                some of the last comments that were lost during the transition).
                It imports from the atom created by the
                <a class="reference" href="my-new-blog.html">PyCS exporter</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                I'm glad to get all those posts back online, as there was a lot
                of good content there. Really the primary way I judge this blog
                is from the reactions and responses, so it was always very
                gratifying to me how intelligent and thoughtful the comments
                have been.
            </p>
            <p>
                Now you can write your comments using
                <a
                    class="reference"
                    href="http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html"
                    >restructured text</a
                >, so posting code snippets should be less painful. And there's
                even a WSYIWYG for people who want that (hit
                <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">change...</span></tt
                >).
            </p>
            <p>
                Putting this all in a Wiki is rather experimental, so we'll see
                how it goes. (I must admit I'm less than super confident about
                the code...)

                Seems like there's a little bug. When 'main blog page' refers 2
                comments on this post (excluding mine), i can count 3 posts for
                real. But 2 threads ;=) So what will you count, threads or
                comments ?
