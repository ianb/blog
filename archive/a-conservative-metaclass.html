        <h1>A Conservative Metaclass</h1>
        <p>
            I use metaclasses in several of the projects I've written. In just
            about all of the cases, the metaclasses have been very minimal (or
            at least would be if I was clear ahead of time what I was doing),
            but all metaclasses have an air of mystery about them.
        </p>

        <p>
            The metaclasses I've used have been primarily to support a sort of
            declarative style of programming. For instance, consider a
            <a href="http://svn.colorstudy.com/trunk/Validator">validation</a>
            schema:
        </p>

        <pre>
class Registration(schema.Schema):
    first_name = validators.String(notEmpty=True)
    last_name = validators.String(notEmpty=True)
    mi = validators.MaxLength(1)
    class Numbers(foreach.ForEach):
        class Number(schema.Schema):
            type = validators.OneOf(['home', 'work'])
            phone_number = validators.PhoneNumber()
</pre
        >

        Hopefully you can imagine what that schema means from the class
        statement, even if you wouldn't know exactly how to use it. In another
        system this might look like:

        <pre>
registration = schema.Schema()
registration.add_field(
    'first_name', validators.String(not_empty=True))
...
</pre
        >

        <a href="http://python.org/doc/current/lib/module-optparse.html"
            >optparse</a
        >
        is an example of this style.

        <p>
            Anyway, while metaclasses are useful here, their use is very
            minimal. This is a metaclass you could use for something like this:
        </p>

        <pre>
class DeclarativeMeta(type):
    def __new__(meta, class_name, bases, new_attrs):
        cls = type.__new__(meta, class_name, bases, new_attrs)
        cls.__classinit__.im_func(cls, new_attrs)
        return cls
class Declarative(object):
    __metaclass__ = DeclarativeMeta
    def __classinit__(cls, new_attrs): pass
</pre
        >

        The basic idea is just to run a function (<code>__classinit__</code>) on
        the class when the class is created. For something like the schema, I
        then go through the new attributes and see if any of them are "magic",
        like:

        <pre>
class Schema(Declarative):
    fields = {}
    def __classinit__(cls, new_attrs):
        cls.fields = cls.fields.copy()
        for name, value in new_attrs.items():
            if isinstance(value, validators.ValidatorBaseClass):
                cls.add_field(name, value)

    @classmethod
    def add_field(cls, name, field):
        cls.fields[name] = field
        field.name = name
</pre
        >

        <p>
            Basically I'm just indexing and naming the attributes in this case,
            which is actually all I'm likely to need to do. Also note that
            <code>add_field</code> allows me to continue to modify the class at
            runtime, which allows for all sorts of metaprogramming down the
            road. In <a href="http://sqlobject.org">SQLObject</a> I use this
            when determining columns from the database, then adding the column
            objects using this class method.
        </p>

        <p>
            The end result is something that I find aesthetically pleasing to
            use, and avoids a lot of boilerplate. At the same time, I think it's
            fairly easy to understand, without getting caught up in the
            mysterious aspects of metaclasses.
        </p>
