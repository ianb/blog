                    >via</a
                >). This is great; when I was building an importer for this blog
                (from another blog software where I wrote the export by
                accessing the database directly) I used Atom, but had to invent
                something to match comments up to their respective posts.
                Relating comments to their posts was the only place where there
                seemed to be information loss in dumping the entire blog to
                Atom. So I made
            </p>
            <p>So, the extension seems to look like this:</p>
            <pre class="literal-block">
&lt;feed xmlns:thr=&quot;http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0&quot;&gt;
  &lt;entry&gt;
    &lt;thr:in-reply-to ref=&quot;post-id&quot; /&gt;
    ....
  &lt;/entry&gt;
&lt;/feed&gt;
</pre
            >
            <p>
                With this I think most blogs can be 100% represented by an Atom
                model.
            </p>
            <p>
                Well... another problem is that many blogs use something other
                than HTML for their content; something like Restructured Text,
                Textile, Markdown, etc. To be an accurate representation, the
                <tt class="docutils literal"
                    ><span class="pre">&lt;content&gt;</span></tt
                >
                should contain that format, or multiple forms of the content
                should be presented, with one marked as editable. Maybe the
                simplest solution to this is to store only the canonical
                representation (as, say,
                <tt class="docutils literal"
                    ><span class="pre">text/x-restructured-text</span></tt
                >) and render the feed differently for actual readers. But it
                would be nicer if this wasn't necessary.
            </p>
            <p>
                There's also an extension in that spec for giving the comment
                feed URL:
            </p>
            <pre class="literal-block">
&lt;link rel=&quot;replies&quot; href=&quot;comment-feed.xml&quot; /&gt;
</pre
            >
            <p>
                This doesn't really do anything for blog publishing software,
                just for readers, but it could be nice; having per-entry comment
                feeds isn't very interesting right now because the subscription
                process is not well automated -- the typical blog subscription
                process is way too heavy when you are just curious about
                followup comments that might last for a week at most. This gives
                smart readers an opportunity to treat this case specially.

                A while ago there was some talk on the Pylons list about blog
                publishing software, and I brainstormed a kind of
                <a
                    class="reference"
                    href="http://webwareforpython.org/archives/message/20060621.051852.7622e3bf.en.html"
                    >distributed set of pieces</a
                >
                to implement a blog. The
                <a
                    class="reference"
                    href="http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-atompub-protocol-09.txt"

                >
                and an Atom store could potentially be all the persistence you
                need, though I'm unclear on how you'd do general querying and
                reporting with the APP. Querying probably is best implemented
                just with ad hoc systems for now.

                    Another problem is that it scales very poorly if a reader
                    wants to stay informed of <em>all</em> comments on a weblog.
                    You don’t know when someone will post a comment on a
                    long-silent entry, so you would usually need to poll them
                    all.

                    The APP offers enough introspection to guide the posting of
                    Atom entries and collections, but it is silent on querying.
                    As you say anyone can implement an ad hoc query interface
                    against their Atom store. No surprise that Google has
                    offered a query and authentication interface:
                    <a
                        class="reference"
                        href="http://code.google.com/apis/gdata/protocol.html"
