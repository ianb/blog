                I started playing around with ideas. In the end I came up with
                <a

                    href="http://svn.colorstudy.com/home/ianb/working-env.py"
                    >working-env.py</a

                <a
                    class="reference"
                    href="http://peak.telecommunity.com/DevCenter/EasyInstall#creating-a-virtual-python"
                    >virtual-python.py</a
                >, but perhaps &quot;lighter&quot;, because it doesn't create
                lots of symlinks or a new Python interpreter.
            </p>
            <p>Basically it works like:</p>
            <pre class="literal-block">
$ python working-env.py new-working-env
$ source new-working-env/bin/activate
</pre
            >

                >
                script just sets some environmental variables; mostly equivalent
                to
                <tt class="docutils literal"
                    ><span class="pre">export</span>
                    <span class="pre"

                Setting

                >
                is what activates the working environment. Your path will be
                fixed up. Optionally (and by default)
                <tt class="docutils literal"
                    ><span class="pre">site-packages</span></tt
                >
                <em>won't</em> be picked up, so the only thing you bring in from
                external sources is the standard library. I'd like to add some
                support for copying over packages from
                <tt class="docutils literal"
                    ><span class="pre">site-packages</span></tt
                >
                explicitly, probably with Egg-style annotation and links. E.g.,
                <tt class="docutils literal"
                    ><span class="pre">copy_package</span>
                    <span class="pre">psycopg</span>
                    <span class="pre">version=2.0</span></tt
                >
                will create
                <tt class="docutils literal"
                    ><span class="pre">psycopg-2.0.egg-info/</span></tt
                >, fix up your
                <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">.pth</span></tt>
                file, etc.
            </p>
            <p>
                It monkeypatches distutils to do this. I think that's nice and
                effective. It also monkeypatches setuptools, which isn't
                sustainable -- distutils isn't a moving target, so the patch is
                pretty stable, but setuptools is a different story. For
                setuptools it is changing the way scripts are generated, so that
                the working environment is hardcoded into the script (i.e.,
                using
                <tt class="docutils literal"
                    ><span class="pre"
                        >new-working-env/bin/some-script</span
                    ></tt
                >
                automatically activates that working environment).
            </p>
            <p>
                I'm still trying to figure this out, but I feel fairly good
                about working-env.py; I'm very interested in feedback.

                    It's amazingly comforting to know you can't mess it up
                    unless you actively try to mess it up. That's something this
                    (and virtual-python.py) handles that several other options
                    don't handle.

                    I checked sys.path and there's no setuptools anywhere in it.
                    When I went back to the global python, it does pick up all

                        The setuptools stuff is hacky, and now I can't remember
                        why I did it the way I did. That
                        lib/python2.4/setuptools.pth file should contain the
                        real path to setuptools, which gets used by
                        setuptools/__init__.py. I put in a slightly better error
                        message in this case (at least not NameError). I've been
                        trying to figure out if working-env.py should actually
                        install setuptools locally as part of the setup; it kind

                            I think that would be a logical way to do it. I was
                            admittedly surprised that system-wide setuptools was
                            required by working-env, since I was used to putting
                            it locally into a virtual-python. I think it would
                            be less hassle if it were possible to use
                            working-env as a pre-setuptools bootstrap. Perhaps
                            working-env could optionally/automatically run
                            ez_setup.py within the newly-created environment?

                                I have to second this comment. The whole reason
                                for me running something like working-env or
                                virtual-python is so that I don't have to mess
                                with my virgin Python installation. If I have to
                                install setuptools first, it kind of defeats the
                                purpose....

                            Your activate script is also kind of tricky (i.e.,
                            it looks like &quot;activating&quot; twice really
                            means deactivate). If I may make a suggestion to
                            rename it &quot;toggle-wenv&quot; or something to
                            make that clearer.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Also, if PYTHONPATH is unset when it is run, the new
                            PYTHONPATH will have a trailing ':' which may result
                            in including the current working directory in the
                            PYTHONPATH which may not be the best idea. It also
                            may be harmless, but I don't think it hurts to be
                            careful, especially if other modifying scripts
                            acticipate a well-formed PYTHONPATH variable.

                            In addition, I might suggest using more unique names
                            for your saved PYTHONPATH and PATH variables (this
                            is a common trick and one probably doesn't want to
                            risk a name clash). Here's a patch for
                            working-env.py which includes all my suggestions
                            (it's also a little friendlier to those WORKING_ENV
                            paths which contain spaces:
