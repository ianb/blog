        <h1>PyLogo</h1>
        <p>
            I just released <a href="http://pylogo.org">PyLogo</a>, a
            <a href="http://el.media.mit.edu/logo-foundation/">Logo</a>
            interpreter written in, of course, Python. I've been having a lot of
            fun with it, maybe because a Logo interpreter is a bit more
            accessible than the Python interpreter, because it's a simpler
            language. And of course because it's always more fun to program
            <i>in</i> Python (which is probably why
            <a href="http://codespeak.net/pypy/">PyPy</a> would be fun).
        </p>

        <p>
            I have other things I should probably be working on, but sometimes I
            just can't stand working on things I should be working on and want
            to work on things for which I have absolutely no personal itch.
        </p>

        <p>
            The other thing I'm hoping to explore in this is some of the
            programming philosophies of Logo (I'd highly recommend the classic
            book
            <a
                href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0465046746/qid%3D1067922418/sr%3Dka-2/ref%3Dpd%5Fka%5F2/104-5956529-5435122"
                >Mindstorms</a
            >
            to anyone interested in programming [or math] education). Logo has
            very different design goals than Python (though
            <a href="http://www.python.org/doc/essays/cp4e.html">not entirely</a
            >), and these come out in interesting ways in the language. I
            actually think there's some ways Python could move towards Logo's
            accessibility; maybe I'll say PyLogo is an attempt to work from both
            directions.

            O _SURE_, bring up the Python Logo issue again, and to DARE bring up
            Python's philosphy in it's design! ;-)

            O man...in checking Edu-Sig list to see if you'd announced it I see
            my jokes been used.
