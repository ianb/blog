                I got the experimental version of
                <a class="reference" href="http://pythonpaste.org/wphp/"
                    >WPHP</a
                >
                working last night. This allows you to represent a PHP
                application as a WSGI application; you make
                <tt class="docutils literal"
                    ><span class="pre">wphp.PHPApp(base_dir)</span></tt
                >, and it'll spawn a PHP/FastCGI subprocess and hand requests
                off there.
            </p>
            <p>
                I
                <a class="reference" href="python-fcgi-server.html"
                    >asked a little while back</a
                >
                about a FastCGI server-side/client module, which is what this
                uses, but no such thing existed. After trying really not very
                hard to write it myself, I emailed
                <a class="reference" href="http://www.saddi.com/software/news/"
                    >Allan Saddi</a
                >
                to see if he was interested, and then he emailed me back an
                implementation the next day. So that was pretty sweet. From
                there, WPHP just handles starting the PHP process and fixing up
                the environment some (PHP requires the
                <tt class="docutils literal"
                    ><span class="pre">SCRIPT_FILENAME</span></tt
                >
                environmental variable, for instance, and we have to handle
                non-PHP files on our own).
            </p>
            <p>
                This means that PHP applications can be embedded in Python
                systems. This may not seem that exciting, until you have
                interesting WSGI middleware.

                and other kinds of middleware can be layed over the PHP output.
            </p>
            <p>
                Next up for me: finishing
                <a

                    >some work</a

                to let you embed WSGI apps in Zope and vice versa.

                        Got an existing WSGI project, and want to quickly add a
                        forum or other existing PHP software (perhaps a bespoke
                        application that you want to replace over time with a
                        python one)?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Use this code with an existing WSGI dispatcher to let
                        PHP handle part of your site. Even more excitingly, you
                        could rewrite the PHP application to generate basic HTML
                        (or XML) through its template system, then have your
                        WSGI templating system producing the output for both PHP
                        and python applications. A WSGI middleware application
                        would be also able to do single sign-on for both sets of
                        applications...
                    </p>
                    <p>Heck, you could even wrap a Rails application.</p>
                    <p>
                        All in all, a very good way of being able to add
                        functionality to existing web applications, without
                        having to touch any of its code. Good work, Ian!

Hi,
your WPHP app is being extremely helpful in my effort in integrating RoundCube (php based) into twisted.web2!

I had to patch line 370 in file fcgi_app.py:

header, value = line.split(':',1)

Otherwise headers with multiple : produce exceptions. For example:
&quot;Expires: Thu, 01 Dec 1994 16:00:00 GMT&quot;

Kind regards,
DQ
