                    >tried to explain WSGIKit</a

                asked for diagrams, but I don't think in terms of diagrams (even
                if I appreciate that it's very useful for other people), so I'm
                not sure what one would look like. I made a couple diagrams for

                But anyway, I want to write about
                <em>what WSGIKit can do for you, the framework developer</em>.
                To do this, I want to explain Webware's relation to WSGIKit,
                which is a concrete example of how this stuff can fit together.

                        WSGIKit because it's a reimplementation of Webware. If
                        you didn't want to reimplement your framework, or you
                        wanted to do all your framework development in your
                        repository, you wouldn't necessarily add a subpackage,
                        you'd just use your normal distribution.

                        The Webware package turns Servlets into WSGI

                        in a lot of ways it's actually pretty simple. If you

                        uses some simple rules to construct WSGI applications --
                        it loads modules, then looks for the symbol

                        applications. The Webware Servlet subclass is a factory
                        for Servlet instances, which are themselves WSGI

                        Some frameworks would be able to use this, or maybe
                        offer modifications of this, while other frameworks will
                        have to implement new URL parsers.

                        makes use of this). Frameworks can have multiple
                        templates (e.g., someone could write a
                        <tt class="docutils literal"
                            ><span class="pre">webkit_cheetah</span></tt
                        >
                        template), and the application templates can provide new
                        commands. So sometime I'm planning to add a
                        <tt class="docutils literal"
                            ><span class="pre">app-setup</span>

                        >
                        command to
                        <tt class="docutils literal"
                            ><span class="pre">webkit_zpt</span></tt
                        >
                        that will create a new blank servlet and template. None
                        of the application template stuff is required, but I
                        think it's a very helpful aid to new users (and
                        convenient for experienced users too).

                        configuration and application assembly pluggable, but
                        for now it'd probably mean hardcoding something for each
                        framework in there. Actually, I plan to rename
                        <tt class="docutils literal"

                        to something like
                        <tt class="docutils literal"
                            ><span class="pre">publish_dir</span></tt

                        file-publishing-specific. But I'm
                        <em>very</em> reluctant to turn configuration into
                        something complicated, so right now I'm expecting to
                        code many use cases into
                        <tt class="docutils literal"
                            ><span class="pre">server</span></tt
                        >
                        instead of making configuration more generic or general.

                OK, so if you set up your framework to work with WSGIKit, what
                would you get out of it?

                    You get

                    if you make application templates. You can make such a thing
                    on your own (Webware had
                    <tt class="docutils literal"

                    for instance). But this script provides a somewhat
                    consistent experience for users, and convenience functions

                    You get a configuration setup. It's fairly simple -- and
                    maybe it can stay fairly simple. The same configuration file
                    works for both servers and applications, and can hold
                    information specific to your framework or applications.

                <li>
                    You get glue for various servers. There's a couple supported
                    now, including a simple HTTP server, a print-to-stdout
                    server, a CGI-script-generating server, and an SCGI forking
                    server. There will be more in the future.

                <li>
                    Servers can be restarted automatically when code changes
                    (configurable), dealing with the dreaded stale code problem.

                <li>
                    Access to a bunch of reusable components and libraries, like
                    serving of static files, catching errors and providing a
                    variety of reports, session management, authentication, and
                    more to come.

                    As much backward compatibility as we can muster. Deployment
                    and configuration changes, but most everything else
                    shouldn't.

                I also think the test and documentation framework is heading in

                You don't have to use all of this to pick features and code out
                of WSGIKit if you wish. A lot of what I'm looking to provide
                with WSGIKit is a good experience for users, both new and
                experienced, and part of what that means is having other people
                put things together in intelligent ways instead of leaving it up
                to each developer to do so. Wouldn't it be great to tell someone
                evaluating Python web programming to download one (maybe big)
                hunk of code, run
                <tt class="docutils literal"
                    ><span class="pre">app-setup</span>
                    <span class="pre">list</span></tt
                >
                to see a dozen available Python frameworks,
                <tt class="docutils literal"
                    ><span class="pre">app-setup</span>
                    <span class="pre">list</span>
                    <span class="pre">-v</span></tt
                >
                to get extended descriptions,
                <tt class="docutils literal"
                    ><span class="pre">app-setup</span>
                    <span class="pre">--template=X</span>

                to get a demo of any of the frameworks set up? That's not the
                end-all-be-all of resolving issues with Python web development,
                but I think it's an accessible goal <em>right now</em>, and
                worth doing.

                    and restarts the entire server if one of them changes. It is
                    not initiated by a request, but rather runs in a separate
                    thread and polls the files regularly. You can also make it
                    look at extra files, like a configuration file, and restart
                    when those change too. It doesn't reload modules, which is
                    much more challenging to do correctly, though at some point
                    I'll probably have it look at modules and see if some are
                    explicitly marked to be reloadable. E.g., Webware servlet
                    files (but <em>not</em> the files they import) can generally
                    be reloaded.

                Given the current state of Python web programming I would say
                that WSGI is a good standard to leverage, but I don't think that
                &quot;thin glue&quot; accurately describes a real-world WSGI
                implementation. Even if WSGI is the most efficient way to bring
                the plethora of ideas into focus, it's really more like
                &quot;thick glue&quot; or &quot;mortar&quot;. Fitting some of
                this stuff together is more like building with rocks than
                bricks. If this analogy is good, then the goal is not to chip
                every piece into a new shape, but to knock off the protruding
                edges so that they can be fitted.
