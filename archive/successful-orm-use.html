            With object-relational technologies, products begin by flirting with
            simple mappings: single class to single table, building simple
            Proxies that do some Lazy Loading, and so on. "Advisers" are sent in
            to the various project teams that use the initial O-R layer, but
            before long, those "advisers" are engaging in front-line coding,
            wrestling with ways to bring object inheritance to the relational
            database.
        </blockquote>

        I think some of the problems with ORMs are due to being too Object, and
        not enough Relational. It's entirely appropriate -- obvious, even --
        that the database should be represented through objects. It is nice if
        the structure of the database is also represented through objects,
        hopefully at a fine level of detail. When you create SQL strings, you
        are hiding the structure in relatively opaque strings. When you have
        query results that are just lists of lists, or lists of dictionaries,
        you have lost a lot of information.

        <p>
            So, you want good objects. The problems I see is when you try to
            represent <i>classes</i> through the ORM, or relatedly when you do
            modeling and then apply the ORM after. Objects are fine and well,
            but it's still an RDBMS you are dealing with. Concepts like
            subclassing just don't make sense. <i>Is-a</i> is not a term you
            should be thinking about. And when you are using your objects, you
            shouldn't expect to forget what they really are -- connectors to the
            database.
        </p>

        <p>
            I think a good ORM needs to be simple and transparent in the way it
            deals with the database, so you don't forget what you are dealing
            with. But I <i>don't</i> think it needs to represent every
            relational programming concept natively. Just as an object
            programmer needs to think about relations, a relational programmer
            needs to think about objects, and the ORM should be the intersection
            of those two, not the union.

            Unless, of course, it isn't. Part of the appeal of an ORM in my
            experience is the ability to also transparently persist objects in
            containers which are not RDBMS's. My current example: a biz app
            which has two storage mechanisms; one is a relational DB--the kind
            of thing SQLObject would work perfectly with. But half the data is
            stored in a third-party container, which provides SQL for reading,
            but a proprietary API for writing, which models objects completely
            differently.
            <br />

            Sorry, I don't buy it. Abstraction is forgetfulness, IMO.

            I'm with Ian here, the nail has been firmly hit on the head. Every
            time I've come across object relational mapping it's OO programmers
            trying to persist an object model in a database. Its all in the
            compromise, and using the strengths of both approaches rather than
            sticking only to one.

            ORM tools have two different jobs depending on what comes first in
            the design: with objects first there is persistence, portable to
            different datastores because the objects remain the same and as
            transparent as possible because one only needs to write objects and
            get them back; with database first there is a struggle to perform
            database operations and present data as objects in the context of a
            certain program: the transparency and portability are turned around
            (any program can use the OO view of a certain database provided by
            the tool and all database clients are the same).

                    I partly agree with you. But after the class generation,
                    then those classes are saved in the persistance layer and
                    the mapping files are also generated.After that you can
                    perform the operation on xml. ORM is very powerful tool
                    because it provide database independence. If you have any
                    objection, you can mail me at
