</div><h1>An Ideal Python Web Programming Environment</h1>
 <p>

W while ago I wrote this list of features I'd like in a Python web
programming environment.  It was before WSGI (which I think is a big
step forward); but I realized most of these features aren't aspects
which WSGI really addresses.  I've edited the list down to things that
can happen on the WSGI server/middleware side.

<p>

<ol>
  <li> Deployable in a variety of environments.  This includes
  Windows, Unix, Apache, IIS, with its own HTTP server, or behind
  other reasonably sane servers.  Bonus if it can optionally integrate
  with its environment in some way -- while environment neutrality is
  nice, <i>optional</i> environment neutrality is much better.

  <li> Highly reliable in the face of bugs.  Writing bad code cannot
  take the server down.  <i>Maybe</i> malicious code could take down
  the server -- it's never going to be safe to give enemies access to
  a full Python system.  But poorly-written code should be expected.

  <li> Some reliability even when infinite loops, massive memory use,
  or other resource hogs are encountered.

  <li> Hopefully, bad C code won't take the
  entire server down either (though it will inevitably take down
  at least that one request).  Maybe bad C code is too difficult to
  protect against, but it shouldn't be totally catastrophic to the
  server if it happens.  The server should in no circumstances
  disappear or indefinitely stop handling requests.

  <li> Reasonable to manage in a multi-user environment, where users
  don't trust each other.  I.e., shared commercial hosts.

  <li> No cryptic behavior, no allowing files and in-data objects to
  get out of sync, no manual managing of reloading code.  Managing
  that manually burdens the programmer in the same way a compilation
  step burdens the programmer.

  <li> Easy to debug.  No "transparent" recompiling that will provide
  a disconnect between what the programmer writes and what they see in
  the traceback.  Lots of good logging facilities, post-mortem
  debugging facilities, application hooks for indicating context, and
  interactive debugging systems for use when initially developing
  applications.

  <li> Scales reasonably.  (E.g., CGI isn't an option, because it scales
  poorly when the code becomes more complex and process startup time
  becomes too great; even if it actually scales fine for a large
  number of requests.)

  <li> Could serve all HTTP needs reasonably efficiently.  Maybe
  Apache is faster at serving static files, but this framework should
  at least be decent.  No large file issues.

  <li> No impediments to using normal Python libraries.

</ol>

<p>

This is the kind of environment issue that hasn't been tackled by many
frameworks.  Zope has tried in a couple different ways; sometimes
implementing one of these features has compromised another.  Some of
the forking systems have also implemented some of these features.  It
would be nice to see a complete solution.  Maybe some of these would
require changes to the interpreter itself?  While other aspects of the
solution might even be neutral with respect to Python, e.g.,
watchdogs.

<p>

I <i>don't</i> think that platform neutrality is absolutely essential.
A lot of these features aren't semantic, and they won't change how
your program works.  Instead, I think it's better to do the best we
can on each platform -- portable bugs and portable unreliability in
systems isn't useful.  If we can get a system that is great on Linux,
pretty good on FreeBSD, and passable on Windows, then great -- that's
better than just passable on every platform.  And what makes a great
solution on Linux might simply not apply to Windows.

<p>

The cool thing about the WSGI, is that if you solved many of these
problems, they could be applied to most frameworks that were built on
the WSGI.

<p>

Right now I think this stuff is more strategically important for
Python web programming than is a pleasant programming environment.
Things don't need to be perfect -- programmers can adapt, and to some
degree will always have to adapt.  But this foundational server
structure is something that a typical programmer can't fix.  These
features are also an appeal to system administrators, who are
sometimes ignored when programmers define priorities.

 You might take a look at <a href="http://nick.borko.org/pse" target="_blank">Python Servlet Engine</a> -- a former colleague of mine developed it with some of my input. It's a simple system, but has a superb system for separating presentation from logic without throwing away reusuable components, has decent debugging, and runs well with mod_python (could be expanded for other systems.) One could expand its capability for cross-platform use.
<br />

<br />
I've used WingIDE to debug it, and it works well.

 Does fast cgi solve the scalability problem ? and mod_python ?

 In my experience mod_python is not very solid. I built one web site with mod_python 2.7 and found it to be very fragile--the application seemed to break very easily. Scripts that did practically nothing worked very well, but more complex pages had erratic performance.

 Ian, you seems to have quite the same issue as me. 
<br />
This post sound like the dilemma1/2.
<br />

<br />

<br />
In fact, i think the ideal system should support pdb debugging (like w/ a medusa server), and mod_python for production. 
<br />

<br />

<br />
mod_python provide:
<br />
- variety of env 
<br />
- reliable (in fact you will crash a sub-interpreter, but apparently not the main one.) And even if this occur, apache will free it, so you can hope the next request will work.
<br />
- reasonalbe multi-user env. That why I end up w/ webware, having to launch every server is a mess. And worst it's eating memory and others even for website than never get 1 hit.
<br />
- scales well
<br />

<br />
Now i'm not a mod_python guru, so i decide to use quixote, because it provide medusa and mod_python. so debugging and large scale support

 IMO, FastCGI is an ideal solution, and I've actually used it for running Python apps serving millions of dynamic hits per month.  (And could easily have scaled it much further by adding hardware).
<br />

<br />
The advantage of FastCGI is that your application runs in a separate process than the web server, so you can scale it differently in terms of the ideal number of processes.  You're not consuming huge amounts of memory due to having dozens of Apache processes each with a copy of your app, if you only need maybe five copies of your app running to handle the load.  So, for complex applications I would choose FastCGI over mod_python for those reasons.
<br />

<br />
(Also, by appropriate use of forking, a FastCGI application can have very fast startups for additional copies of the application, and can kill them off when not needed.  PEAK includes a "process supervisor" tool that manages this, by listening to the same socket and keeping track of which child processes are busy.)

 mod_python doesn't seem like a very good idea in a multi-user situation, because the interpreter is persistent between requests.  At the same time, those requests may be going to two different users.  In that way one user could corrupt or disrupt another user's interpreter.  Also, since it's a single process, you only have one level of permissions.
<br />

<br />
Ideally, of course, you would run one Apache instance for each user.  This is actually not a bad idea, as each Apache instance can run under that user's account, with configuration separated out.  But there's also problems.  And maybe the overhead is less with the new Apache 2 threaded model, but then you lose the good parts of keeping interpreters partitioned.
<br />

<br />
Also, mod_python doesn't work well with Apache 1.3.  In my experience, it's not a big deal to upgrade, but people are extremely reluctant to do so.  Really they should have called it 1.4, then people would be much less stressed about it -- there's substantial changes, but Apache's front-facing features have remained extremely stable over the releases.  But I digress.
<br />

<br />
As is often the case, in a heterogeneous environment you can solve problems more completely by <i>not</i> reusing components (like Apache's worker process model).  Obviously there are also problems with this.  E.g., FastCGI is nicely partitioned, but it's also a leaf in the system, where mod_python can interject itself at different points in a site's system, providing consistency in a heterogeneous system.
 <div align="right"><a href="http://blog.ianbicking.org/comment402.html" rel="nofollow">#</a> Ian Bicking</div><hr noshade>
 mod_python can use several interpreters to handle the multi-user situation, because you can name the main sub-process and bind it to a virtual host. 
<br />

<br />
For the level of permissions: this is how php works too. and there is billions of php users here.(yes you can use suexec + php as cgi but you can do the same w/ python). Anyway, if you want this kind of situations (I want for part of my projects) you can use mod_scgi w/ quixote. So you can reuse, and separate. 
<br />

<br />
But mod_python require apache 2, and yes this is pain to install. For example, there is no php module for apache2 in debian (there is a one for apache2-prefork but...) 
<br />

<br />
I haven't put quixote + mod_python in production right now. but develop w/ quixote and medusa is really easy, and I think that: with the bunch of way to deploy quixote (medusa + apache proxy, mod_scgi, pure cgi, cgi + FastCGI, twisted, mod_python) i gonna find the best way to handle the requests. 
<br />
