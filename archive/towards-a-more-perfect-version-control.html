                What he describes is very user-interface-oriented, from the
                perspective of bug and patch tracking as much as version
                control. It makes for an interesting overlap. Here's a kind of
                use case he gives:
            </p>
            <blockquote>
                <ol class="arabic simple">
                    <li>
                        The version control system keeps track of how to submit
                        patches (mailing list, bugzilla, etc.) and has a
                        &quot;submit patch&quot; command. (Prereq: the system
                        has a concept of a patch you're working on for
                        submission)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The version control system tracks submitted patches for
                        the maintainer and supports easy review and
                        acceptance/rejection of them.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Easy way to have a conversation about any patch (as we
                        do now in bugzilla typically)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Allow the maintainer to easily hack on the patch, merge
                        their changes with it, and then bounce the patch back to
                        the submitter for more work - I often want to just fix
                        the nitpicks instead of writing them down, then give
                        someone the patch back to fix the big stuff.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Often you want to commit a number of times before you
                        submit a patch officially (sometimes people will make a
                        CVS branch for this). A nice feature would be to avoid
                        the need to do this manually; just have the developer
                        tools automatically &quot;commit&quot; every time you
                        save from the editor, or even make the whole undo buffer
                        persistent. Much more plausible with monotone than with
                        CVS.

            <p>I can imagine doing this entirely within version control:</p>
            <ol class="arabic">

                    <p class="first">
                        The version control system makes branching really easy.
                        You start editing your checkout, and then there's a kind
                        of &quot;commit as branch&quot; command. If it's a
                        distributed system then there isn't really anything like
                        a &quot;checkout&quot; (which is fine), but something
                        more like &quot;upload as branch&quot;.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p class="first">
                        Perhaps simply by filename convention, tracking is part
                        of the version control system. So if you wanted to
                        submit the patch for review, maybe you'd put
                        <tt class="docutils literal"
                            ><span class="pre">request-review.txt</span></tt
                        >
                        in the system, with a note of explanation (what the
                        branch accomplishes or fixes).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The entire repository, with all branches, should be well
                        indexed. It should include workflow-related concepts.
                        This could be as simple as text tags indicating status
                        that are manually edited.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Thinking a little more -- tag the branch
                        &quot;for-review&quot; (this is <em>not</em> like
                        Subversion &quot;tags&quot;; more like setting a
                        Subversion property). Add a property &quot;author&quot;
                        that has your information. Another property lists people
                        who are interested in being notified about changes to
                        the branch. Another rule notifies maintainer(s) that
                        something has been submitted. And an indexer displays
                        what branches are in what states (for-review, in-review,
                        rejected, accepted, etc).
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p class="first">
                        The conversation takes place in more text files. Maybe
                        the VC frontend handles the formatting. Or not,
                        whatever.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In addition to indexing there's notification. You can
                        register your interest in a branch. Maybe an email
                        gateway for these conversations, where the conversation
                        is appended to that discussion file. It's like the
                        <tt class="docutils literal"
                            ><span class="pre">Talk:</span></tt
                        >
                        pages in Wikipedia.

                        Good merging tools make it easy to bring together

                        When you want to change a patch but submit back to the
                        author for further changes, you just edit their branch.
                        Non-authoritative branches (like those that are
                        submitted by non-maintainers) are editable by everyone.
                        You could even simply add comments inline to the code
                        about issues you see with the changes.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I think the ability for maintainers to edit non-trunk
                        (and non-official-branch) code is a really important way
                        to communicate with contributors. And for contributors
                        to communicate with each other; this shouldn't be a
                        wheel-and-spoke system centered around one integrator.
                    </p>
                </li>

                    <p class="first">
                        Autocommit is a separate issue, I think. It would be
                        fine if an editor did this, but it's not something that
                        screams out to me.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        History is more easily available if everything is a
                        branch, not a patch, and branches have history and you
                        can continue development on them without being merged
                        into the trunk.
                    </p>
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                This doesn't really address issue trackers. Issue trackers are
                lists of problems without solutions, and source control
                typically holds solutions. If the version control (or maybe just
                the tools built around it) was really powerful, then potentially
                it could be a backend for issue tracking, where
                &quot;issues&quot; are special files or directories. But the
                workflow for issues is typically much more automated and
                structured than for generic &quot;source&quot;.

                    In our enterprise development one of the things that I have
                    been working on putting together is a way that error
                    reporting, trouble ticketing, version control, unit test
                    coverage, and IDE are tied together.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If an unexplained error happens a support person is
                    automatically assigned a trouble ticket and emailed. Tech
                    does initial research and closes out ticket because he could
                    handle the problem or bucks it up to the developers with
                    what ever information he could glean. Developer researches,
                    resolves the issue if he can, generates additional unit
                    testing. New trouble ticket is generated for each developer
                    to peer review the new unit tests and the patch. Reports at
                    the end of the month about what code was changed and who
                    changed it, did it cause problems, what kind of problems and
                    how was it fixed.

                    I have been using Roundup as an issue management for a while
                    and I do already create trouble tickets based on events in
                    applications via email. The next step is tying in the
                    versioning system. There has been many developments with
                    Roundup and SVN in the last few months. So I think that this
                    is what I need to set up next. My dream isn't too far away.

                    I have only been trying it out for a little while now, but
                    it has a few features that could be glued (with a little bit
                    of Python or something) to Bugzilla or any number of other
                    development tracking tools.

                        It supports arbitrary metadata attached to submissions
                        and changes. This could be used to track the status of a
                        patch, where the current discussion is taking place, a
                        bug number, etc.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        It supports multiple head revisions. So people working
                        on the patch can simply work on a seperate head until
                        the patch is approved, then merge it into the
                        &quot;official&quot; head.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        It is very configurable. It uses
                        <a class="reference" href="http://www.lua.org">Lua:</a>
                        as its configuration language, and it has a large number
                        of hooks that can be customized.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        It has a &quot;scripting&quot; version for its commands
                        to make it easy to automate most tasks.
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    I guess all that is needed is a bit of work to tie it all
                    together. There are already a few projects that integrate
                    with it, but I couldn't find any that integrate with bug
                    tracking or email patch submission systems.

                    There seems to be a bit of convergence on this idea; I know
                    we've tossed around such stuff some in monotone, especially
                    when we were also experimenting with using our regression
                    test suite as a bug tracking system -- I think that's a very
                    powerful bit of integration for such a system to include, by
                    the way -- and Aaron Bentley's actually put together a
                    system called
                    <a

                    My biggest problem with such a scheme is that part of what
                    issue trackers do is track discussions; and discussions do
                    not follow branch semantics. You generally want your
                    discussions to be global -- gathering together comments from
                    two different branches to figure out what's been done on a
                    bug sounds like a royal pain. OTOH, bug states (open,
                    closed, ...) very much do follow branch semantics -- closing
                    a bug in a branch, then having it closed on mainline when
                    the branch is integrated, is very slick. I'm not sure what
                    the right solution is.

                    I'm hoping that as these systems get a little more mature
                    we'll see a lot more work on workflow processes and stuff...

                    For coupling issue (and ticket) tracking and source control
                    I've been very impressed by
                    <a class="reference" href="http://trac.edgewall.com"

                    We're currently using it for ad-hoc documentation, source
                    code viewing, and ticket tracking (we started with issues
                    but now every piece of work has an associated ticket). It's
                    really nice being able to cross reference change sets, wiki
                    pages and tickets in the same environment.

                        I've used Trac as an issue tracker, and I've liked it
                        well enough as that. I somewhat prefer Roundup for more
                        involved issue tracking, but I think Trac has a more
                        accessible UI for public projects. But I haven't felt
                        any real motivation to use any of its other features (or
                        Roundup Subversion integration for that matter). I don't
                        need Yet Another Wiki (and worse Yet Another Wiki
                        Markup). That's not how I want to keep my documentation.
                        The Subversion integration might be good, but I never
                        remember to link them up. They are too far away from
                        each other, IMHO; web and svn client are very different
                        modes for me.
