</div><h1>Job Posting: Web Interface Specialist</h1>
 
<div class="document">
<p>We (<a class="reference" href="http://imagescape.com">Imaginary Landscape</a>) are looking for a Web Interface
Specialist.  In other words, an expert in HTML, Javascript, and CSS.
This is a full-time position in Chicago.</p>
<p>There's a <a class="reference" href="http://jobsearch.monster.com/getjob.asp?JobID=27632211&amp;AVSDM=2005%2D02%2D24+14%3A07%3A55">posting on Monster</a>, but I'll describe the job instead of
describing the requirements.</p>
<p>Imaginary Landscape is a small web development company (maybe 15
employees now?), and you'll be working both with people in content
development (the people who do editing, converting documents clients
give us, general website maintenance, etc.) and programming (people
like me).  I imagine your roles will be contrasting -- providing the
technical support for the content people and design support for the
programming people.  But in the end you'll be working with everyone,
and everyone contributes in whatever way they are best able to finish
the projects we have.  It's a relaxed environment without a great deal
of stress (<a class="reference" href="http://64.233.167.104/search?q=cache:6KMJDJYrHwkJ:c2.com/cgi/wiki%3F">40-hour week</a> style), no distracting politics, and the
organization is generally transparent.</p>
<p>Also in the job you won't be pigeonholed into a small set of tasks;
depending on the company's needs and your own inclinations there's
always opportunities for you to work in new and interesting areas to
expand the breadth of your experience.</p>
<p>We're an open source shop, using almost no proprietary software (at
least on the server -- though personally I don't use any on my
workstation either).  Cross browser compatiblity is a given for all
our projects (though personally I have this idea that at some point
we're going to be able to do something so compelling with Mozilla that
we could actually give up IE compatibility -- but I haven't figured
out what that is yet; it can't be on the public portion of a site).
We don't let expedience get in the way of quality.</p>
<p>We also recently lost our Perl programmer -- he'd been working
remotely for many years, but decided to take a normal day job (I hear
he's even wearing a tie).  Anyway, we don't do a lot of Perl
programming, but if you have experience in that it would be useful for
maintenance tasks.  But HTML, Javascript, and CSS is the core skill
set that we are looking for.</p>
<p>If you are interested, send your resume and a cover letter to
<a class="reference" href="mailto:employment&#64;imagescape.com">employment&#64;imagescape.com</a> -- please copy me too (ianb -at- imagescape
-dot- com), since I'm curious who (if anyone) applies because of this
blog.  And of course I'm naturally biased towards anyone who reads my
blog, so I can put in a good word for you ;)</p>
