        <h1>Declarative Classes</h1>
        After thinking about
        <a href="http://blog.colorstudy.com/ianb/weblog/2003/09/15.html#P6"
            >metaclasses and reloading</a
        >
        a little bit, it should be clear that the simple approach won't work.
        You can't update a class (and especially a class's <tt>__init__</tt>)
        and expect all the instances to be valid. Maybe you add an instance
        variable, or take a new argument to the __init__ that specifies the
        behavior, or cache some values. Because you can't rerun
        <tt>__init__</tt>, you can't ensure valid objects.
        <p>
            There are a few solutions to this, all of which require a different
            style of defining classes than is typical in Python.
        </p>

        <p>
            One would be to make <tt>__init__</tt> idempotent; that is, you can
            call <tt>__init__</tt> multiple times without changing the instance.
            Presumably you also store the original arguments so you can
            reconstruct the <tt>__init__</tt> call completely. Using something
            like
            <a
                href="http://aspn.activestate.com/ASPN/Cookbook/Python/Recipe/160164"
                >Michael Hudson's recipe</a
            >
            you can keep track of all the instances, and reinitialize them.
        </p>

        <p>
            Another would be to make changes to <tt>__init__</tt> less common.
            This can be achieved by using higher-level definitions.
            <a href="http://peak.telecommunity.com/">PEAK</a> is an interesting
            framework which does some of this. (See the
            <a href="http://peak.telecommunity.com/tut.pdf">Tutorial</a> (PDF),
            section 2.2)
        </p>

        <p>
            In essence you can consider PEAK's bindings to be using declaration
            in favor of execution. Python has a strong bias to execution.
            Instances variables aren't declared; you simply create them and they
            exist. Methods aren't declared; they are just functions attached to
            classes. Local variables aren't declared, you just start using them.
            A
            <tt>property</tt> isn't declared; you explicitly construct it and
            bind it. Classes aren't declared; they are created (which is the
            source of this specific reloading problem).
        </p>

        <p>
            PEAK's bindings seem to be a way of creating a declared class. Many
            typical patterns -- patterns which typically would be implemented
            idiomatically -- are instead turned into explicit structures. For
            instance, <tt>binding.Once</tt> (pg. 13) encapsulates a basic
            memoizing pattern, where you calculate a value lazily then store the
            value for future accesses. You can implement this idiomatically,
            perhaps like:
        </p>

        <pre>
class Car(object):
    def height__get(self):
        try:
            return self.__height
        except AttributeError:
            baseHeight = self.roof.top - self.chassis.bottom
            self.__height = self.wheels.radius + self.baseHeight
            return self.__height
</pre
        >

        It's not difficult to understand what's happening there by reading the
        code. But a tool (like a reload-enabling metaclass)
        <i>cannot</i> understand that code. In the case of reloading and
        instance variables, we might want an explicit declaration of what
        variables instances should have, and a default value for that variable.
        Given that we can fix up old instances.
        <p>
            Of course, reloading is only a very specific case, and not the most
            interesting case either. Persistence is so "interesting" that it's
            practically cliche. Publishing, security, interfaces -- these all
            benefit from declarative structures.
        </p>

        <p>
            I think the challenge is in making the declarations small (they
            quickly become a conceptual burden) and dynamic, so that they can
            reap the benefits of Python.
