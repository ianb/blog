        <div class="document">
            <p>
                I am happy to announce the release of Paste 1.0. This release
                includes all the major components: Paste (core), Paste Script,
                Paste Deploy, and Paste WebKit.
            </p>
            <p>
                In all honesty Paste passed the 0.x stage a long time ago. But
                now it's official: Paste is really stable. How stable? A lot
                stable. APIs won't be shifting without due warning, and only if
                there's a good reason. The scope of Paste is also going to be
                more constrained -- new work should happen outside of Paste.
                I've already started this a while ago, making most new projects
                of mine independent packages. This is fine for Paste, because
                Paste does not encourage integration, and a module under the
                <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">paste</span></tt>
                namespace has no special abilities or privilege.
            </p>
            <p>
                Of course, <em>some</em> work will continue in Paste, but the
                focus will be on expanding and polishing what's already there,
                while larger work may take the form of extracting pieces from
                Paste (this may very well happen for
                <tt class="docutils literal"
                    ><span class="pre">paste.exceptions</span></tt
                >,
                <tt class="docutils literal"
                    ><span class="pre">paste.evalexception</span></tt
                >
                and
                <tt class="docutils literal"
                    ><span class="pre">paste.auth</span></tt
                >)
            </p>
            <p>
                I realize I haven't tried to explain What Paste Is for a long
                time. It used to be a hobby of mine to misexplain it. Maybe it's
                time to try again.
            </p>
            <div class="section">
                <h1>

                <p>
                    Three entirely different things. Maybe more. These form some
                    sort of unified strategy in my mind -- though only an
                    incomplete strategy -- but there's no reason you should even
                    worry about that.
                </p>
                <div class="section">

                    <p>
                        This is the main
                        <tt class="docutils literal"
                            ><span class="pre">Paste</span></tt
                        >
                        package. This is a bunch of WSGI components. It does all
                        sorts of nice little things. There's an HTTP server in
                        there. There's an HTTP proxying setup. There's a
                        exception catcher. There's something like Apache's
                        ErrorDocument. There's a system for doing internal
                        subrequests. There's some URL parsing. There's static
                        file serving. There are a variety of debugging tools.
                        There's several library routines to handle particular
                        situations in WSGI, like parsing form variables, reading
                        headers, generating error responses, etc.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You can use all of these, though that's unlikely. You
                        can use several. You can use just one. Not much buy-in
                        is really required.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Several of these pieces are kind of low-level. Often a
                        higher-level framework like
                        <a class="reference" href="http://pylonshq.com"
                            >Pylons</a
                        >
                        or
                        <a class="reference" href="http://www.cleverharold.com/"
                            >CleverHarold</a
                        >
                        will wrap these pieces up in a more tasty and cohesive
                        package. Some actually are more deployment-related, like
                        the prefix-based routing in
                        <tt class="docutils literal"
                            ><span class="pre">paste.urlmap</span></tt
                        >, and so you might use them directly.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You can even write your own web framework with Paste.
                        It's really quite easy, you should totally give it a
                        try.
                    </p>
                </div>

                        <a id="paste-deploy" name="paste-deploy"

                        >

                    <p>
                        Paste Deploy is a <em>concept</em>, and an
                        <em>implementation</em>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The <em>concept</em> is that you can represent pieces of
                        a WSGI stack with some simple functions. Each part is
                        pretty simple:
                        <tt class="docutils literal"
                            ><span class="pre">paste.app_factory</span></tt
                        >
                        is a factory that builds WSGI applications.
                        <tt class="docutils literal"
                            ><span class="pre"
                                >paste.filter_app_factory</span
                            ></tt
                        >
                        is a factory that wraps applications with middleware.
                        <tt class="docutils literal"
                            ><span class="pre">paste.server_runner</span></tt
                        >
                        is a function that runs a server with your application.
                        Each kind of function has a particular kind of
                        signature, and if you can wrap your
                        app/middleware/server in that kind of function then
                        other people can handle it in a consistent way.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The <em>implementation</em> is a system that builds a
                        stack of apps, middleware, and a server using an
                        INI-style configuration file.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="section">
                    <h2>
                        <a id="paste-script" name="paste-script"
                            >Paste Script</a
                        >
                    </h2>
                    <p>
                        Paste Script is some command-line glue, and some bits
                        and pieces.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As command-line glue, it lets you do things like load a
                        config file (with Paste Deploy), then actually run it.
                        And little things like change the user ID, daemonize,
                        etc.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It also has stuff to build the file layout for new
                        projects.
                    </p>
                    <p>It also has some stuff to do application deployment.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="section">
                    <h2><a id="conclusion" name="conclusion">Conclusion</a></h2>
                    <p>
                        So that's Paste. If you think you Don't Really Get It,
                        it's probably because you think there's more to it than
                        there is.

            <div class="document">
                <p>
                    Congratulations Ian! Way too many projects never make it to
                    1.0 and most of the rest are not really 1.0 quality when
                    they get there.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Paste reminds me of Python in its excellent technology and
                    difficult product description. The problem is that people
                    better understand descriptions in terms of what problems the
                    code can solve for them. Consider the difference between:
                    &quot;Python is a general purpose object oriented scripting
                    language popular for rapid prototyping, application
                    building, scientific use and many other things.&quot;
                    Compare to: &quot;Ruby is a general purpose programming
                    language most often used to very rapidly build highly
                    mainainable Web sites through its Web Application Framework
                    Rails.&quot;
                </p>
                <p>
                    I don't mean to reopen the whole Web Application Framework
                    question but merely offer an analogy. The next time you
                    describe Paste it would help if you would explain in one
                    sentence what problem I would have that would lead me to use
                    it. Is it three different things because it solves three
                    different problems? If so, why does it have a single name?
                    Or is it three different things that solve the same problem?

                    Paste was easy to understand once I realized what WSGI
                    enables. (Ben Bangert's Google Tech Talk gives a pretty nice
                    explanation on WSGI.)
                </p>
                <p>
                    The only real problem I see is that most Python web
                    developers don't know that they <em>can</em> ask the
                    questions that Paste is the answer to.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Also, while I don't know whether this WSGI middleware
                    business is exactly &quot;rocket science&quot;, I do think
                    that a lot of programmers don't really care about the stuff
                    WSGI and Paste (etc) solve. They should care, of course, but
                    they don't. (PHP is the ultimate proof of this. Not to say
                    that PHP is inherently evil, though.)

                    wow already 1.0 :) I just discovered Paste like 1 week ago
                </p>
                <p>
                    And I got tons of questions about it, is there a way to
                    contact you or a discussion forum about Paste ?

                        Yes, there's a mailing list:

                    How about a screencast? That might be better at explaining
                    how it works.

                    What I found most interesting about this page is that at the
                    time I looked at it there were four Google ads, all of them
                    related to Ruby on Rails (well, the first one was an
                    &quot;alternative to RoR&quot; (Java-based)). So, if anyone
                    clicks, Ian, you're making money off of the competition! :-)
