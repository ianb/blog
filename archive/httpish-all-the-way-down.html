                So what would a RESTish web framework look like? I don't see
                much point to focusing on PUT and DELETE or URI design, simply
                because it doesn't achieve anything new. That stuff can lead to
                non-browser architectures, which means that there will have to
                be an intermediary, and that intermediary will need a web
                framework, and the premise here is that we're thinking about web
                frameworks.
            </p>
            <p>
                Maybe it's better to just think about the goals of REST...
                loosely coupled, less code, decentralized, scalable, maybe even
                vague ideas like democratic, hackable, avoiding consulting-ware,
                less code, etc. etc. Small pieces.

                Hopefully useful. The architecture is interesting when thinking
                about them working in concert, not reflecting on the beauty of
                any one piece. Many of the pieces are incredibly boring, in
                fact. Tagging, okay, but a RESTful hash table? (Well, he's not
                the

                >
                -- but clearly it takes a bit of imagination to see the
                potential; the
                <a
                    class="reference"
                    href="http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/edu/ws-dw-ws-aws2.html"
                    >queue stuff Amazon is doing</a
                >
                is also pretty abstract.)
            </p>
            <p>
                What's interesting -- and hard -- is doing something with this
                mix. How will we keep the architecture manageable?
            </p>
            <p>
                The direction I've been focused on for a while now is how to use
                this style internally in an application. Because yes, you
                <em>may</em> want to move some RESTful piece of your app onto
                another server, onto another service, into another environment.
                But first you have to make something useful -- scaling tools is
                boring, and for most of us scalability isn't even the reason for
                REST. Only working web applications have to scale.
            </p>
            <p>
                So how can you handle a simple application (like, say, a blog)
                built from a dozen RESTful components? Lots of mod_rewrite
                rules, several startup scripts, some XML configuration, a couple
                app servers... oh just shoot me now. Setting up systems gets
                geometrically more annoying and error-prone as you add the
                number of systems working in concert. Probably half of why
                people like the ASP model is just because installation is so
                damned hard. You could just use S3 from the beginning... but I
                find that a non-starter as well, when the distributed hash table
                is just one piece among many. And then if you think about
                automated testing... ASP-only just isn't an option.
            </p>
            <p>
                But you can manage these pieces. That's what the
                <a
                    class="reference"
                    href="little-apps-instead-of-little-frameworks.html"
                    >small apps</a
                >
                post was about. And that's what the architecture of
                <a class="reference" href="http://pythonpaste.org">Paste</a> is
                about. I say the &quot;architecture&quot;, because Paste
                includes several <em>examples</em> of the kind of small
                application/component that you would use in this situation. By
                sticking to WSGI -- kind of an HTTP-in-Python -- any piece can
                be fully a peer, and Paste itself doesn't have a privileged
                position. A larger system of these kinds of components is in the
                works, like
                <a class="reference" href="http://beaker.groovie.org/"
                    >Beaker</a
                >
                for sessions and caching. For an example of how small an
                application might be, in Paste there's an application for
                sending a single file (<tt class="docutils literal"
                    ><span class="pre">paste.fileapp.FileApp</span></tt
                >), or an application for sending 404 messages (<tt
                    class="docutils literal"
                    ><span class="pre"
                        >httpexceptions.HTTPNotFound.wsgi_application</span
                    ></tt
                >). It sounds tedious, but those applications are as simple to
                invoke as they are to describe (at least once you have the WSGI
                invocation part down).
            </p>
            <p>
                In addition to these endpoints, there are lots of intermediaries
                that rely on the transparency of the request. These get called
                &quot;middleware&quot;... but ignore the terminology. An example
                is code that checks IP addresses against rules (<tt
                    class="docutils literal"
                    ><span class="pre">paste.auth.grantip</span></tt
                >), or validates HTML (<tt class="docutils literal"
                    ><span class="pre">paste.debug.wdg_validate</span></tt
                >). Intermediaries and end-point applications are even fuzzy --
                <tt class="docutils literal"
                    ><span class="pre">paste.auth.open_id</span></tt
                >
                does a little of both, annotating some requests and completely
                intercepting others (since
                <a class="reference" href="http://openid.net/">Open ID</a>
                logins span several requests). In the context of WSGI,
                authentication is <em>solved</em>. It goes in
                <tt class="docutils literal"
                    ><span class="pre">REMOTE_USER</span></tt
                >
                (recognizing the <em>standards we already have</em>, even if
                those standards are sometimes undervalued due to poor
                implementations in the past). How's
                <tt class="docutils literal"
                    ><span class="pre">REMOTE_USER</span></tt
                >
                get there? Out of scope! (Like REST, WSGI is as much about what
                it <em>doesn't</em> promise as what it does promise.)
            </p>
            <p>
                <a class="reference" href="http://pythonpaste.org/deploy/"
                    >Paste Deploy</a
                >
                is then a way to bring these pieces together and configure them,
                since a website will be built from a bunch of pieces. The actual
                invocation looks rather primitive, but the important part is
                that configuration is another syntax for Python function calls.
                So when you build a cohesive application from these pieces you
                put them all in a single process, build them at fixed locations.
                You don't configure them independently, instead you provide a
                cohesive single view of configuration, and programmatically
                configure the sub-pieces.
            </p>
            <p>
                Another issue with a highly granular REST stack is the HTTP
                overhead. This may be a case of premature optimization, but
                latency in particular is something that might bite you later.
                But because WSGI maps so closely to HTTP, you can make
                equivalent REST calls purely with WSGI and no network
                connection; this just turns into some function calls. Later on
                you can break it up, scale it out, configure pieces to be in
                different locations. If you need to... and you probably won't,
                and you may not know <em>which</em> pieces should be broken off
                to begin with.
            </p>
            <p>
                Anyway, that's why I think WSGI and Paste have some potential to
                work well with REST; not because they respect some idea of the
                purity of HTTP, but because they facilitate realistic
                architectures that are highly decoupled with HTTP (or
                looks-like-HTTP WSGI call) bringing those pieces together

                    Concur, this is the idea that finally made me buy into WSGI
                    a while back: lots of modular components talking (like) HTTP
                    up and down, perhaps minimally functional on their own or
                    just web-like intermediaries.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In a (yet another) small side project that will probably
                    never get beyond the barely functional prototype let alone
                    see the outside world, I'm experimenting with implementing a
                    REST-like interface to a relational database as a WSGI app,
                    outputting simplistic XHTML representations of the data
                    (rows/records), and then I have a minimal intermediary that
                    queries this app to combine/restrict datasets or follow link
                    references for parent-detail display. If I go much further
                    in splitting things out (separate apps for each relational
                    algebra operator?) I'll probably end up with a great example
                    of what NOT to do with WSGI, but it's liberating in some
                    ways.

                <p>
                    Definitely some mental mismatch at this point in doing all
                    subprocessing against the HTML output of upstream apps, but
                    the less extreme cases for compositing miniapps using WSGI
                    are completely right in my mind now.

                    Yeah, configuration/deployment and testing have been the
                    hardest problems I've come up against with this architecture
                    and ones that I don't feel like I have a good solution to
                    yet.

                <p>
                    The WSGI/Paste approach is interesting. Unfortunately, my
                    apps still need to work in a very heterogeneous environment
                    so if I put everything into just a WSGI stack, I lose the
                    ability to reuse it across languages as easily. Unified
                    configuration is tempting enough that I might go for it
                    sometime though.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The idea of building your app as a bunch of WSGI components
                    and later breaking them out into seperate REST apps as
                    needed has crossed my mind as well. My thought on it was to
                    go the other way though and have a library and registry that
                    abstracts the difference away. So you would build all your
                    components as WSGI components but call them through a fully
                    HTTP looking API. Then, there would be a registry somewhere
                    that knows which urls map to actual seperate applications
                    and which can be silently converted to WSGI calls. So you do
                    something like:
                </p>
                <pre class="literal-block">
from magic_REST_WSGI_library import GET
tags = GET(&quot;http://tasty.example.com/item/foo/&quot;)
</pre
                >
                <p>
                    and a registry that magic_REST_WSGI_library reads knows that
                    &quot;tasty.example.com&quot; can really be mapped to a WSGI
                    component and called in process. That way, when that
                    component does need to be moved out to its own machine or
                    written in a different language or something, no code has to
                    be changed; just an update to the registry telling it that
                    requests to that service now have to be proper HTTP
                    requests. It's sort of a &quot;have your cake and eat it
                    too&quot; approach. You get the flexibility and loose
                    coupling of REST components but, if you happen to write all
                    your components in python and keep them WSGI compatible, you
                    can keep the performance and centralized configuration of
                    having them all in-process. Maybe this is something that
                    Paste could help with.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The other observation I have on performance of applications
                    built up out of small REST applications is that asynchronous
                    requests are your friend. Latency does add up quickly and
                    the way to avoid it is to avoid synchronous communication
                    any time you can. Looking at how Erlang applications are
                    structured is advisable.

                        The WSGI/Paste approach is interesting. Unfortunately,
                        my apps still need to work in a very heterogeneous
                        environment so if I put everything into just a WSGI
                        stack, I lose the ability to reuse it across languages
                        as easily. Unified configuration is tempting enough that
                        I might go for it sometime though.

                        You'd still be making HTTPish calls between
                        applications. WSGI (and even Paste) doesn't relate to
                        that; it just makes it more manageable when you have a
                        bunch of WSGI/Paste pieces. Well, WSGI does give you a
                        backdoor to make requests on behalf of the original
                        user, since it has a slightly larger concept of a
                        request than what can be embedded in HTTP, including
                        things like trusted attributes (keys that don't start
                        with
                        <tt class="docutils literal"
                            ><span class="pre">HTTP_</span></tt
                        >).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Of course, you can opt not to use these things and stick
                        to what can be represented in HTTP. But it can be very
                        tempting.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        And of course, middleware is breaking out of what HTTP
                        can give you. Though it'd be neat if you could run PHP
                        with FastCGI under a WSGI stack.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Anyway, there's nothing stopping you from sticking to
                        language-neutral constructs when using WSGI, and when
                        WSGI-specific constructs get used it's fairly explicit
                        so you know what you are getting into.

                        The idea of building your app as a bunch of WSGI
                        components and later breaking them out into seperate
                        REST apps as needed has crossed my mind as well. My
                        thought on it was to go the other way though and have a
                        library and registry that abstracts the difference away.
                        So you would build all your components as WSGI
                        components but call them through a fully HTTP looking
                        API. Then, there would be a registry somewhere that
                        knows which urls map to actual seperate applications and
                        which can be silently converted to WSGI calls.

                        For something that requires less configuration and is

                        offers a model where you phrase it as a WSGI request. By
                        adding to that, you could translate the request into an
                        actual HTTP request if it was outside of the WSGI stack.
                        paste.recursive isn't exactly the right match (and
                        <a
                            class="reference"

                        >
                        isn't exactly right for making a WSGI request into an
                        HTTP request), but it would be very close to that. You
                        wouldn't need configuration, because by keeping note of
                        the request on the way in you can automatically
                        determine where the root of the WSGI server is. Though
                        it could be tricky if you have fancy dispatching, like
                        virtual host dispatching, which means that the server is
                        capable of internally responding to more requests than
                        you might think.

                        I like the idea of using callbacks more, though I
                        haven't tried it in practice. Something like &quot;do
                        this, then when you are done POST to this URL with the
                        results&quot;. Of course, many UIs need synchronous
                        actions (people like to know that when they do something
                        it is actually done), so you can't solve all latency
                        problems this way.

                    It's some what off-topic, but I've been trying to figure out
                    how to do simple, RESTful, yet secure authentication for
                    xmlrpc.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Take, for example, the Blogger API. Sends passwords via
                    plaintext for each API hit. RESTful, but not secure. You can
                    make it more secure with a back-and-forth digest
                    authentication model, but then it's not really RESTful.
                </p>

                    FWIW, the RESTful hashtable (pita) is pretty handy for
                    building stateful flash apps - that is, thicker clients that
                    want to be able to save/load, and just stash their per-user
                    state someplace. Slap on some standard metadata,
                    authentication policy, and data-pocket mgmt and you have
                    yourself a really useful mini-app.

                    No, this would not be used for lots and lots of frequent
                    hashtable lookups within a program.
