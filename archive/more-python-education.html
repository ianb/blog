                    It's interesting how much Python is coming up in the notes;
                    not that it's surprising given the people there. But that
                    Alan Kay seems so open to Python is a bit surprising.

                    The more I think about Hypercard, the browser, and
                    programming in general, the more the idea

            <p>I noticed this:</p>
            <blockquote>
                Momentum seems to be building for a stronger graphics engine,
                either 2D or 3D, with Python bindings, that'll run interactively
                from within a browser. The Squeak folks may be willing to
                contribute to this effort. Guido feels we'll need to recruit new
                talent for this, as the Python community is currently pretty
                maxed out on projects. Should such an engine be developed,
                turtle stuff would be incorporated therein.
            </blockquote>
            <p>
                I'm a bit surprised -- Python graphics doesn't seem to be in bad
                shape, what with Pygame, VPython, and other projects.
            </p>
            <p>
                As a <em>plugin</em>, perhaps there's nothing in Python to use.
                I don't get the plugin thing. Plugins seem totally irrelevant
                now. Maybe Logo written in ActionScript (the Flash
                Javascript-a-like), or Flash as an output medium... but
                introducing another plugin seems pointless. It's just putting a
                normal GUI app inside a browser window, which is like the worst
                of all worlds.
            </p>
            <p>
                Mozilla + XPCOM + Python + Canvas/SVG... that seems like a
                usable combination. But not for the ability to distribute --
                unless you also offered a server-side programming alternative
                where graphics were pushed out to the browser, instead of
                generated in-process to the browser.
            </p>
            <p>
                Honestly, I just don't think fancy graphics are important.
                Graphics of some sort? Sure, but I don't think the graphics have
                to be top of the line. Other issues are far more important, and
                the graphics technique should be chosen based on those other
                issues. Things like how the development environment feels.

                    There should be transparent version control; everytime you
                    run the program, a checkin transparently happens first. Give
                    a movie of the development, or when something fails show
                    exactly what was changed since the last time the program
                    worked.

                <li>
                    Avoiding &quot;save&quot; would be nice too. I think saving
                    is dumb in general. It's used as a really really stupid form
                    of version control
                    (<em>revert-to-thing-I-haven't-saved-over</em>). Maybe avoid
                    files.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Great debugging tools. Visualization tools. See the program
                    execute in a concrete manner. Error messages that are
                    meaningful, contextual, and guiding.

                    Insulate the child from the underlying system, at least to
                    start. You want them to be able to open it up, but only when
                    they are ready to (<em>but</em>: let them choose when they
                    are ready for themselves.)
                </li>
                <li>
                    Internationalize the language itself. Logo does this all the
                    time (eased by its highly limited number of special
                    syntactic forms), but it's otherwise pretty unusual. Though
                    it becomes really hard to open the hood. Well damn... I
                    guess they should all just learn English. Really.

                <li>
                    Make programming approachable for students with different
                    skills. &quot;Real&quot; programmers are self-selected for
                    certain abilities to abstract. I suspect that the ability
                    for us to look at source and just intuitively understand its
                    basic lexical structure is one of those selections. More
                    hints and tools for people who don't get that. More explicit
                    visual representations (like in
                    <a
                        class="reference"

                        >Boxer</a
                    >). A narrative form would be nice, but I can't think of
                    what it would look like.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Make sure students can share everything they do, at least
                    with each other. Really encourage shared libraries among
                    students. There's huge learning potential in that, and given
                    the right tools I'm confident that shared libraries will
                    emerge in classrooms. Once the classroom dissolves in the
                    beginning of another year, start with a blank slate for the
                    next class, but also let every student take that class's
                    code with them.

                (you must appreciate that link in the absurdity of its
                sentiment, otherwise it might seem mean). And yet art or not, it
                makes kids happy to draw. It's the process, not the product, and
                if adults and teachers can figure that out, the kids will be
                totally comfortable working that way. That's what kids do.

                    AppleScript had an experimental (never released) i18n
                    functionality. Like Hypertalk, the language is
                    pseudo-English with fairly regular syntax, so you could
                    write a script in English, send the bytecode to someone in
                    Japan, and the other person could open the script with the
                    syntax (although not the variables) localized to Japanese
                    automatically.

                    I don't think Python graphics are nearly easy enough to use.
                    Anything geared towards beginners is going to have to start
                    at a much higher level. A good IDE a la Hypercard is
                    critical.

                        Ease of use is a separate matter. The raw material is

                    As someone who learned to program with Python, I would like
                    to offer a counterview.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Essentially that minimilism is essential. And a sense of
                    direct, unmediated, transparent contact with underlying
                    mechanisms. The Python prompt is an example of that kind of
                    environment.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This is true I think partly on cognitive grounds, but also
                    partly on motivational grounds. I am motivated to learn to
                    program to gain independance from others' notions of how
                    things need to be - otherwise I might go about the business
                    of being a happy Windows user. A heavy IDE leaves me
                    confused about what is possible from outside of it - from
                    day one.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Before coming to Python I had found Scheme via the DrScheme
                    project - and found myself confused from the beginning as to
                    what was the environment and what was the programming
                    language. And moved on.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In finding Python, a generic text editor and the raw prompt
                    I find what - for me - was the right environment.
                </p>
                <p>
                    And I think the most important point - the progress was not
                    only immediate, but has been sustained.
                </p>
                <p>I like your reference to childrens' drawings.</p>
                <p>
                    We should not be concerned with the sophistication of the
                    output - which is what I think the heavy IDE aided approach
                    seems too often to focus upon. Teaching children or anyone
                    else that is what is important at the initial stages is the
                    output, rather than the process, is misleading them. And
                    children - in particular - are intuitive enough to know when
                    they are being mislead. If we can't find a way to introduce
                    children to programming without misleading them - and I seem
                    to be open to that possiblity that this is true more than
                    many others - perhaps we should simply wait until they are
                    developed, cognititively, to the point where we can.
                </p>
                <p>Why start a process in a way that is not sustainable.</p>
                <p>
                    What does the environment teach us really about the most
                    important aspect of becoming a programmer in any meaningful
                    sense - i.e., working independantly of large sets of
                    mysterious depedencies. Most IDEs for beginning programmers
                    are not only neutral, but I think counterproduct on this
                    point - introducing programming as another form of
                    dependency, rather than as the kind of liberating acitivity
                    it should be understood, from the beginning, to be. And I
                    think needs to be, if interest in it is to be sustained.

                    I started programming 26 years ago, and the first program I
                    wrote was a little tank twirling in different directions and
                    prowling around the screen: I got such a buzz from that
                    experience, I'll NEVER forget it: I was hooked, excited and
                    motivated to learn more (I've been programming ever since) -
                    for me the graphical element was crucial (I was 14 at the
                    time), so I can fully understand the Logo-like mindset of
                    including simple graphics as a learning tool.
                </p>
                <p>
                    That first language was Basic, and since, I've used
                    C/C++/Java/Perl/Assembler (and a few others) for work, but
                    until I came across Python (about 6/7 years ago), I didn't
                    really ENJOY programming like I did at the start. Python
                    gave me that buzz because it let me DO THINGS, and do them
                    quickly and easily (much as I could with those original 8k
                    BASIC interpreters and a few peeks and pokes).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now, to get back more to the topic of graphics: over the
                    last few years, I've been re-visiting graphics, using Python
                    of course, on the web (SVG/CSS) and locally using Tk;
                    AnyGui; PyGame; WxPython. Anygui was my favourite project as
                    it abstracted the details, but, as we know, it didn't get
                    completed. However, my experiments with this and PyGame and
                    wx all lead me to the conclusion that it would be incredibly
                    useful to have a REALLY SIMPLE graphics capability
                    accessible from the python standard library. Now, I don't
                    want a simple wrapper around existing libraries as they all
                    seem to require a little too much boilerplate code to do
                    simple things: what we need is something a lot more akin to
                    Logo, but perhaps updated to allow more complex, modern
                    graphics. I'm not sure of the exact form that this might
                    take (although PyGame goes some way towards providing the
                    capability), but I, for one, agree that it should be done.
                </p>
                <p>
                    P.S. I'm a Vim/command line guy and never use an IDE if I
                    can avoid it, but I have found Eclipse useful for Java
                    coding, and I also agree that a usable IDE is important for
                    approachability (if only to avoid typing pydoc -g :)

                        Graphics are motivational and the feedback loop of code
                        to graphics has been important for me.
                    </p>
                    <p>An IDE has not been.</p>
                    <p>
                        I also am in agreement as to the fact that it would be
                        wonderful to have some high potency graphical
                        capabilities within the Python standard distribution.

                    <p>The most likely candidate might be VPython:</p>

                    <p>
                        I think it is in the right spirit and has the kind of
                        small footprint that would make it appropriate as a
                        battery included. I think the main push back is
                        crossplatform issues - it has some fairly exotic
                        dependencies on Linux, does not run natively on Mac, and
                        the more exotic OS's I would suspect might be even more
                        problematic.

                    Just as a note, pygame has already been used in education a
                    bit. Here are some details.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It has been taught to 9-12 year olds by a person I met at a
                    community learning center.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Also, I did a set of 'lectures' for an online teaching
                    website teaching python using pygame.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There is also a book in development which uses a very logo
                    like style. Pysgear is also built on top of pygame.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There has also been university level courses which teach
                    pygame.

                        It will be nice if and when we can get to the point of
                        talking about what has been <em>effective</em> rather
                        than what ahs been <em>used</em>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        And what has been effective has to be measured against
                        defined goals - a subject about which there is a lot of
                        confusion, and I think sometimes almost intentional
                        ambiguity.
                    </p>
                    <p>As Ian say about Logo:</p>
                    <p>
                        &quot;&quot;&quot; It's important to remember that this
                        is not about teaching programming. It's about teaching
                        math, or abstraction, or debugging. &quot;&quot;&quot;
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        That's pretty vague stuff, IMO. What kind of math? What
                        kinds of &quot;abstraction&quot;? In what way is this
                        more powerful than non computer-aided approaches for a
                        given age group? What age groups are we talking about?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Personally I can't live with these ambiguities within
                        the context of discussions as dire as the issue of
                        educationa and children. Too undisciplined and too much
                        room for the geeks to justify a geek-centric view of the
                        domain.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        So I am very much off the Kay bus, and make no bones
                        about it.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        And I don't actually believe that Kay has an interest in
                        Python - at least the Python we know and love. I think
                        his interest is in the energy of the Python community.
                        Hopefully that energy remains focused on developing and
                        eveolving its own approaches, rather than adapting and
                        porting those from other domains and communities.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        And I think that means evolving narrower curriculums
                        with clearly defined goals - the Software Carpentry
                        project, the physics curriculums related to Vpython, etc
                        and etc. No Big Idea. Lots of big ideas.

                            You seem to have a chip on your shoulder about Alan
                            Kay. Why is that? Really; since he doesn't have a
                            blog or anything, much of what I can infer of his
                            intentions is highly indirect. And I've become
                            addicted to primary sources, so indirect reports are
                            highly unsatisfying. So I'm curious what exactly you
                            are reacting against in his work or ideas.

                                what our intent should be about children and

                                addressed can - at this stage - only be
                                approached with a sense of humility. There are
                                many who for example believe that exposure of
                                children to computers as a learning mechanism is
                                not simply overstated, but is fact actively
                                harmful. My mind is open to the possibility that

                                Bottom line is that Kay consistently seems to me
                                to fail the humility test, where that is the
                                most meaningful test to pass in this domain at
                                this time, in my view.

                            There are too many varied and wide goals for
                            everyone to focus on them.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The pygame goal is to make games programming easier.
                            So people don't need C or C++ to do games. 'Takes
                            the &quot;C++&quot; out of &quot;Game
                            Development&quot;' It's amazing how many people are
                            able to make some sort of game that could never
                            finish anything with C/C++.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            So pygame and python allow more people to do
                            something fun with programming. I think programming
                            is a useful skill to have. So teaching programming
                            through games making is a fun way to teach
                            something. People who are interested in something
                            are more likely to learn it.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I think games programmers are often the least
                            geeky/nerdy programmer types around. By that I mean,
                            they are often more socially able. I think this is
                            because games programmers are drawn to it for
                            different reasons than other types of programmers.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Music, and games programming goes together often
                            too. People interested in music programming often
                            gravitate to python for its ease of use. However I
                            think python is a little limited at the moment for
                            audio programming. However python-gst, and pymedia
                            are getting closer to allowing complicated things.
                            The 'Processing' smalltalk like language is where it
                            is at for audio ease of use at the moment.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I like the 'mathematician in the street' quote from
                            your web page... a friend of mine is doing a comedy
                            show about teaching maths in a less nerdy way right
                            now.

                    I'm frustrated by a growing trend to look back at what has
                    been done and try to recreate it instead of creating
                    something new through innovation alone. I'm writting in
                    regards to LOGO. Yes, many of us grew up learning logo as
                    our first language. I remember the C64 lab in gradeschool
                    where we would spend 45 minutes at a time staring at that
                    triangular turtle on the screen.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It was a different day back then. LOGO was actually advanced
                    for what the hardware could do, it was designed around how
                    graphics were processed, and Lisp was prehaps the best
                    language of the day.

                    Newer hardware has some great 3d capabilities. Utilizing
                    them for education is something for modern-day innovation.

                    RE: Python 3d, I'm a developer with the Soya3d project
                    (www.soya3d.org). We've got an awesome OO 3d frameworking
                    going that's under-utilized by the Python community.
                    Definetly worth checking out.

                    Although I expect there's ample links and discussion at
                    EDU-SIG list, I still feel compelled to link an gratuitous
