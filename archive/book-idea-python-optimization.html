        <h1>Book Idea: Python Optimization</h1>
        <p>
            Every so often it seems like some Python figure thinks about writing
            a book, but they aren't sure what to write about. So, for anyone
            like that, here's an idea for the taking: Python optimization. It
            seems like it has a fairly narrow scope, but I think there's
            actually a lot of material there. Here's some things I can think of:
        </p>

        <ol>
            <li>Profiling, where all optimization should start.</li>
            <li>
                In-python optimizations:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Caching (this is where I always start). Also pooling.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Factoring applications into long-running processes, when
                        startup times are a problem. Also tips like lazy loading
                        of code.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        Other tricks to speed startup time. I understand things
                        like the search path can significantly effect some of
                        this.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        Streaming... I feel like there's a term I am missing
                        here. Like the difference between SAX XML parsing and
                        DOM, where SAX encourages the programmer to do all the
                        work possible as the document is being parsed, while DOM
                        typically does all the parsing up front. That's one
                        example of a larger concept, and one that dramatically
                        effects performance.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        Note important modules that may be forgotten. E.g.,
                        <a
                            href="http://python.org/doc/current/lib/module-StringIO.html"
                            ><tt>StringIO</tt></a
                        >
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Lots of little tips, e.g.,
                        <tt>lst.sort(); lst.reverse()</tt> instead of
                        <tt>lst.sort(lambda a, b: cmp(b, a))</tt>.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>

            <li>
                Numeric and related modules. There's a lot of novel ways of
                using these tools outside of their core domain.
            </li>

            <li>Pyrex.</li>
            <li>
                Extensions in C, thinking particularly about those inner loops.
                I think this subject could remain fairly tight as long as you
                are focused on optimization, rather than the entire subject of
                programming C Python extensions.
            </li>

            <li>
                Psyco. It's kind of magic, so it might be hard to talk about,
                but there is some important information about how it works.
            </li>

            <li>
                Microthreads. There's a lot of flavors and ideas out there, some
                built on generators, some not. Perhaps some talk of Stackless,
                or Greenlets (the mysterious new kid on the block).
            </li>

            <li>
                Asynchronous programming. This is a big topic, but at least
                there should be a discussion of the performance characteristics,
                and enough information to get a feel.
            </li>

            <li>
                XML parsing. It seems very specific, but there's a bunch of
                alternatives, and performance can be a significant issue.
            </li>

            <li>
                GUI programming, particularly techniques to make a GUI
                responsive. This might be difficult to address without covering
                GUI programming as a whole, so maybe this wouldn't work.
            </li>
        </ol>

        I'm sure there's things I'm not thinking of, and there's a lot of
        research that would go into it. I think the result could be a really
        good book, though, with something for every level. Like a Python
        Cookbook, only more specific. There's a fair amount of competition among
        generic Python books, so specific topics seem to have more potential. It
        could also be quite popular; it's something that would catch the eye of
        even non-Python programmers, as there's many people who want to use
        Python, but are concerned about the performance. I think that concern is
        often misplaced, but it's there nonetheless. Performance is also
        exciting to people, in the way that gets people to buy books.

        <p>Anyway, there's my idea, maybe it'll be helpful to someone.</p>

            Here's another idea: "Design and Interpretation of Runtime Systems".
            Every computer science department on the planet offers a course on
            compilers, but how many offer a course on the theory and practice of
            what you have to do at runtime? Linking and loading, byte-code
            interpreters, just-in-time compilation---there's a lot there, but
            no-one has ever written it all down in one place.
            <br />

            <br />
            I think Python would be an running example for such a book, if one
            included Psyco, IronPython, etc.

            An optimization book would be great. Many people who use Python have
            rich programming backgrounds and can transfer universal optimization
            concepts like caching and pooling to Python. However I believe for a
            significant number of Python users that Python is a first or at most
            second language. This group doesn't have the benefit of lessons
            learned after years of programming in C, Java, or Perl to apply to
            optimizing Python programs.

            Rather than a dead trees book, how about a wikipedia-like public
            repository, with many contributors?
