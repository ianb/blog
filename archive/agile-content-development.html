</div><h1>Agile Content Development</h1>
 
<div class="document">
<p>I was going to comment on <a class="reference" href="http://faassen.n--tree.net/blog/view/weblog/2005/12/15/0">Martijn Faasen's</a> reply to
<a class="reference" href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0116506/2005/12/15.html#a380">Paul Everitt's</a> reflection
on <a class="reference" href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0116506/2005/12/15.html#a380">agile content</a>, and then it
turned into this post-sized thing...</p>
<p>To recap: Paul thinks that there was something really great about
Zope's through-the-web (TTW) development, that it brought in content
developers to the development process and facilitated a sort of agile
practice on the part of those content developers.  Underlying that is
a critique of the move in Zope 3 (and even in later Zope 2
developments) towards components, and towards a programmer-centric
model.  Martijn's
reply is that maybe TTW was a nice idea, but it was unmaintainable,
and that programmers and sysadmins have certain requirements that
Zope/ZODB development didn't fulfill.</p>
<p>I'd counter that content requires just as much discipline to manage
well as code does; TTW didn't serve programmers well, but its actual
implementation can't serve content developers well in the long term
either.  As programmers we've developed lots of techniques to manage
our code; these happen to be filesystem-based, and thus unavailable to
ZODB-based code.  But more importantly is just that they <em>exist</em>.
They didn't and don't exist in a reliable way for TTW (Zope)
development.  Instead of bringing programmers into the underpowered
TTW world, it would have been better the processes that programmers
use to content developers.</p>
<p><em>Every</em> feature that source control systems have is applicable to
content.  Merging, branching, conflicts, tags... they all have meaning
there, and with a little education I believe that that content
developers can appreciate the purpose as much as programmers.  (Those
processes don't come naturally, to programmers or content developers,
but I think it is clear that they are worth learning.)
And reading Paul's post, it occurs to me that many version control
systems are actually very sloppy in a lot of ways.  They record
changes, but they don't check your syntax, and they generally don't
apply any external policies or workflow.  (Interestingly Zope <em>does</em>
check your DTML syntax and won't save bad files; this is annoying in
practice.)  Version control systems generally work on flat files which
they don't interpret in any way.  That's the kind of underlying
infrastructure that makes for a flexible, developer-friendly
environment that Paul is talking about; flat files aren't a complete
interface, but they provide the kind of flexibility that facilitates agile
workflows and tools.</p>
<p>And maybe it's useful to note that this sloppiness is true of open
source version control systems in particular; true of the things
programmers build for themselves, without the misplaced
micromanagement that proprietary systems find themselves catering to.</p>
<p>The parallel to CMSs is fairly obvious; it's not programmers that make
a CMS into a labyrinth of creativity-crushing exercises, it's the
blasted managers who drive the CMS vendors to implement misguided
features.  Paul's rather minor dig at component development is much
less central to his thesis than the larger dig at managers and the typical
CMS design.</p>
<p>The open source aspect is interesting too.  When we build tools for
ourselves, we build good tools with which we won't piss ourselves off.
(Well, often we piss ourselves off, but we then we keep rewriting
those tools until we feel better.)  Unfortunately, it's hard for
content developers to make their own tools in the ways that
programmers do; it's even harder for them to rewrite and reform those
tools.  Paul is wishing they could; Martijn knows that in
practice it doesn't work just out of desire.</p>
<p>But authors can build good tools in some way; I think people are trying to build
the infrastructure for these things right now under a variety of names.  I think that's what
<a class="reference" href="http://www.jot.com/">Jotspot</a> is about, what <a class="reference" href="http://infogami.com/">Aaron Swartz's startup</a> is trying to do, and lots of other efforts
too, direct and indirect.  Blogging software reinvigorated simple content development, but
it did so without any tools for building tools, without any real
user-accessible extension mechanisms; but this next round of software
might be changing that.</p>

<p>The managers of the CMS vendors, or the managers at their clients? I can assure you that awful clients can muddy the cleanest application, especially if they are know-it-alls.</p>

<p>Yes, I mean the managers at the client, who want the tool to embody all sorts of policies and controls they think they should have, but aren't actually willing to implement in their own non-computer processes.</p>
