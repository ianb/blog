                Quite some time ago, Daniel Savard wrote an extension to
                SQLObject to allow something closer to traditional inheritance.
                SQLObject already

                    >supports inheritance</a
                >, but it's not what people typically expect, because it just
                clones a table instead of creating something that looks like a
                subtable. You can read
                <a
                    class="reference"
                    href="http://svn.colorstudy.com/home/phd/SQLObject/inheritance/docs/Inheritance.txt"
                    >the description</a

                of the patch for the details.
            </p>
            <p>
                I've meant to respond to the patch for a long time, but I
                couldn't quite put my finger on what troubled me about it. But
                I've kind of decided: SQLObject isn't a way to persist your
                objects in a database. It's not an object-&gt;relational
                database mapper. It's a relational-&gt;object mapper, a way to
                model your relational database as objects. You aren't meant to
                forget there's a database. It isn't magical, it isn't
                transparent, and I don't want it to be. If you want transparent,
                use the
                <a class="reference" href="http://zope.org/Wikis/ZODB/FrontPage"
                    >ZODB</a
                >, that's what it's meant for. Or use something like
                <a class="reference" href="http://hathawaymix.org/Software/Ape"
                    >APE</a
                >
                or
                <a
                    class="reference"
                    href="http://pyds.muensterland.org/weblog/2004/12/12.html#P244"
                    >Active Storage</a
                >
                if you want a RDBMS backend to a object database. An RDBMS is a
                viable backend for that kind of work, but the result shouldn't
                be confused with relational modeling.
            </p>
            <p>
                I think people should use an RDBMS for its advantages, and there
                are quite a few advantages. Being object oriented isn't one of
                them. It's probably not surprising that object oriented
                extensions to RDBMS systems aren't that popular. PostgreSQL has
                several such extensions, but I've never used them, nor seen them
                used in any project I've worked on. They seem like a novelty, an
                idea that seemed useful but didn't pan out. So I'd rather avoid
                the whole thing in SQLObject; certainly there is a lot of room
                for improvement where SQLObject could better model relations,
                but inheritance isn't one of them.

                    Spot on, as usual, Ian. You've summed up my philosophy on
                    persistence much more elegantly and succintly than I have
                    ever done.

                    Ian, I'm an amature SQLObject user and I generally agree
                    with what you're saying, but I would add that in the case of
                    subclasses, it would be nice if the supeclass could find
                    subclass instances. Say, for instance, I have this kind of
                    structure:
                </p>
                <dl>
                    <dt>class Server(SQLObject):</dt>
                    <dd>...</dd>
                    <dt>class NameServer(Server):</dt>
                    <dd>...</dd>
                    <dt>class WebServer(Server):</dt>
                    <dd>...</dd>
                    <dt>class FileServer(Server):</dt>
                    <dd>...</dd>
                </dl>
                <p>
                    Although the relational way to do this may be to structure
                    one server table with server-type as a foreign key, if
                    you're overloading your SQLObjects with methods appropriate
                    for various kinds of servers, that kind of structure can be
                    inconvenient:
                </p>
                <dl>
                    <dt>class FileServer(Server):</dt>
                    <dd>
                        <dl class="first last">
                            <dt>def storeFile(...):</dt>
                            <dd>...</dd>
                        </dl>
                    </dd>
                </dl>
                <p>
                    The way SQLObject creates tables for this makes sense, it's
                    a poor relational model and if I want a way to grab
                    <em>all</em> Server objects based on some criteria, it's
                    troublesome. Of course, you can break up your model into
                    smaller subclasses and tables, but in doing so I think you
                    tend to lose what makes SQLObject so great, its simplicity
                    and the resultingly simple models.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Having said all that, I'm not sure what the solution is or
                    whether I think subtables are a good idea. It's been a while
                    since I tinkered with PostgreSQL's Object-Relational
                    notions, but I remember them being quite limited. Is there a
                    way you could add some methods to superclasses for gathering
                    subclass objects?

                        table could indicate the ID and table name that contains
                        other information (i.e., DNS, web, or file information).
                        There's also other ways to handle this relationally.
                        Some of those techniques will require enhancements to
                        SQLObject (though many of them are quite reasonable to
                        implement in an ad hoc manner).
