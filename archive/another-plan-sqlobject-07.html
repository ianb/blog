</div><h1>Another plan: SQLObject 0.7</h1>
 
<div class="document">
<p>A while ago I wrote some thoughts on what <a class="reference" href="http://sqlobject.org">SQLObject</a> 0.6 <a class="reference" href="sqlobject-api-redesign.html">might look
like</a>.  Well, a lot of those things didn't happen (actually nearly
all of them), though the plans were pretty speculative so it's no
surprise it didn't happen.  But I'm going through another set of
refactoring for SQLObject 0.7 (and I'm already part way through it) so
I can say better what will happen for that version.</p>
<div class="section">
<h1><a id="inheritance" name="inheritance">Inheritance</a></h1>
<p>SQLObject normally implements <a class="reference" href="http://www.martinfowler.com/eaaCatalog/concreteTableInheritance.html">concrete table inheritance</a>, mostly
because that was the absolute minimum I could do so that it support
any kind of inheritance at all.  It was the best I could do to avoid
the issue.</p>
<p>But some people like other kinds of inheritance.  Daniel Savard
implemented a patch to add another kind of inheritance, kind of like
<a class="reference" href="http://www.martinfowler.com/eaaCatalog/classTableInheritance.html">class table inheritance</a> -- except that each row is actually typed
as part of the most-parent-table.</p>
<p>Oleg Broytmann took over the patch, and after refactoring it a bit
it's now part of SQLObject.  You have to subclass from
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">InheritableSQLObject</span></tt> to actually use this kind of inheritance (I
still couldn't bear bringing this into the main class -- I just don't
like imposing object-oriented concepts on a relational database).</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h1><a id="extra-table-information" name="extra-table-information">Extra Table Information</a></h1>
<p>First, I'll be implementing <a class="reference" href="http://blog.ianbicking.org/sqlobject-api-redesign.html?#extra-table-information">extra table information</a>, pretty much in
the way I described.  This is already well along in the <a class="reference" href="http://svn.colorstudy.com/trunk/SQLObject">repository</a>,
and looks like:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
class MyTable(SQLObject):
    class sqlmeta:
        table = 'my_funny_table_name'
        style = MixedCaseStyle()
    col = StringCol()
    ...
</pre>
<p>So every subclass of <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">SQLObject</span></tt> gets its own <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">sqlmeta</span></tt> class.
They are buddy classes, with a separate <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">sqlmeta</span></tt> subclass (always
with the same name) for each <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">SQLObject</span></tt> subclass.  And they are
buddy instances too -- <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">anInstance.sqlmeta</span></tt> is an instance of
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">ATable.sqlmeta</span></tt>.  Confusing?  Hopefully not, I think it makes sense
when you are using it.</p>
<p>This <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">sqlmeta</span></tt> class/instance/attribute will hold much of the public
API for SQLObject.  Your extensions will add custom methods and
attributes (/columns) to the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">SQLObject</span></tt> subclass, but that class
will be pretty much yours and yours alone, as all the SQLObject
accounting is being moved to <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">sqlmeta</span></tt>.</p>
<p>With this we'll finally add stable, documented APIs for all sorts of
introspection, like listing all the columns in a table.</p>
<p>Backward compatibility is being maintained, with settings to control
how many warnings you want to get about using the old style of class
definitions and attributes.  By default there will be lots of
warnings, so people new to SQLObject who are working off older
documentation will be alerted to the new style early on.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h1><a id="simplified-metaclass" name="simplified-metaclass">Simplified Metaclass</a></h1>
<p>SQLObject now uses a very simple metaclass:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
class DeclarativeMeta(type):

    def __new__(meta, class_name, bases, new_attrs):
        cls = type.__new__(meta, class_name, bases, new_attrs)
        if new_attrs.has_key('__classinit__'):
            cls.__classinit__ = staticmethod(cls.__classinit__.im_func)
        cls.__classinit__(cls, new_attrs)
        return cls
</pre>
<p>This is along the lines of <a class="reference" href="a-conservative-metaclass.html">a conservative metaclass</a>, and all the
interesting logic is in <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">SQLObject.__classinit__</span></tt> (a method which I
am also trying to whittle down).  Hopefully this will make the code
seem more accessible -- while it doesn't change much, it simplifies
something that many people find intimidating (metaclasses) and moves
the bulk of that logic into a much simpler method (<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">__classinit__</span></tt>).</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h1><a id="active-attributes" name="active-attributes">Active Attributes</a></h1>
<p>Along the lines of <a class="reference" href="descriptor-nit.html">what I proposed for setonce</a> earlier,
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">__classinit__</span></tt> will check for &quot;magic attributes&quot;.  Right now it
looks specifically for subclasses of <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Col</span></tt> (which are column
descriptions) and a couple other special classes.  After this change
it will look for a special method on attributes: <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">__addtoclass__</span></tt>,
and calls that method with the class the attribute is being bound to,
and the name it is being given.  That method can replace the
attribute.  It gets a <em>little</em> complicated, because we usually replace
the original object with one that is closely tied to the class it is
being bound to -- this way the original object can be reused -- but it
really comes down to a fairly simple
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">soClass.addColumn(attributeWeJustCreated)</span></tt>.</p>
<p>This will be something that other people can use to extend SQLObject.
For instance, there's more kinds of joins, like a situation where two
tables are related with some string indicating the type of relation
(e.g., a person might be related to an object as an owner, author,
watcher, etc).  I think these active attributes will be easy to write,
and allow people to express some of the things they want to express
without adding too many ideas and policies into SQLObject itself.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h1><a id="descriptors" name="descriptors">Descriptors</a></h1>
<p>As well as becoming active attributes, column objects will become
<a class="reference" href="http://users.rcn.com/python/download/Descriptor.htm">descriptors</a>.  This means <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">property</span></tt> will be used less, and the
dynamically-created <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">lambdas</span></tt> will also go away (they are now just
being created with <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">eval()</span></tt>, a bit of a bad smell).</p>
<p>The current way of overriding getters and setters (by defining
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">_get_columnName</span></tt> and <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">_set_columnName</span></tt>) will go away, and instead
you'll be able to add methods to the column descriptors.  These
methods will be a bit easier to understand and use.</p>
<p>Descriptors will also do double-duty as <a class="reference" href="http://svn.colorstudy.com/trunk/SQLObject/sqlobject/sqlbuilder.py">sqlbuilder</a> objects, so you
don't have to use <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">MyTable.q.column</span></tt> in queries, instead you can
just use <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">MyTable.column</span></tt>.</p>
<p>I also plan to add hooks for various events, like when a row is
created, updated, or deleted.  So maybe a you could implement
something where a row was always updated to indicate the last time the
row was editor.  Or <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">CASCADE</span></tt> could be implemented as a hook on the
delete event for <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">ForeignKey</span></tt>.</p>
<p>This last stuff might not make it into 0.7; I'm still working on the
active attributes, and some form of descriptor should happen, but the
events might be a stretch.</p>
<p>Anyway, that's the plan I have now, if you are curious about where
SQLObject is going.</p>

<p>That's something I've been trying to finagle into the object layer in my ORM lately. The descriptors are great for firing triggers when <em>each</em> value is modified, but not useful for parallel triggers. For example, if you have, oh... let's say a project-management webapp, you want to send a notification to the project manager when a due date is changed. What happens when both the due date and the owner are changed within the same submission? Ideally, there'd be a way to do the updates first and fire any triggers second (that doesn't require the UI developer to manually serialize). I haven't yet found a good idiom for that.</p>
<p>Of course, the &quot;last time edited&quot; could be handled when you flush the objects at the end of the request, but there are many more complicated interactions I've been running into lately...I'd be interested to hear your opinions.</p>

I wouldn't think it'd be hard, but seeing that everyone starts it (or at least says they have started) but doesn't complete it, maybe there's something mysterious and hard about Oracle support.

Yes, it would be a hard job. Oracle doesn't have a way to quote strings (escape special characters), so one needs to pass a list (or dictionary) of parameters along with parametrized query string. This requires changing the way SQLObject generates queries. I've started to work on this, but there is a long road in front of me. Please join if you are really interested to help.</div>

While this will cause a problem for BLOBs and some other types without a SQL literal representation, Oracle <em>does</em> have literal representation of most types of data.  It's suboptimal to translate literals into SQL for Oracle to later parse, but it's doable and the way all the other database backends are working at the moment.  <em>Most</em> parts of SQLObject would be easy to implement for Oracle, with some border cases that are going to be more difficult.</div>

To a degree its easier here, because SQLObject already centralizes a lot of these operations -- so the descriptors are actually thin delegates back to fixed SQLObject methods.  The triggers and events would then also be centrally managed, and would actually be registered during <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">__addtoclass__</span></tt>.  There's still some complexity to multiple triggers being fired (and then what order they get fired in, especially when one invalidates the other)... but I'll have to wait to figure that out when the infrastructure is in place to add that complexity ;)</div>

<p>Maybe it's a bit late, but you already don't need to use <cite>eval</cite> for the dynamically generated lambdas.</p>
<p>e.g. this:</p>

getter = eval('lambda self: self._SO_loadValue(%s)' % repr(instanceName(name)))

<p>If that sort of thing really matters to your application, then wouldn't you be using a database that had native triggers anyway?</p>
<p>Drawing the line between what you put in app logic and what you put in the database is always tricky. But I tend towards the view that basic data integrity self-defence is more reliable if done in/by the database.</p>
<p>You might put it in the application because:
- it's portable across databases (but how often in real life do people decide to switch the database behind a serious application that their business depends on?)
- it works for databases that don't support those things natively (but why would you use one of those if data integrity was a serious concern?)
- you can see and maintain all your logic in one place</p>
<p>You might put it in the database because:
- it's probably probably more efficient. Assume people building databases know more about how to do this sort of stuff quickly and reliably than you (for any likely value of &quot;you&quot;) do.
- it can't be bypassed by people accessing the same database from a different client application, or even by somebody else writng a different part of the same application</p>
<p>I notice that even MySQL might have triggers soon: <a class="reference" href="http://rootprompt.org/article.php3?article=8289">http://rootprompt.org/article.php3?article=8289</a></p>

In general, I agree, a company probably doesn't switch databases very often.   I started my personal project using sqlite and moved over to mysql after development was under way.   All it took was a change in the connection string ( and some refactoring to use datetime instead of mx.DateTime which doesn't count ).  SQLObject's ability to easily switch backend stores helps me a lot - it makes it easier for me to develop and choose a provider when the time comes.   But this is probably true more for small efforts than corporate IT infrastructure projects.</div>

If you're writing an in-house app, or one targeted at only one DB, then putting the triggers in the DB can make sense (because you don't change databases often, as you pointed out). But if you're writing an app on top of SQLObject which you then want others to use with many different databases, it's nice to write the triggers once, rather than once for each potential target DB.</div>

<div class="document">
<p>Well, like other people said, SQLObject can be used at a lower level than any single deployment -- SQLObject can be part of a project which may get installed anywhere.  This just came up for a user: <a class="reference" href="http://www.crummy.com/2005/02/18/0">http://www.crummy.com/2005/02/18/0</a> -- and it will come up all the time for open source developers that distribute projects based on SQLObject.</p>
<p>But even then, database triggers are limited; they can operate on the database, but not otherwise.  So, if your dependent object isn't a SQLObject instance then a database trigger won't accomplish anything.  E.g., if you want a <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">FileCol</span></tt> which only stores a filename in the database, and that file needs to be deleted along with the row.  Or if you have two separate databases that have dependencies across the databases.</p>
<p>And even when you are only dealing with the database, database triggers <em>still</em> aren't sufficient, because they don't give SQLObject any feedback, so it doesn't know how to update its cache.  SQLObject, for reasons tied to its very ORMness, has problems when the database gets updated behind its back.  I'd like to fix some of those problems (and some of these features could help), but in this case SQLObject could still cache aggressively in the presence of in-process cascades.</p>

<p>Good points, Ian. I think I detect a fairly fundamental difference in worldview/emphasis/(don't say the p*gm word!) between:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>the application as the primary thing and the db as a dumb persistence store</li>
</ol>
<p>versus ...</p>
<ol class="arabic simple" start="2">
<li>the data as the primary thing and the dbms as its primary guardian; triggers (etc) as the immune system that protect it from things malicious/miguided applications might try to get up to.</li>
</ol>
<p>It's a design decision about at what layer in the stack you want to have your basic data integrity defence mechanisms, with different valid answers in different circumstances. Although what you seem to be saying/implying is that SQLObject won't be able to cope if you put them anywhere other than in the app's persistence layer. I would expect that (with all due respect) to be very significantly slower and less reliable than native triggers in any mature production rdbms - especially if the app isn't running on the same machine. And even if you can live with that, what if you aren't the only application - or the only instance of the same application - that's talking to the same database?</p>
<p>So you would appear to be limited to one instance of one application that &quot;owns&quot; the database entirely. Which of course is perfectly adequate in many circumstances, but severely limits what you can do if you want to load balance your app / run with existing production databases that already have integrity protections in place / etc.</p>
