                            is doing something vaguely similar (at least in
                            motivation, at some level), using constraints

                            David Binger did a lightning talk on a system he
                            wrote -- who's name I've forgotten -- which is also
                            constraint-based and could benefit from a way to
                            represent constraints

                    <p>
                        I think the various numeric packages do things along
                        these lines, often with operator overloading and
                        whatnot, so that you can give an expression that is
                        efficiently implemented in a specific context. This is
                        similar in spirit to what the ORMs are doing, except
                        where the ORMs use the expression to generate SQL to be
                        sent off somewhere, the numeric packages consume the
                        expression in-process (but not in Python).

                Underlying this vaguely-defined feature is the same featureset
                as LINQ, and it's something that people have been doing in
                Python for some time despite the fact that the language doesn't
                support it particularly well. It would be in my personal top 3
                features that I'd like to see in py3k.

                    I believe I've seen something like this described for an
                    experimental version of Haskell; they had an operator that
                    you used to prefix an expression and it returned the AST for
                    that expression. One important feature was that they also
                    had the opposite feature -- you could use another operator
                    in the thus-quoted expression and it would evalulate that
                    subtree and a normal expression, and substitute the result
                    in the tree. They probably used it to implement a macro
                    facility (though the example I remember was a type-safe
                    printf facility).
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'm going to place the ball firmly in the court of those who
                    want this feature: please write a proposal <em>and</em> an
                    implementation. All that work is <em>not</em> going to get
                    your proposal accepted for certain, but it'll let me look at
                    it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    (You know, I really hate to be in the position of the parent
                    always saying &quot;no&quot;. But there's gotta be someone
                    who ensures that Python 3000 will in fact be Python 3000 and
                    not Perl 7. There are many, many more possible changes to
                    the language than can possibly be accepted. We have to
                    prioritize.)

                So, the challenge is out. In order to put this feature up for

                <li>An implementation</li>
                <li>A justification/PEP</li>
                <li>
                    Tests, both for the implementation and the justification
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                So: if you are interested in this sort of feature, please pop on
                over to the

                    Couple of years ago I was trying to understand Tomcat, and
                    got stuck with its security model. To the best of my grasp
                    of the core code, Tomcat was using an XML parser and
                    introspection against the JVM to treat a configuration file
                    like a script. Byzantine.
