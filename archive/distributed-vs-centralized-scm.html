        <h1>Distributed vs. Centralized Version Control</h1>

        <div class="document">
            <p>
                If you've paid any attention, you'll have noticed there's a ton
                of new version control systems. It's a little odd, really -- the
                community languished with CVS for such a long time. CVS got lots
                of really important things right, but as we all know it also was
                a mess. Then
                <a class="reference" href="http://subversion.tigris.org/"
                    >Subversion</a
                >
                and
                <a class="reference" href="http://www.gnuarch.org/">Arch</a>
                came along with two different models -- one based closely on CVS
                (Subversion), and one based on a new distributed model. Arch
                seems crufty and difficult, or maybe it's just that its designer
                has a somewhat crufty and difficult personality... but clearly
                that branch of design has had an explosion of implementations,
                where Subversion remains alone (though far more successful).
            </p>
            <p>
                People treat the benefit of distributed development as
                self-evident, but I don't agree. The best real justification
                I've seen of the centralized model is Greg Hudson's
                <a
                    class="reference"
                    href="http://web.mit.edu/ghudson/thoughts/bitkeeper.whynot"
                    >Why Bitkeeper Isn't Right For Free Software</a
                >, which is still relevant since it wasn't about the BK license
                or proprietary software. All the arguments against BK on the
                basis of license have been clearly proven, but the model remains
                relevant. The basic argument Greg makes is that the Linux
                development process is an anomaly and doesn't apply to most
                projects.
            </p>
            <p>
                But I think this can be taken further. There's nothing wrong
                with the centralized model. There <em>is</em> something wrong
                with the way we are using Subversion (and CVS before it). The
                wrongness isn't that you need a server, or a network connection,
                or disk space. It's that you need commit privileges.
            </p>
            <p>
                I see these issues as the important ones that source control can
                solve for open source:
            </p>
            <ol class="arabic simple">
                <li>
                    Getting people's work off their hard disks, where it is dead
                    and useless to the community.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Making work available and locatable by other developers.
                </li>
                <li>Making it easy to understand the changes made.</li>
                <li>Making it easy to integrate changes.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                The distributed systems do some work on (1), usually by not
                needing a &quot;server&quot; (except maybe for rsync and any web
                server). But frankly the &quot;server-less&quot; systems they
                set up are usually much more complex in practice than a single
                well-maintained server. Now that Subversion has fixed many of
                its server problems (with fsfs among other things), server
                maintenance is really not a problem. And we share the work
                around; there are far fewer servers than developers, and that
                works fine.
            </p>
            <p>
                But more practically, I think distributed systems enable private
                work in a way that is bad for the community. I think the private
                workflow so touted by distributed systems is a total
                non-feature, even an anti-feature. Open source development
                should happen in the open; that's what people usually want to
                do, and that's what we should encourage at every opportunity.
            </p>
            <p>
                The distributed systems offer nothing for (2). Centralized
                systems allow you to list the files and branches and whatnot.
                Subversion made an important improvement on CVS by making the
                branching and tagging very transparent, where it was somewhat
                invisible and mysterious in CVS. That makes a real and practical
                difference in the usability of branching. Distributed systems
                are a step back in this respect.
            </p>
            <p>
                Honestly I don't know how distributed systems compare on (3) and
                (4). Subversion could definitely be better, but I don't think
                that has anything to do with centralization. I find handling
                patches very difficult, but I think merging branches in
                Subversion is generally easier, and with far more room for
                improvement. As an aside, I don't see why the exchange of
                patches in email is even relevant in a usable and complete
                system -- emailing files around is a crappy interface for
                everyone. Making it less crappy is missing the point; email is
                not a good file transfer protocol. But because Linus does
                everything in email... <em>sigh</em>.
            </p>
            <p>
                But centralized version control <em>does</em> need to become
                more open. The difference between someone with commit access and
                some random contributor should be reduced. Anonymous commits
                should be allowed (or commits with a very low registration
                threshold -- strict anonymity isn't really important here). The
                tools should be usable enough that we can say &quot;we don't
                accept patches, we only accept pointers to branches in our
                repository&quot;. Maybe we could even say &quot;we accept bug
                reports, but we prefer bug reports in the form of commits into
                our
                <tt class="docutils literal"
                    ><span class="pre">bug_example/</span></tt
                >
                directory&quot;. We should stop using Wikis, and just use web
                frontends to our version control.
            </p>
            <p>
                There's great potential in version control -- but it's all in
                usability and tools, security and scaling, not the mathematical
                appeal of patch management algorithms.
            </p>
            <p>
                People like to talk about the benefit of open source's
                distributed development, but I think the communal aspect is just
                as important. We all already know that a successful open source
                developer must play well with others, much both follow and lead
                in different projects, must be able to handle and resolve
                personal and technical conflicts. We succede when we work in
                public; so why should we be so drawn to version control that
                encourages isolation, where everything is a fork?

                    I wish you would have went into this level of detail a month
                    ago or so when we were talking about setting up a public
                    repository for patterns. You're making a ton of sense here.
                    I think you could have a workable model w/ subversion if you
                    could figure out how to:
                </p>
                <ol class="arabic simple">
                    <li>
                        Self-register or distribute identity. Anonymous write is
                        a non-starter...
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Tier access such that newly registered users can create
                        new branches in a sandbox area with full write access
                        but not be able to write outside of their own branches
                        until they were granted higher access.
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    I wonder if a simple web front end might not help accomplish
                    a lot of this. A form takes a username/password + source
                    branch and create a new &quot;free branch&quot; somewhere
                    and spits that out as a result. This could also have a
                    web/machine interface that you could probably wrap with five
                    lines of bash/curl to have a nice little CLI:
                </p>
                <pre class="literal-block">
$ svn_share -u username http://example.com/reposhare/trunk
Hello username, we don't know you. Enter a password for jailed access...
Password: *********
Your branch is http://example.com/repo/username/01/
</pre
                >
                <p>
                    The command might be best as a wrapper around
                    <tt class="docutils literal"
                        ><span class="pre">svn</span>
                        <span class="pre">co</span></tt
                    >
                    that would have basic logic for establishing the account and
                    creating one of these &quot;free branches&quot; and then
                    checking it out.
                </p>
                <p>This leads to some problems:</p>
                <ul class="simple">
                    <li>
                        Branch bombs - The branching mechanism is cheap but
                        you'd have to put some kind of basic constraints around
                        creation.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Stale branch detection - It would be nice to have some
                        heuristic for determining if a branch was actually
                        valuable and to clean up those that aren't.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    At any rate, I'm interested in hearing more on this if
                    you've thought about implementation at all.

                        For self-registration it might be sufficient simply to

                        I am worried about security though, especially since
                        Subversion is written in C. C does not encourage
                        confidence in security. Not a big issue when you trust
                        everyone you authorize, but if authorization is opened
                        up...

                            One way to do this would be to hook the
                            authentication into something like Bugzilla. We did
                            that at work so that both subversion and bugzilla
                            had the same set of users with just one place to
                            have to deal with them -- the username was a full
                            email address for subversion. This also gives the
                            ability to self-register, reset passwords, etc. A
                            few changes to bugzilla would probably allow patches
                            to point to subversion changes and allow sharing
                            write access to branches.

                        I'll have to throw my approval in on this one as well. I
                        have been using GNU Arch for some time now, and although
                        it is a powerful SCM, it's definitely not the easiest
                        thing to use. Bazaar has addressed some of these issues
                        while remaining compatible with GNU Arch. Tom Lord has
                        pre-released GNU Arch 2.0, which is another complete
                        rewrite that borrows ideas from Linus' Git. It's not a
                        feature-complete SCM yet, but it appears to be picking
                        up steam. Hopefully, he'll incoporate the usibility
                        features in Bazaar into the new version.

                        I have not jumped on the Subversion bandwagon, partially
                        because it had such a rocky start right about the time I
                        was looking for a new SCM. I have it installed, but only
                        to pull your source code, at which point I slough it off
                        to whatever SCM I might be playing with at the time.

                        I have not used monotone because of its dependence upon
                        OpenSSL libraries and the inability to incorporate
                        GPG/OpenPGP utilities (though that's such a little nit
                        that I should probably reconsider). I'm also not
                        entirely comfortable with having to cut-n-paste SHA-1
                        strings just to get a branch I want. (Git suffers from
                        this, too.) Mercurial incorporates a versioned tagging
                        system that allows you to set arbitrary names to
                        revisions and travels with the archive. You can also set
                        local tags that do not get transfered, which allows you
                        to make less &quot;official&quot; notes about what a
                        branch or revision represents. +1 for Mercurial.

                        Codeville has some interesting merging algorithms, but
                        ease of use is by far the more important thing to
                        consider. Darcs has gotten some bad press regarding its
                        memory consumption and long operations when merging with
                        large histories, though these might be fixed by now.

                        Canonical is sponsoring the development of Bazaar-ng,
                        another python-based SCM that borrows ideas from GNU
                        Arch and Bazaar. I don't really know where it is in a
                        feature-wise comparison, but it's a relatively new
                        project. Now that GNU Arch 2.0 is in alpha, I'm not sure
                        if bazaar-ng is going to take the new direction (I
                        haven't been following that closely lately).

                        That brings us back to Mercurial. It's a mouthful to
                        say, but the commandline is a terse
                        <cite>hg COMMAND</cite> style. It's very cvs-like in the
                        way it feels, yet shares a lot of properties with
                        monotone and codeville. It is self-hosting and can
                        publish over HTTP. A CGI front-end is provided so you
                        can incoporate it with your favorite web server. The
                        CGI/web front-end looks a lot like gitweb, the Perl git
                        front-end on kernel.org, though there have been recent
                        patches to the list that really improve on the
                        presentation. Plus, it's FAST! (And written in Python,
                        non-the-less.)

                        It sounds like the developer on Mercurial has the
                        technical parts down well. I don't know about usability,
                        especially since it seems like it's a contender for
                        Linux development, and I think Linux developers (or
                        maybe just Linus) have distorted ideas about usable
                        version control.

                        is, but they seem the most concerned with basic
                        usability issues. Other ones can be better or worse in
                        terms of usability -- Arch is pretty horrible from what
                        I can tell, and Darcs is pretty straight-forward. Many
                        of them put so much emphasis on the distributed part,
                        that continuous integrating (the norm in Subversion or
                        CVS) is an Excersize Left Up To The Reader.

                        It is interesting that this latest generation of version

                            From a usability perspective, Mercurial is quite
                            similar to both CVS and SVN. Commands that

                    I've just started playing with it for personal projects. CVS
                    is too crufy, and Subversion has too many requirements for
                    my personal stuff (though we moved from VSS to Subversion at
                    the office and have never been happier).

                    Back to darcs -- the commands are easy. It seems to be
                    distribuated when you want it to be and centralized when you
                    want. The fact that you can immediately mail patches back
                    and forth, and pull any source tree off the web and into are
                    cool features.

                    &quot;But centralized version control does need to become
                    more open. The difference between someone with commit access
                    and some random contributor should be reduced&quot;

                    True to a very large extent and it focusses on a very
                    important issue. Subversion has a very specific problem when
                    used with free/open source projects. It pretends that patch
                    management is none of it's business, since all it promises
                    to be is a better CVS. But remember that CVS itself is
                    probably two decades old and should not be setting the bar
                    for any version control software beyond a certain extent.
                    Now we know after a decade+ of distributed software
                    development in which not everyone has commit privilieges,
                    that there are problems with the way patches are handled.
                    But it probably best not to depende on the SVN project
                    itself to do this. As you note in another excellent point:-
                    &quot;There's great potential in version control -- but it's
                    all in usability and tools, security and scaling, not the
                    mathematical appeal of patch management algorithms.&quot;.
                    Tortoise SVN and SVK are the only two SVN based projects
                    that have had any real impact. I am not sure though about
                    that bit about &quot;patch management algorithms&quot;. It's
                    a prominent shortcoming/defect in SVN that it does have a

                    Hmmm... Your idea of anonymous commits seems like a possible
                    source of unintended consequences. I'll throw out the term
                    'wikification' to describe it. I love wikis, but there is a
                    significant maintenance cost, due to flaws in human nature.
                    You'd almost have to automatically build on every commit,
                    and roll back changes that no worky-worky, and then black
                    list bogus committers somehow. The haters of open source
                    would likely DOS a lot of projects. Ultimately, there is a
                    huge learning curve before stepping into any project. Even
                    if I know python (and I consider myself a medium-weight), I
                    probably can't do useful work until I've interacted
                    significantly with the team, beyond trivial bugfixing. So,
                    I'm luke-warm on the idea.

                    I work as a team leader in a small/medium-sized developer
                    team, and we are using CVS/subversion successfully, but
                    after playing around with darcs for a toy project, we also
                    think about moving to a SCM without a central server. May be
                    we are a &quot;to agile&quot; or whatever, but sometimes it
                    would be just nice to sync with the repository of my
                    coworker without submitting it to a central server or using
                    branches. And approaching a release all my team members
                    start to merge with a central repository. May be I must say,
                    that I highly appreciate the way Guido (GvR) and Linus
                    manage there projects. And I guess this can be applied to a
                    lot of open source software too. Well, and email is not to
                    bad for patch &quot;movement&quot;, isn't it? I think, the
                    way darcs does it, is the best. Some people can commit
                    directly, the rest has to send the patches by mail.

                    The ability to submit a patch directly via the version
                    control system so that the project leader(s) can review and
                    merge it as desired would be a great boon. You'd certainly
                    think that SVN could be given explicit support for this
                    feature, and I think that SVN is the best candidate given
                    how much acceptance it has gained.

                <p>
                    One thing that should be kept in mind with regards to
                    accepting anonymous or nearly anonymous patches is the whole
                    Linux/SCO nonsense. While only a project as successful as
                    Linux is likely to gain that level of attention, it's always
                    good to have an idea of who is vouching for a piece of code
                    (and whether they wrote it themselves) when you're adding it
                    to your repository.

                        In some of my thoughts about building systems on top of
                        Subversion, I've thought about expressing workflow
                        through custom properties, and acting on those in hooks.
                        So instead of patches you'd have branches, and a
                        submission would be a flag/property on the branch that
                        said you were ready for someone to look at it. The
                        &quot;ready for someone to look at it&quot; is almost an
                        indexing operation as much as anything.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Though another possibility might be special conventions.
                        For instance, it would be nice to encapsulate
                        discussions of patches in the version control system as
                        well. Maybe a file (<tt class="docutils literal"
                            ><span class="pre">discussion.txt</span></tt
                        >
                        or something) could store that information. This would
                        be like pushing the Trac database into Subversion. I'm
                        not sure if this would work with Subversion in practice,
                        but that's the kind of feature that could make me
                        switch.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        That reminds me of Subversion hooks -- there's a lot of
                        power there. I don't think that's transferable to a
                        distributed system.

                    Distributed version control software is not incompatible
                    with communal, centralized development. In practice, most
                    projects that use distributed software still have one
                    central repository that everyone syncs and submits to.
                    They're not using the distributed software to split
                    development off into isolated forks; they're using it
                    precisely to allow work to be shared more easily without
                    such hard boundaries between established developers and new

            Ian,
            <p>
                The key point I see missing here is the fact that centralized
                development is a subset of what a distributed model can do. At
                <a href="http://www.summersault.com">Summersault</a> we switched
                from CVS to <a href="http://www.darcs/">darcs</a>, but kept the
                centralized development model for the most part.
            </p>

            <p>
                darcs offers us many benefits, including
                <a href="http://wiki.darcs.net/index.html/SpontaneousBranches"
                    >spontaneous branches</a
                >, interactive commits and updates, a smart patch algebra, and
                working on private branches we need.
            </p>

            <p>
                You can read my full write up of
                <a href="http://mark.stosberg.com/Tech/darcs/cvs_switch/"
                    >our switch from CVS to darcs</a
                >.
            </p>

            <p>
                For open source work I also use darcs. We start of using 'darcs
                send' to exchange patches by e-mail, which works great. For
                small projects my website works as a central public repo for
                read only access, and I filter commits through my e-mail.
            </p>

            <p>
                For larger projects, we can set of a central server for darcs
                (which is just copying files a web server), and give a group of
                comitters ssh access to commit there, while others contribute by
                e-mail.
            </p>

            <p>
                I use svn for one project and am definitely slowed down because
                it doesn't offer interactive commits, updates or easy
                cherrypicking of patches.
            </p>

            <p>Try darcs.</p>

                        I think there's a good possibility that one of the
                        distributed systems will focus on making centralized
                        development work well. I don't think they've done that
                        yet. They are ignoring something important as a result.
                        Since there's so much competition at the moment
                        hopefully someone will try to differentiate in this way.
                        I can even imagine a centralized fork; just like svk is
                        like fork of svn, the opposite might happen. At least, I
                        hope it does -- I personally am not tied to Subversion.

                        I think that should be the first thing to happen for a
                        new project. Personally I &quot;set up&quot; a central
                        server for all of my projects now, because I happen to
                        have an svn repository at my disposal. Keeping 1 project
                        or 100 projects in one svn server isn't substantially
                        more difficult. Managing permissions is a pain... but
                        eh. Easier than ssh accounts at least. I'm also
                        generally fine giving people access based on informal
                        agreements about permission.

                        I don't think these are problems with centralized
                        servers. There's hard problems to be solved, and it's
                        clear the new batch of version control systems is
                        addressing many of those problems better than Subversion
                        has. (And it's not surprising they are doing it with
                        high-level languages.) Subversion hooks have a
                        tremendous amount of potential, though, and I'd hate to
                        lose that feature.

                        Working with a centralized server is arguably easier
                        with darcs than svn.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Svn recommends you think about your branches, tags, and
                        overall layout when you create the project. There is no
                        need for this in darcs.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Svn has a special command, 'svn import' for starting a
                        project. darcs has a syntax that is as easy to use, but
                        more general purpose, as it can be used whenever you
                        want to creat a new branch:
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        darcs put
                        mark@otherserver.com:/home/repos/my_new_project
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        There is nothing special to learn about users and
                        permissions, as you can use unix permissions and ssh, or
                        gpg-signed e-mail to transport patches.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        It's not clear to this to me why this wouldn't be
                        considered "working well". It has the added benefit that
                        casual contributors can still commit repeatedly offline
                        on their laptops before sync'ing, or easily create their
                        own branch.
                    </p>

                    I don't think current centralized SCMs can accomodate large
                    numbers of development branches. The problem comes when
                    mainline development activity is merged into those branches
                    to produce a more up-to-date branch. In CVS and svn, such a
                    merge duplicates the mainline changes--even changes to
                    unmodified files--into the back-end storage system. So, a
                    hundred actively maintained development branches means your
                    mainline development is consuming a hundred times as much
                    space. I've brought up cleverer ways of representing big
                    merges in Subversion, but there hasn't been a whole lot of
                    interest so far. For the most part, projects seem happy
                    storing patches in an issue-tracking system to represent
                    small changes--not a very elegant solution, but one which
                    eliminates 95% of the efficiency problem with branches.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The distributed SCM answer is to use a hundred times as many
                    hard drives to hold the data. That works fine, but the
                    perception of distributed functionality as an anti-feature
                    is not unique to you: other projects, like gcc, would much
                    rather see development go on &quot;in the open&quot; in the
                    central repository, rather than off to the side where it's
                    harder to find.

                        Subversion does do branching cheaply. The whole tree is
                        not copied into the branch: subversion internally stores
                        what amounts to a symbolic link.

                    <p>
                        It may be the case that if you check out from the top of
                        the tree, you'll get multiple copies of the files. I'm
                        just pointing out how the repository itself works. (This
                        is all described in the svn book.)

                            in foo. Instead, the modified trunk files could be
                            &quot;re-branched&quot;. You'd still need a new

                            be with the new pointers. This is probably yet
                            another issue that really needs true branch and

                    Changeset-based &quot;distributed&quot; version control
                    systems (like my favorite, darcs) make patch management and
                    integration possible in a way I haven't seen in subversion,
                    and I see patch management as central to defining the trunk
                    of a project. Say you want to merge the changes I've made
                    over the past three days, because I just made my branch of
                    SQLObject self-aware. (Bouyeah.) With a tree-based VCS you
                    must calculate a diff between my tree three days ago and my
                    tree now and apply that patch to your tree. With a
                    changeset-based VCS, you just apply my patches. Svn's
                    merging is rudimentary at best for this reason. I make
                    mistakes with it all the time in my repositories - and I'm
                    the only committer!

                    About hooks, I see svn like a car that you can put a

                    up to a different transmission if you like, and put in a car
                    of your choice. I can see my way much more clearly to
                    building more complex and wonderful things with darcs than i
                    can with svn (e.g., making some sort of dynamic
                    branch-maker-and-authorizer with apache and python and sane
                    security and permissions and discussion, that deletes old
                    stale branches and doesn't take too much space).

                    In using a distributed version control system, I found the
                    ability to create what you might call micro branches quite
                    useful. In an environment where we were juggling lots of
                    small changes to a large system, being able to create a
                    local staging environment and repository for each small
                    feature is extremely helpful.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The problem with putting all of that in the central
                    repository is that, aside from Subversion's branch merging
                    difficulty, it would clutter up the repository with
                    branches. From the POV of the main repository, each of these
                    minor fixes were coming through as normal commits was quite
                    nice, even though on our desktops they amounted to micro
                    branches.

                        How big of a problem is a microbranch in Subversion?
                        Greg pointed out that they aren't stored efficiently,
                        but if you make a modification in a branch and then
                        integrate it into the trunk, it only doubles the storage
                        of diffs, no more (at least if I read his comment
                        correctly) -- that doesn't seem so bad. I know I
                        underuse short-lived branches, but Subversion doesn't
                        disallow them; you can delete a branch as soon as you
                        are done with it. The only real issue is that its
                        merging is rather poor, so it discourages branching.

                    <p>
                        That said, I do see the usefulness of &quot;spontaneous
                        branching&quot; as Mark termed it. There is a certain
                        oddity to the special place the checkout has in
                        Subversion, where in distributed systems there isn't
                        anything quite like a checkout, and there's an
                        opportunity to be somewhat more cohesive as a result.

                    Well - centralized version control is a <em>subset</em> of
                    distributed version control, since you can still upload (or
                    &quot;push&quot;) stuff from your branches to the project's
                    central server. What distributed version control adds is the
                    voluntarity of this action, and freedom to fork the project
                    independently while keeping the history and the possibility
                    to merge back in the future easily. (And some other bonuses
                    like ability to work offline.)
                </p>
                <p>
                    So the question is whether this kind freedom is a good
                    thing. For the forking issue, if you want to fork, you will
                    do that anyway and I doubt you will care that much about how
                    hard would that be. But at least you will retain the full
                    history, and it will be possible to easily merge the
                    projects back later, which I'd say makes the situation at
                    least somewhat better than with centralized VCS.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The &quot;voluntary publication&quot; is probably less
                    clear-cut, but I think it's better this way as well. How
                    does this stuff usually go? If you are new developer, you
                    decide &quot;I need this thing to do X&quot; or &quot;this Y
                    thing is bothering me&quot;. So you can either:
                </p>
                <ul class="simple">
                    <li>
                        first ask for a branch on the central server. No matter
                        how low the threshold is, this forces you into some kind
                        of a commitment, at least social-like. &quot;Yet sworn
                        word may strengthen quaking heart&quot; - &quot;Or break
                        it&quot;. At any rate, this will make you reconsider if
                        you are really sure you will finish this and likely
                        discourage you from trying.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        first hack. If you are successful, you can upload this
                        (and you will do that as likely as you would with the
                        centralized version control), but you had no version
                        control while hacking! After all, this is one of the
                        main points of distributed version control - you can
                        version control your private development so that there
                        is some history when you actually publish it. If you are
                        NOT successful hacking, noone will likely ever see your
                        work, and that's probably core of your argument against
                        it. The question is, whether it outweights all the other
                        disadvantages, and whether that unsuccessful work is
                        actually worth seeing - I think it isn't, up to some
                        rather rare exceptions.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    The bottom line is, I argue that the additional freedom
                    distributed VCS gives you is a good thing and actually
                    significantly lowers the barrier for new hacks by making it
                    easier to do them and potentially reducing the bureaucracy.

                        Petr, it's what happens <em>after</em> you've worked on

                        it to the world that's the interesting question.

                        You can make a patch and post it to Bugzilla, or you can
                        publish your repo on your own server where the
                        maintainers can pull from. Bugzilla isn't as attractive
                        as some kind of anonymous micro-branch, which after all
                        is basically what your patch is. Publishing your own
                        repo is not stable over time. In reality, patches often
                        wait many months for integration, and private repos are
                        likely to move or go down, and you still have the
                        problem of tracking the links to all the private repos.

                    <p>
                        It seems that the problem with turning anonymous patches
                        into anonymous branches is that svn can't merge between
                        repos (e.g. main and pending-patches), and people are
                        uncomfortable adding anon branches to the main svn repo.
                        Right?

                As of subversion 1.4.0 and its client/server support for
                "svnsync", you can indeed replicate a repository with nothing
                more than anonymous read access. Prior to 1.4.0, there were
                hacks to accomplish more or less the same thing, and you could
                always use rsync if you had shell access to the server.

                    better than with centralized VCS.

                That part of the problem, subversion does not solve.

                    &quot;As an aside, I don't see why the exchange of patches
                    in email is even relevant in a usable and complete system --
                    emailing files around is a crappy interface for everyone.
                    Making it less crappy is missing the point; email is not a
                    good file transfer protocol. But because Linus does
                    everything in email... sigh.&quot;
                </p>
                <p>
                    Well that's a shame, because emailing patches solves 1, 2,
                    3, and 4. 1) It gets it out into the community. Anyone can
                    look at a mailing list and see the patches that have been
                    made to a project. A project I'm working on currently uses
                    gitweb, which lists all the recent commits to a repository,
                    with the tags and commit message visible, and you can view
                    any patch you want with a click. 2) We attach patches to bug
                    reports and e-mails. All our commit messages that are
                    related to a bug report have the bug number and link back to
                    the bug report from gitweb. Similarly, each resolved bug has
                    a git commit id. Each author has his own repository remotely
                    (on a server) as well as on their own machines. Anyone can
                    find work in no time by just looking up a bug, looking at
                    gitweb, or reading the mailing list. 3) Seriously, what
                    could be easier to understand than a patch? Sending it in an
                    e-mail doesn't mean someone is going to commit the patch
                    straight out of an e-mail. Sending it in an e-mail is a good
                    way for people on a mailing list (e.g. developers and
                    contributors) to verify correctness of a patch and to
                    possibly locate more flaws. 4) The whole patch concept
                    couldn't be easier. You write some code, you commit it and
                    the patch is generated for you, you don't even need to look
                    at a patch at all if you don't want to. Then you can push it
                    to a remote repository. What's more is that outside
                    contributors can e-mail a patch or attach it to a bug report
                    that any developer can include in their program. The project
                    I contribute to has dozens of contributors and they often
                    work in this way, speeding up development. They even get
                    their name on the commit.

                <p>
                    &quot;But I think this can be taken further. There's nothing
                    wrong with the centralized model. There is something wrong
                    with the way we are using Subversion (and CVS before it).
                    The wrongness isn't that you need a server, or a network
                    connection, or disk space. It's that you need commit
                    privileges.&quot;
                </p>
                <p>
                    You make no mention about how this is different for the
                    distributed model.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Your issue with 1) is a non-issue with proper design.
                    Centralized or not, no code is useful to anyone until you
                    push it. Distributed systems can have one repository if you
                    prefer, though this basically defeats the purpose of a
                    distributed system.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Your article could say instead that not all these features
                    are _inherent_ in distributed systems. Distributed systems
                    (git/cogito, atleast) are a bit more low-level than CVS and
                    SVN, which means that you have to take some sort of care
                    when setting one up for a project. But if you're not
                    completely braindead, this should be easy. Set up a central
                    repository for your project, then set up repositories for
                    each author. Make sure all authors file bugs or feature
                    requests that they can link their commits to. And, of
                    course, keep commits small (meaning solve one problem at a
                    time).
                </p>
                <p>
                    As for your closing paragraph, this is plain nonsense. The
                    point of distribution _is_ the communal aspect. With
                    distribution, you allow (and encourage!) anyone in the
                    community to participate in the development process. This
                    tracks back to e-mail, which is a very convenient way for
                    John Doe to send in a patch for a bug he found in your
                    program. It's a lot better than having to whine to the
                    program devs about a bug and have them solve the problem.
                    And it's better than creating an account for John Doe to
                    commit his one patch to your centralized repository. The
                    focus isn't on isolation, it's on distribution; you're
                    confusing these terms. Yes, they are related terms, but the
                    isolation here is of a specific problem, not an entire
                    project. There is no more encouragement to fork than with
                    any other SCM. Anyone can grab the source for a project and
                    fork it no matter what SCM is used. The encouragement is for
                    different authors to work on problems in a _distributed_
                    manner towards the goals of the whole project.
