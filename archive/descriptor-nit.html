</div><h1>Descriptor Nit</h1>
 <p>
There are some problems with <a href="http://blog.colorstudy.com/ianb/weblog/2004/07/15.html#P131"><tt>setonce</tt></a>,
one being that the resulting classes can't be pickled, because the
attributes are unstable.  <tt>setonce</tt> stores its data in the
instance in a numbered attribute (e.g., <tt>_setonce_attr_15</tt>),
and that number can change depending on the order in which you
construct classes and attributes.

<p>
It would be better if <tt>setonce</tt> named that attribute something
like <tt>_setonce_classname_attrname</tt>, which would be stable.
Relatedly, it would be nice if the errors could included the real
attribute name.

<p>
The problem is that <tt>setonce</tt> doesn't know where it is being
used.  It's just an anonymous object, and only when you actually get
or set an attribute can it tell what object or class it is bound to,
and it <i>still</i> can't tell what attribute it is bound to.

<p>
IMHO, this is a serious flaw in <a href="http://users.rcn.com/python/download/Descriptor.htm">descriptors</a>.
<i>Most</i> of the time I want to know what class and attribute a
descriptor is being assigned to (this comes up a lot in <a href="http://sqlobject.org">SQLObject</a> particularly).

<p>
One possibility is to use a metaclass that goes in and finds all the
descriptors with a certain method (say, <tt>__setclass__</tt>), and
call something like <tt>descriptor.__setclass__(classObject,
attributeName)</tt>.  It would be nice if there was a convention for
this; even nicer if it was built into <tt>type</tt> (the default
metaclass).  There are various questions: Should <tt>__setclass__</tt>
return a value?  Maybe a new descriptor?  Optionally?  Does this all
happen before or after the class is created?  If before, what do we
pass in in lieue of <tt>classObject</tt>?  Does this get called only
for descriptors that are being added, not for descriptors in
superclasses?  These aren't particularly hard questions to answer, but
if different people will answer them differently unless we have some
convention in place.

 FYI, check out the peak.binding.once.Activator metaclass for an example of something that does what you're trying to do here.
<br />

<br />
Specifically, it tries to adapt all its new attributes to IActiveDescriptor.  If they adapt, it calls the descriptor's 'activateInClass(klass,name)' method, and stores the result in the class dictionary in place of the original descriptor.  This happens after the class is created, but before it's returned from __new__.
<br />

<br />
This approach has worked well for PEAK for over a year now, so if you're trying to get or set a de facto standard, maybe you should follow that one.  ;)
