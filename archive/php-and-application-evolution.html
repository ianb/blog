            PHP has (until 4 at least) a niche. It's great for quick development
            of web sites that often change so quickly a whole design is not
            possible, thus the lack of artifacts keeps you from shooting
            yourself in the foot by closing and packaging your design too
            quickly.

        This is often how I feel about object-oriented programming, and
        somewhere where I think Python's imperative approach is a real feature.
        Starting on an application by building objects (or doing "whole design")
        is a bad idea, unless you know the domain well. It's better to get it
        doing what you need to do, and think about objects along the way.
        Somewhere you'll notice you keep passing around the same value(s) to a
        set of functions -- those set of values are "self", and those functions
        are methods. You'll find ways to split things into modules, etc.
        Designing objects and modules too early and you'll have lots of circular
        dependencies and poor metaphors. Of course, you can fix all those, but
        it's easier to add structure to a naive project than to reshape and
        restructure a misdeveloped project.

        <p>
            This might be more important in web applications, because this is
            important when you are starting an application. Web application
            developers tend to start more applications, since these applications
            come and go, and can be developed fairly quickly compared to other
            application domains.
        </p>

        <p>
            In this way, PHP has the right development methodology -- you start
            with some HTML, some forms and pages. You maybe factor out a few
            common parts -- header and footer, say. Then you add more logic in,
            treating the page like a script. Later in the project's life this
            seems a bit silly. In the PHP applications I've written, I always
            end up with a large portion of my files starting with
            <tt>&lt;?</tt> and ending with <tt>?&gt;</tt> with no HTML literals
            inbetween. It's also annoying to turn a PHP page into a reasonable
            function. But the basic concept is still good, even if PHP isn't a
            particularly good implementation of the idea.
        </p>

        <p>
            This is something you can do in Zope 2, but the naive implementation
            is very hard to restructure -- <i>far</i> worse than PHP. It's not
            clear to me that Zope 3 addresses this problem. It provides many
            tools for an advanced programmer, but what does it provide for the
            naive developer? What path does it provide to turn a naive
            application into something better structured? Or rather, does it
            even allow a naive application? Zope 3 is heavy on object modeling,
            but application development should start by developing functionality
            and then by finding the objects in that functionality.
        </p>

        <p>
            PHP is a very successful web development language -- and a very
            successful language, period -- and I think this development
            methodology (and a couple other features) are to thank for that.
            Python remains better than PHP in many, many ways. But I don't see
            much movement in the direction of PHP's strengths. This is
            disappointing.

            A pure object-model for web development can also be difficult
            because the requirements for a project mutate frequenly in some
            cases. The seemingly unorganized PHP structure *may* actually help
            in cases where the customer throws in disjointed requests. The thing
            I love about python is that it's philosophy of operation doesn't
            corner you like Java can, while encouraging logical structure.

            A smooth upgrade path from 'scripting' to 'structured application'
            is also a concern of the Zope 3 developers, albeit it hasn't had
            that much attention yet.
            <br />

            <br />
            I don't think Zope 3 is that heavy on object modelling. Zope 3, as
            Zope 2 has, encourages designing with objects, true, but connecting
            a new view consisting of a page template and a few python snippets
            to an existing content item is something I imagine a scripter will
            want to do. I don't think that requires a large amount of modelling.
            Customizability is what Zope 3 is all about.

            I feel your pain. It has recently come to my attention that Zope
            works well for folks who live and breathe it all the time. I don't,
            so I face the Z-shaped learning curve every time I come back to it.
            That has stymied my abilities for years now (in hindsight). I
            haven't built the systems I've wanted to because I always get
            re-stuck figuring out some alien Zope syntax for doing something
            that ought to be easy.
            <br />

            <br />
            I think I'll continue using Zope, and possibly even Plone, for
            simple things. Sure, Python scripts, maybe even simple extensions.
            But my current thinking is to add Quixote (the current front runner)
            in parallel with my Zope installation, for building "real" things,
            because then I can use a python mindset and the programming model
            becomes simple.

                    As a Python lover who also uses PHP extensively, I find that

                    ) is the Python web programming solution that is closest in
                    spirit to PHP. With Spyce, all the right ingredients that
                    made for PHP's [initial] success, such as immediacy of
                    learning and integration into an HTML page, are made
                    available while straying as little as possible from how you
                    normally do Python programming (read: nothing much new to
                    learn).

                <p>
                    Spyce's Pythonic design involves a small amount of carefully

                    Spyce has been around for a while and mature and stable
                    enough for 'heavy lifting'. It was what I settled on after
                    evaluating roughly a dozen other Python web frameworks
                    including CherryPy, Quixote, Skunk, Zope, and Webware, none
                    of which, imo, offered the clarity and ease of HTML
                    integration that PHP provides and thus were not satisfactory
                    alternatives.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Spyce can be made to run on commodity hosting that supports
                    CGI and Python (99.9% do) easily by:
                </p>

                        <li>
                            just copying over the Spyce files under a cgi-bin
                            directory

                            creating a 2-3 line .htaccess file in a directory

                    Voila! You now have Spyce working together with all the
                    features that a Python program on that server has access to
                    (including MySQL, SMTP, etc...)
                </p>
                <p>
                    Spyce can also work on top of fastCGI, mod_python as well as
                    its own server proxying behind Apache or other web server.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Oh... and before I forget... if its default [[ and ]]
                    delimiter tags turn you off, you can use the more
                    conventional &lt;% and %&gt; instead.

                <p>
                    The final icing on the cake is that the free SciTE (

                    It is arguably an a priori reality, or stated differently,
                    it should be obvious as being true to unbiased, alert and
                    clear-headed observers that people who perpetuate contrived
                    and implicitly convoluted positions in support of
                    &quot;creationalism&quot; or &quot;creation&quot; are by
                    default just plain dumb, i.e, exhibiting major gaps in thier
                    comprehensive understanding of the real universe, and lost
                    in their own erroneous beleifs and simplistic irrelevant
                    circular thinking. In my experience, such people are
                    typically mistaking a small modicum of progress in their own
                    personal intelllectual development as being a sort of
                    validation for such a position, and license to expound and
                    obsess thereon. They seem to see their advocacy of such
                    views as being a charitable contribution and selfless act.
                    They seem to confuse their own self-imposed incorporation of
                    Christian values of humble stoicism and selfless compassion
                    as representing the elegantly simple solution for our
                    increasingly crowded, diverse and dangerous world, which is
                    in their view in urgent need of a return to simple
                    Christian-style discipline, charity and restraint.
                    Conversely, they may see &quot;science&quot; as somehow
                    being associated with many of the world's current evils, and
                    therefore they opt for the simple Christian dogma,
                    amazingly, somehow uncaringly diconnected from whether or
                    not the scenario and methodology of creation in fact
                    &quot;happened&quot; or could happen here or anywhere.

                    The Scientific community, inspite of being caretaker of the
                    perpondernace of ever-evolving knowledge describing how life
                    actually does evolve seems to unfortunately remain mostly
                    silent on such matters where a swift rebuff of such views
                    would seem to be vitally demanded. Outright public ridicule,
                    including chiding, taunting of such people is unfortuntely
                    seen as base and &quot;unprofessional&quot; and in
                    contradiction to the right of people to speak their minds in
                    a free society. I propose that perpetuation of such
                    non-science and such non-sense should be differentiated and
                    condemned every bit as much as racisism, antisemitism and
                    pornography are. (as examples). Furtherance of such drivel
                    is counter to the pure thinking needed to solve the
                    emergencies that beset society today. It is blatantly
                    perposterous to place discussions of how life evolves on the
                    untold millions of planets exhibiting conditions capable of
                    supporting life alongside creationist rhetoric as being
                    balanced point-counterpoint subjects, ripe for thorough
                    public examination. So, go ahead, quit tiptoeing; call them
                    out, confront them for what they are: sadly DUMB. Let it be
                    known to the young minds of today, that such absurdly
                    dim-minded positions can not be left to stand unopposed.

                        I've never seen a blog entry so clearly defined and so
                        well argued that says absolutely nothing. Ian, you must
                        have some really cool blogbots that can spew such
                        interesting bits of blah. ;-)
