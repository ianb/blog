</div><h1>SQLObject API redesign</h1>
 
<div class="document">
<p><em>A tentative plan, 20 Jan 2004</em></p>
<p>(discussion on the mailing list, <a class="reference" href="mailto:sqlobject-discuss&#64;lists.sf.net">sqlobject-discuss&#64;lists.sf.net</a>)</p>
<div class="section" id="introduction">
<h1><a name="introduction">Introduction</a></h1>
<p>During vacation I thought about some changes that I might like to make
to SQLObject.  Several of these change the API, but not too
drastically, and I think they change the API for the better.  And we'd
not at 1.0 yet, changes are still allowed!  Here's my ideas...</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="editing-context">
<h1><a name="editing-context">Editing Context</a></h1>
<p>Taken from Modeling, the &quot;editing context&quot; is essentially a
transaction, though it also encompasses some other features.
Typically it is used to distinguish between separate contexts in a
multi-threaded program.</p>
<p>This is intended to separate several distinct concepts:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>The database backend (MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc), coupled with the
driver (MySQLdb, psycopg, etc).  (Should the driver be part of the
connection parameters?)</li>
<li>The connection parameters.  Typically these are the server host,
username, and password, but they could also be a filename or other
path.  Perhaps this could be represented with a URI, ala PEAK, but
I also dislike taking structured data and destructuring it (i.e.,
packing it into a string).  OTOH, URLs are structured, even if they
require some parsing.  Serialization of URLs is free and highly
transparent.  Python syntax is well structured and
<em>programmatically</em> considerably more transparent (in a robust
fashion), but also programmatically fairly read-only (because it is
embedded in the structure of Python source code).  We can also have
both.</li>
<li>The database transactional context.</li>
<li>The application transactional context (preferably these two would
be seemless, but they still represent somewhat distinct entities,
and a portability layer might be nice).  The application's
transactional context may include other transactions -- e.g.,
multiple databases, a ZODB transaction, etc.</li>
<li>The cache policy.  There are many different kinds of caches
potentially involved, include write batching, and per-object and
per-table caches, connection pooling, and so on.</li>
<li>Classes, which on the database side are typically tables.  (This
proposal does not attempt to de-couple classes and tables)</li>
</ul>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
from SQLObject import EditingContext
ec = EditingContext()
# every editing context automatically picks up all the SQLObject 
# classes, all magic like.
person = ec.Person.get(1) # by ID
ec2 = EditingContext() # separate transaction
person2 = ec.Person.get(1)
assert person is not person2
assert person.id == person2.id
assert person.fname == 'Guy'
person.fname = 'Gerald'
assert person2.fname == 'Guy'
ec.commit() # SQL is not sent to server
assert person2.fname == 'Guy' # Doesn't see changes
person2.fname = 'Norm'
# raises exception if locking is turned on; overwrites if locking
# is not turned on.  (Locking enabled on a per-class level)
</pre>
<p>I'm not at all sure about that example.  Mostly the confusing parts
relate to locking and when the database lookup occurs (and how late a
conflict exception may be raised).</p>
<p>Somewhere in here, process-level transactions might fit in.  That is,
even on a backend that doesn't support transactions, we can still
delay SQL statements until a commit/rollback is performed.  In turn,
we can create temporary &quot;memory&quot; objects, which is any object which
hasn't been committed to the database in any way.  To do this we'll
need sequences -- to preallocate IDs -- which MySQL and SQLite don't
really provide :(</p>
<p>Nested transactions...?  Maybe they'd fall out of this fairly easily,
especially if we define a global context, with global caches etc.,
then further levels of context will come for free.</p>
<p>We still need to think about an auto-commit mode.  Maybe the global
context would be auto-commit.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="caching">
<h1><a name="caching">Caching</a></h1>
<p>Really doing transactions right means making caching significantly
more complex.  If the cache is purely transaction-specific, then we'll
really be limiting the effectiveness of the cache.  With that in mind,
a copy-on-write style of object is really called for -- when you fetch
an object in a transaction, you can use the globally cached instance
until you write to the object.</p>
<p>Really this isn't copy-on-write, it's more like a proxy object.  Until
the object is changed, it can delegate all its columns to its global
object for which it is a proxy.  Of course, traversal via foreign keys
or joins must also return proxied objects.  As the object is changed
-- perhaps on a column-by-column basis, or as a whole on the first
change -- the object takes on the personality of a full SQLObject
instance.</p>
<p>When the transaction is committed, this transactional object copies
itself to the global object, and becomes a full proxy.  These
transactional caches themselves should be pooled -- so that when
another transaction comes along you have a potentially useful set of
proxy objects already created for you.  This is a common use case for
web applications, which have lots of short transactions, which are
often very repetitive.</p>
<p>In addition to this, there should be more cache control.  This means
explicit ways to control things like:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Caching of instances:<ul>
<li>Application/process-global definition.</li>
<li>Database-level definition.</li>
<li>Transaction/EditingContext-level definition.</li>
<li>Class-level definition.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Caching of columns:<ul>
<li>Class-level.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Cache sweep frequency:<ul>
<li>Application/process-global.</li>
<li>Database-level.</li>
<li>Class-level.</li>
<li>Doesn't need to be as complete as 1; maybe on the class level you
could only indicate that a certain class should not be sweeped.</li>
<li>Sweep during a fetch (e.g., every 100 fetches), by time or fetch
frequency, or sweep with an explicit call (e.g., to do sweeps in
a separate thread).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Cache sweep policy:<ul>
<li>Maximum age.</li>
<li>Least-recently-used (actually, least-recently-fetched).</li>
<li>Random (the current policy).</li>
<li>Multi-level (randomly move objects to a lower-priority cache,
raise level when the object is fetched again).</li>
<li>Target cache size (keep trimming until the cache is small
enough).</li>
<li>Simple policy (if enough objects qualify, cache can be of any
size).</li>
<li>Percentage culling (e.g., kill 33% of objects for each sweep;
this is the current policy).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Batching of updates (whether updates should immediately go to the
database, or whether it would be batched until a commit or other
signal).</li>
<li>Natural expiring of objects.  Even if an object must persist
because there are still references, we could expire it so that
future accesses re-query the database.  To avoid stale data.</li>
</ol>
<p>Expose some methods of the cache, like getting all objects currently
in memory.  These would probably be exposed on a class level, e.g.,
all the Addresses currently in memory via
<tt class="literal"><span class="pre">Address.cache.current()</span></tt> or something.  What about when there's a
cached instance in the parent context, but not in the present
transaction?</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="columns-as-descriptors">
<h1><a name="columns-as-descriptors">Columns as Descriptors</a></h1>
<p>Each column will become a descriptor.  That is, <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">Col</span></tt> and subclasses
will return an object with <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">__get__</span></tt> and <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">__set__</span></tt> methods.  The
metaclass will not itself generate methods.</p>
<p>A metaclass will still be used so that the descriptor can be tied to
its name, e.g., that with <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">fname</span> <span class="pre">=</span> <span class="pre">StringCol()</span></tt>, the resultant
descriptor will know that it is bound to <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">fname</span></tt>.</p>
<p>By using descriptors, introspection should become a bit easier -- or
at least more uniform with respect to other new-style classes.
Various class-wide indexes of columns will still be necessary, but
these should be able to remain mostly private.</p>
<p>To customize getters or setters (which you currently do by defining a
<tt class="literal"><span class="pre">_get_columnName</span></tt> or <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">_set_columnName</span></tt> method), you will pass
arguments to the <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">Col</span></tt> object, like:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
def _get_name(self, dbGetter):
    return dbGetter().strip()

name = StringCol(getter=_get_name)
</pre>
<p>This gets rid of <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">_SO_get_columnName</span></tt> as well.  We can
transitionally add something to the metaclass to signal an error if a
spurious <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">_get_columnName</span></tt> method is sitting around.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="construction-and-fetching">
<h1><a name="construction-and-fetching">Construction and Fetching</a></h1>
<p>Currently you fetch an object with class instantiation, e.g.,
<tt class="literal"><span class="pre">Address(1)</span></tt>.  This may or may not create a new instance, and does
not create a table row.  If you want to create a table row, you do
something like <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">Address.new(city='New</span> <span class="pre">York',</span> <span class="pre">...)</span></tt>.  This is
somewhat in contrast to normal Python, where class instantiation
(calling a class) will create a new object, while objects are fetched
otherwise (with no particular standard interface).</p>
<p>To make SQLObject classes more normal in this case, <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">new</span></tt> will
become <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">__init__</span></tt> (more or less), and classes will have a <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">get</span></tt>
method that gets an already-existant row.  E.g., <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">Address.get(1)</span></tt>
vs. <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">Address(city='New</span> <span class="pre">York',</span> <span class="pre">...)</span></tt>.  This is perhaps the most
significant change in SQLObject usage.  Because of the different
signatures, if you forget to make a change someplace you will get an
immediate exception, so updating code should not be too hard.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="extra-table-information">
<h1><a name="extra-table-information">Extra Table Information</a></h1>
<p>People have increasingly used SQLObject to create tables, and while it
can make a significant number of schemas, there are several extensions
of table generation that people occasionally want.  Since these occur
later in development, it would be convenient if SQLObject could grow
as the complexity of the programs using it grow.  Some of these
extensions are:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Table name (<tt class="literal"><span class="pre">_table</span></tt>).</li>
<li>Table type for MySQL (e.g., MyISAM vs. InnoDB).</li>
<li>Multi-column unique constraints. (Other constraints?)</li>
<li>Indexes.  (Function or multi-column indexes?)</li>
<li>Primary key type.  (Primary key generation?)</li>
<li>Primary key sequence names (for Postgres, Firebird, Oracle, etc).</li>
<li>Multi-column primary keys.</li>
<li>Naming scheme.</li>
<li>Permissions.</li>
<li>Locking (e.g., optimistic locking).</li>
<li>Inheritance (see Daniel Savard's recent patch).</li>
<li>Anything else?</li>
</ul>
<p>Some of these may be globally defined, or defined for an entire
database.  For example, typically you'll want to use a common MySQL
table type for your entire database, even though its defined on a
per-table basis.  And while MySQL allows global permission
declarations, Postgres does not and requires tedious repetitions of
the permissions for each table -- so while it's applied on a per-table
basis, it's likely that (at least to some degree) a per-database
declaration is called for.  Naming schemes are also usually
database-wide.</p>
<p>As these accumulate -- and by partitioning this list differently, the
list could be even longer -- it's messy to do these all as special
class variables (<tt class="literal"><span class="pre">_idName</span></tt>, etc).  It also makes the class logic and
its database implementation details difficult to distinguish.  Some
of these can be handled elegantly like <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">id</span> <span class="pre">=</span> <span class="pre">StringCol()</span></tt> or <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">id</span>
<span class="pre">=</span> <span class="pre">(&quot;fname&quot;,</span> <span class="pre">&quot;lname&quot;)</span></tt>.  But the others perhaps should be put into a
single instance variable, perhaps itself a class:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
class Address(SQLObject):
    class SQLMeta:
        mysqlType = 'InnoDB'
        naming = Underscore
        permission = {'bob': ['select', 'insert'],
                      'joe': ['select', 'insert', 'update'],
                      'public': ['select']}
    street = StringCol()
    ....
</pre>
<p>The metadata is found by its name (<tt class="literal"><span class="pre">SQLMeta</span></tt>), and is simply a
container.  The class syntax is easier to write and read than a
dictionary-like syntax.  Or, it could be a proper class/instance and
provide a partitioned way to handle introspection.  E.g.,
<tt class="literal"><span class="pre">Address.SQLMeta.permission.get('bob')</span></tt> or
<tt class="literal"><span class="pre">Address.SQLMeta.columns</span></tt>.  In this case values that weren't
overridden would be calculated from defaults (like the default naming
scheme and so on).</p>
<p>I'm not at all certain about how this should look, or if there are
other things that should go into the class-meta-data object.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="joins-foreign-keys">
<h1><a name="joins-foreign-keys">Joins, Foreign Keys</a></h1>
<p>First, the poorly-named <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">MultipleJoin</span></tt> and <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">RelatedJoin</span></tt> (which
are rather ambiguous) will be renamed <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">ManyToOneJoin</span></tt> and
<tt class="literal"><span class="pre">ManyToManyJoin</span></tt>.  <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">OneToOneJoin</span></tt> will also be added, while
<tt class="literal"><span class="pre">ForeignKey</span></tt> remains the related column type.  (Many2Many?
Many2many?  many2many?)</p>
<p>ForeignKey will be driven by a special validator/converter. (But will
this make ID access more difficult?)</p>
<p>Joins will return smart objects which can be iterated across.  These
smart objects will be related to <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">SelectResults</span></tt>, and allow the
same features like ordering.  In both cases, an option to retrieve
IDs instead of objects will be allowed.</p>
<p>These smarter objects will allow, in the case of ManyToManyJoin,
<tt class="literal"><span class="pre">Set</span></tt> like operations to relate (or unrelate) objects.  For
ManyToOneJoin the list/set operations are not really appropriate,
because they would reassign the relation, not just add or remove
relations.</p>
<p>It would be nice to make the Join protocol more explicit and public,
so other kinds of joins (e.g., three-way) could be more accessible.</p>

 Hi Ian:) 
<br />

<br />
This really sound strange for me. Despite i used Modeling for over 2 years now, I'm wondering why you want to have the same thing in SQLObject. 
<br />

<br />
Should SLQObject have the same API than Modeling, or MiddleKit ? 
<br />

<br />
I really think SQLObject is good for what it tend to be: 'fetching raw in the DB','caching results' and 'saving them when needed'. Modeling is far more complex, with its validation scheme, nested editing context and so on .. 
<br />

<br />
Beside i'm not a SQLObject developper, i don't really understand why you again try to _clone_ the EOF. If you really want this kind of stuff, why you don't help Modeling guy (Big) which (i really think) will be happy to count a new developper. (the team is quite small right now)
<br />

<br />

<br />
-- Random things: ---
<br />
-In the EOF there is some qualifier for fetching objects so ec.Person.get(1) really sound strange.
<br />
- The major reason why i like SQLobject it's because it do what it should. There is nothing magic about it. Simply caching by IDs. So now, if you try to write a application that use the a DB Api which do a lot of magic, like 'nested' Editing Context. This is far more complex, because you need to think about 'in which context i'm', 'is this object is my parent Ec ?' and so on .. this is why I now use SQLObject over Modeling. I need something simple, thread safe ..
<br />
- And anyway, if you really want to do something like this, take a look closer at the Modeling API. To insert a new object in DB, simply add it too the Editing Condext and ec.save() it. no new() magic .. 
<br />

<br />

<br />
Bye Bye..

 The only change I'm suggesting like Modeling is the editing context, which seems like a more elegant way to deal with transactions than SQLObject's current implementation of pseudo-connections (which is a kind of confusing API).  This doesn't change SQLObject dramatically, and wouldn't effect most of the code internally.  And given that change, SQLObject would still be very different than Modeling.
 <div align="right"><a href="http://blog.ianbicking.org/comment661.html" rel="nofollow">#</a> Ian Bicking</div><hr noshade>
 But EditingContext is the core of the modeling. Caching, fetching.. is done in the EditingContext. Could you explain what will be the difference ?
 <div align="right"><a href="http://blog.ianbicking.org/comment662.html" rel="nofollow">#</a> <a href="http://www.larsen-b.com">Jkx</a></div><hr noshade>
 I'm not planning on taking the EditingContext from Modeling wholesale, it just happens to be a good metaphor.  The actual API will probably be significantly different.  And, in some cases (like getting and storing objects) I specifically don't plan to do it like Modeling.
<br />

<br />
The actual API I will implement?  I don't know, I haven't figured that out yet ;)
 <div align="right"><a href="http://blog.ianbicking.org/comment663.html" rel="nofollow">#</a> Ian Bicking</div><hr noshade>
 Can ID be compound object?  For example for replication I can create primary key 
<br />
(DB_instance_ID, row_ID).  SLQObject can work with such table?
 <div align="right"><a href="http://blog.ianbicking.org/comment664.html" rel="nofollow">#</a> dvb</div><hr noshade>
 Greetings - I just cooked up my first example objects with the current .5x stream of SQLObject and was nicely rewarded. I love the table schema generation - one of the things I've always loathed was maintaining the table/object mapping metadata in two different places. 
<br />

<br />
I'm really shocked at how liberating this is! ;)
<br />

<br />
I've done a number low to middle complexity solutions using "ORM" (tuxweb.de) as well as Titus Brown's Cucumber solution (which makes elegant use of Postgresql inheritance, but is therefore not portable to other systems. I rather like the API in SQLObject; a quick comparison of current performance shows it to be somewhat more efficient at some common tasks, and easy to side step when required.
<br />

<br />
Just going to check out the new work in subversion and see how that compares.

For the extra table information, I think it would also be useful to have a way to change the Character Set.  I'm not sure if that is included in InnoDB, but I thought I'd mention it just in case.</div>
