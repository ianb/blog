        <div class="document">
            <p>
                A while back I
                <a class="reference" href="fixing-apache-authentication.html"
                    >talked about Apache authentication</a
                >, with the hope that people would suggest some alternatives.
                And they did, and for the last week or two I've been trying to
                figure out what to do. To recap, my goals:
            </p>
            <ul class="simple">
                <li>
                    Centralize all identification at the Apache level, not at
                    the level of individual applications.
                </li>
                <li>Not use HTTP Basic authentication, which I hate.</li>
                <li>
                    Not use any specific authentication/identification backend;
                    we authenticate different users for different clients in
                    different ways.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Hopefully make it possible to use across servers/domains,
                    even if it takes a bit of fiddling. IIS support is nice,
                    just in case, but integrating with other people's systems
                    (and we don't use IIS internally) is always a messy
                    situation, so even with IIS support we can't expect too
                    much.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Anyway, a couple things were suggested. The first I looked at
                was
                <a class="reference" href="http://pubcookie.org">Pubcookie</a>,
                out of the University of Washington. Supports Apache 1.3 and 2,
                and IIS. Very focused on secure single-signon across a large
                network. Universities typically have lots of systems
                administered by very different groups, and often don't have a
                high degree of shared trust. And every year there's a new batch
                of students who learn about network sniffing. But this isn't
                exactly my situation, but it seemed like sufficient overlap.
            </p>
            <p>
                But I got Pubcookie installed, which was a little confusing at
                times but not too bad. It has an undocumented
                <tt class="docutils literal"
                    ><span class="pre">verify_fork</span></tt
                >
                method which calls an external process, and this makes
                username/password authentication easily pluggable (but not IP
                authentication, for instance). It uses cookies, not HTTP Basic,
                and a series of redirects and a CGI script for the
                authentication process.
            </p>
            <p>
                But I've been hitting a number of walls, and I don't know how
                well it will work out. HTTPS is required for everything --
                essentially programming policy into the tool. I'm not super
                concerned about someone sniffing an authentication cookie that
                is going to time out anyway, so this restriction is a little
                annoying. Logout is really difficult to understand or implement
                -- I think something is possible there, but I can't figure out
                quite what that is. Also, there's a fair amount of Apache
                configuration to change permissions around -- again, I may be
                able to get around that using conventions, but that's
                considerable added complexity (and I don't ultimately want to
                reconfigure Apache very often). And finally the installation is
                rather complicated; considering we're going to have a distinct
                installation for every client, and that installation includes an
                extra keyserver (who's purpose I don't quite understand) and a
                set of configuration files and several SSL keys, this makes me
                uncomfortable.

                looked almost identical, but with nicer graphical design and
                poorer documentation. It also comes out of a university.

                was also suggested, but it took me a while to get around to
                looking at it. This looks much more promising to me -- it's
                fairly simple, and consists only of the identification portion.
                It documents the cookies you have to set for authentication (and
                provides a sample implementation, I think, but the documents are
                more than enough for me). It doesn't have multi-server
                single-signon out of the box, but it's not hard to figure out
                how that would be set up (basically a set of redirects to get
                the browser to visit all appropriate domains). It even has room
                for extra data, like user roles. It's all based on a shared
                secret (with signed cookies, I believe), but that's 100% okay
                for our situation (but probably wouldn't be for Pubcookie).
            </p>
            <p>
                The real bummer for me is that it's for Apache 1.3 only. I see
                evidence of Apache 2 ports (<tt class="docutils literal"
                    ><span class="pre">mod_auth_tkt/2.0.0b1</span></tt
                >
                in Apache identification strings), but none that are publically
                available. That's really frustrating. It's another one of those
                projects that isn't developed openly (public repository, mailing
                list, etc), which has been frustrating me often lately -- open
                source without open development is a terrible waste. Personally
                I don't have the C or Apache module skills to resolve this, but
                if we go forward with this we'd probably be willing to pay
                someone who does.
            </p>
            <p>
                I also looked at
                <a
                    class="reference"
                    href="http://mod-auth-script.sourceforge.net/"
                    >mod_auth_script</a
                >, which is kind of interesting (though also largely abandoned).
                It's got even less policy than mod_auth_tkt. I haven't tried it,
                but I think you just configure an authentication URL (probably
                internal), like
                <tt class="docutils literal"
                    ><span class="pre">/auth_script.cgi</span></tt
                >
                -- on every request that gets run, and it outputs special
                headers that indicate who, if anyone, is logged in. You could
                implement a signed cookie authentication, or IP-based
                authentication, or anything on top of this. My only desire would
                be the ability to add other environmental variables (e.g.,
                <tt class="docutils literal"
                    ><span class="pre">REMOTE_USER_GROUPS</span></tt
                >). Essentially it would become a generic hook which didn't
                involve mod_*. There's an
                <a
                    class="reference"
                    href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&amp;aid=778283&amp;group_id=27856&amp;atid=391749"
                    >Apache 2 patch</a
                >, but unfortunately I'm not sure how much I trust any of it in
                its unmaintained state.
            </p>
            <p>
                I'm still shocked at how hard this is. 60% of the web servers
                out there use Apache. This is a really, really useful feature,
                and something I see people struggling with <em>everywhere</em>.
                And yet I mostly see the <em>remnants</em> of work to solve
                this, not a single robust solution or community of developers.
                We don't need another mod_auth_another_stupid_backend. I feel
                like I <em>must</em> be missing something?!? Sigh. Any other
                feedback is very welcome (and I'll report back on this yet
                again, no doubt).

            <div class="document">
                <p>
                    We had much the same situation within a tomcat-hosted
                    application. It had to support instantaneous detection of
                    changing user privileges and authenticate against ldap,
                    rdbms, and flatfile resources. I was astonished to find that
                    there was no library already out there to do this; it seems
                    like a pretty common need. I ended up writing a java Filter
                    class to do the work of intercepting requests and checking
                    whether they were authenticated; if not we send them to
                    whatever resource is appropriate for authentication (a login
                    form or a client cert in our case). Two small support
                    classes solved the 'check arbitrary backend' issue.

                    <p>
                        We addressed efficiency by updating a MRU role cache in
                        memory. Adding a bit of code to update the cache
                        externally from events (like deleting an Employee from
                        an ldap server) took care of the last part. It works
                        very well and I never saw the horrible performance hit I
                        expected from filtering every request. (This situation
                        is why I asked you whether WebWare had filters).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Apache 2.0 has protocol Filters, which allow you to do
                        the same thing (they're not as well documented, though).
                        I can't see why the same approach wouldn't work well
                        enough; you should be able to call the various mod_auth
                        backends to do the real work, ending up with a sort of
                        mod_meta_auth I guess.

                        This is how people tend to do it... but it only works in
                        one environment. Which is one of several reasons there's
                        so much pressure to have a homogenous environment. But I
                        think it should be resolvable, at least on the Apache
                        level, without binding it to any particular language or
                        programming environment.

                    Are you trying to do authentication (checking that someone
                    is who they say they are) or authorization (checking if user
                    x is allowed to look at this) or both? If you're just trying
                    to get the authentication managed in a single place,
                    authen.py looks most of the way there to me (although it is
                    hugely open to replay attacks unless you're changing the
                    secret every hour or so; I'd add an expiry time and IP to
                    the cookie and sign them with the secret too). If you're
                    doing authorization, the implementation in authen.py doesn't
                    seem the greatest, since you probably want more complicated
                    rules. So where do you want to write the rules? Does each
                    page/application manage its own authorization (assuming it
                    can get an authenticated username), or do you want to store
                    the authorization rules in apache's config file
                    (&quot;require valid-user&quot;), or somewhere else entirely
                    (like a database)?
                </p>
                <p>
                    When I needed SSO for Apache2, I did pretty much the same
                    thing as your authen.py, except I made it as an authen
                    handler instead of a header parser and used req.requires()
                    to let me be a bit more Apache-like in the config file (I
                    also had an analogue of groups in my login system):
                </p>
                <div class="line-block">
                    <div class="line">PythonAuthenHandler mysso</div>
                    <div class="line">
                        AuthType foobar # I recall having an AuthType (even a
                        made up one) was necessary for anything to happen
                    </div>
                    <div class="line">Require valid-user</div>
                    <div class="line-block">
                        <div class="line">or Require user bob</div>
                        <div class="line">or Require group payingCustomers</div>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <p>
                    So, the script handled both authentication and
                    authorization, although the actual authorization rules were
                    contained in Apache's config/.htaccess files. All the
                    handler had to do was check that the cookie contained valid
                    info (expiry time hadn't passed and wasn't too far in the
                    future, user's ip was the same as the cookie-contained ip,
                    and hash(username+group+expiration+ip+secret) matched the
                    signature) and only shoved the username into req.user if it
                    was valid. If req.requires() returned anything, it would
                    also do authorization and check that whatever req.requires
                    returned was true (groups matched or the username matched or
                    in the case of valid_user, the username had been set).
                </p>
                <p>
                    As to handling a lack of valid authorization, I just used a
                    straight-up 307 Redirect, ignoring the 401 code -- if you
                    aren't using http-based authentication, there's no point in
                    sending 401. When a user wasn't logged in, it would redirect
                    (returning apache.HTTP_TEMPORARY_REDIRECT) to the login page
                    like
                    <a
                        class="reference"
                        href="https://SecureLoginSite.InSameDomain/login?from=protectedPagesURL"
                        >https://SecureLoginSite.InSameDomain/login?from=protectedPagesURL</a
                    >. Obviously, the login form would redirect back to
                    protectedPagesURL after the user logged in and got the
                    (domain-wide) login cookie. If everything was okay, I set
                    req.user to username (which seemed to be all I ever needed;
                    I'm not sure what advantage writing a fake Authorization
                    header gets you, unless it's part of some further
                    authorization step) and returned apache.OK, which let the
                    page load normally.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The only problems with it were that it didn't gracefully
                    handle POSTs to its protected area (ideally it would encode
                    the POSTed data into the login URL and send a 303 See Other
                    to redirect to the login URL, and when the login URL
                    redirected back to it, rewrite the request into a POST with
                    the encoded data) and presumably it didn't perform overly
                    well, but that was never too important to me (it didn't have
                    a great deal of load on it; heck, I was getting away with
                    opening a file and reading the secret key from it on every
                    request!) I also didn't like the way that everything was in
                    trusted cookies which could be stolen, but if you restrict
                    the expiry time to something resonable and track the IP it
                    is at least somewhat safe.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So, not general-purpose or easily dropped-in (since it
                    required a custom login app which pulls up the groups the
                    user belongs to, checks the password is right, creates a
                    cookie, redirects, etc.), but it worked for me. Ideally, of
                    course, you'd use Kerberos as an HTTP authentication method,
                    but good luck finding browser support for that, and I
                    suppose the user would have to remember to login as
                    <a
                        class="reference"
                        href="mailto:username&#37;&#52;&#48;yourwebsite&#46;com"
                        >username<span>&#64;</span>yourwebsite<span>&#46;</span>com</a
                    >
                    which might be a bit unintuitive.

                    <p>
                        Hmm... well, authentication and authorization are always
                        hard for me to keep track of. Lets call it
                        identification and authorization.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The system has to support several possible techniques.
                        For instance, some portions of the website are served up
                        as static files directly, so Apache authorization needs
                        to be used (<tt class="docutils literal"
                            ><span class="pre">require</span>
                            <span class="pre">valid-user</span></tt
                        >
                        or something), or some Apache module that gives a richer
                        set of controls. But web applications often have
                        shifting and eclectic permissions, so I don't want to
                        use Apache to control those permissions (or at least not
                        require that).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        One reason I don't like 307 is because (a) programs that
                        already expect
                        <tt class="docutils literal"
                            ><span class="pre">REMOTE_USER</span></tt
                        >
                        usually respond with 401 (and I want to provide
                        <tt class="docutils literal"
                            ><span class="pre">REMOTE_USER</span></tt
                        >), and (b) the details of the redirect are best
                        understood by Apache, not the individual applications.
                        But if I have to use a redirect, I'll probably put the
                        redirect location in an environmental variable, to at
                        least keep the configuration centralized.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The POST thing is clearly a problem. It's one of many
                        usability issues that POST proponents ignore. Obviously
                        a POST-understanding redirector would be nice.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        One of the advantages of a signed cookie is that
                        identification happens once, and need not be efficient,
                        and only the cookie verification happens on subsequent
                        requests (which ought to be quite fast). But I'd like
                        this all in C (which is what tkt offers) instead of
                        mod_python, in part because mod_python is challenging to
                        maintain in its own right, and not Apache 1.3
                        compatible.

                    authentication!!!) and you can put the passwords and users

                    Perhaps you ought to look more closely at cosign. I might
                    say that it has less documentation than pubcookie because
                    there's much less to document. Certainly it addresses some
                    of the issues you're complaining about: it doesn't require
                    HTTPS, logout is simple, installing the filter is quite
                    easy. Good luck!

                    Interesting site, it is well written. Registration not so
                    was pleasant, and with scripts of a problem. Let&amp;#039;s
                    vary references, or banners. Write, how solve
