<div class="document">
<p>Well, it took a while, but I finally finished my first experiment with <a class="reference" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AJAX">Ajax</a> (aka Asynchronous Javascript and XML; i.e., DHTML revisited).  It actually doesn't use XML, but I guess it uses XMLHttpRequest, so that's good enough.</p>
<p>Sadly I cannot demo it for you all, but you can run it on your own with <a class="reference" href="http://pythonpaste.org">Paste</a>; it's at <a class="reference" href="http://svn.pythonpaste.org/Paste/trunk/examples/console">http://svn.pythonpaste.org/Paste/trunk/examples/console</a> -- it gives you an interface similar to the interactive interpreter in Python (obviously not secure for the public web!).  When you enter a command, it sends it to the server (as a URL-encode POST request at the moment), and the server returns any output (including the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">repr</span></tt> of any expression, the way the interactive interpreter does).  I used code from <a class="reference" href="http://python.org/doc/current/lib/module-doctest.html">doctest</a> as a model for <a class="reference" href="http://svn.pythonpaste.org/Paste/trunk/examples/console/evalcontext.py">evalcontext</a>, which implements the actual interpreter part.  Everything gets interpreted in the server process, so potentially it's a debugging tool.  I can imagine lots of ways to improve it for debugging -- things like HTML object inspectors -- but this is just a minimal experiment at this point.  Or other similar tools, like something similar to <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">tail</span></tt> that shows an ongoing list of log messages.  (Paste first needs a logging system, though -- based on <a class="reference" href="http://python.org/doc/current/lib/module-logging.html">logging</a> of course, but made more convenient)</p>
<p>In theory you could even hook up <a class="reference" href="http://python.org/doc/current/lib/module-pdb.html">pdb</a> to this kind of system and debug exceptions.  That would be neat.  Not that I actually use pdb that often, but I feel like I should.  Right now post-mortem debugging is generally more useful to me, and with good post-mortem debugging the interactive work isn't as hard.  I still need to add <a class="reference" href="http://python.org/doc/current/lib/module-cgitb.html">cgitb</a>-like capturing of local variables.  But I can imagine an entirely different error middleware (different than <a class="reference" href="http://svn.pythonpaste.org/Paste/trunk/paste/error_middleware.py">this</a>) that implements the debugger.  Parallel development of these things is part of what I hope to see from WSGI.</p>
<p>Thinking about it, it doesn't even seem that hard.  You catch an execption.  You get <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">sys.exc_info()</span></tt>, which contains all the frames from the exception, and thus contains all the local variables.  You show a traceback.  You have something like this interactive console, but you also let the user select a frame from the traceback, so that their statements will be executed in that scope.  And there you have a pretty neat little debugging environment.  Fun.  But... must... not... get... distracted...</p>
<p>I used <a class="reference" href="http://jsolait.net">Javascript O Lait</a> for the Javascript.  I tried using <a class="reference" href="http://www.json-rpc.org/">JSON-RPC</a> (via <a class="reference" href="http://jsolait.net/doc/jsonrpc.xhtml">ServerProxy</a> and <a class="reference" href="http://svn.pythonpaste.org/Paste/trunk/examples/console/JSONComponent/">JSONComponent</a>), but it was too slow for some reason.  I'll figure that why later.  So in the end I just used <a class="reference" href="http://jsolait.net/doc/urllib.xhtml">urllib</a>, which is a fairly thin wrapper around <a class="reference" href="http://developer.apple.com/internet/webcontent/xmlhttpreq.html">XMLHttpRequest</a>.  I've looked at <a class="reference" href="http://dojotoolkit.org/">Dojo</a>, which seems simple but doesn't seem to have any useable documentation and the download is huge and confusing.  I looked at <a class="reference" href="http://sarissa.sourceforge.net/doc/">Sarissa</a>, but it's mostly about XML, and XML is the least interesting part of Ajax to me.  I looked at <a class="reference" href="http://www.modernmethod.com/sajax/">Sajax</a>, but it's a little too clever with the server-side stuff for me.  I want to develop the server-side integration myself, in whatever way makes best sense for the framework.  But it probably deserves a bit more attention; it's the next closest in scope to what I'm interested in.</p>
<p>Dang, that's a lot of links.  Well, there's my link dump for ya'.</p>

<p>Sigh, the site is down now.  Well, I looked at it before, and it looks quite cool, integrating a richer shell than the one I dug out of doctest into the browser (PyShell...?)</p>

<p>cherryshell still there 
now version 0.2 ;)
<a class="reference" href="http://john.thetrotter.net">http://john.thetrotter.net</a></p>
<p>Anyway site goes down sometimes when i am doing changes. But is will come back :)</p>
<p>Also there is pyroshell (remote pyshell with pyro) not really usefull but 
proof of concept</p>
<p>site goes up and down because I do changes.</p>
<p>cherryshell 0.2 is quirky but works and is cool (lol me prejudiced)
it quirk thought.</p>
<p>I need to make gui class for javascript. Working on that then will release 0.3</p>

<p>I think (no benchmarking) that jsonrpc with jsolait is quicker then xmlrpc.</p>
<p>I was using it on project that fall through :(. To get results from a db and give them back to user.</p>
<p>approx size of db 10,000 and results where like 300. It could fetch them in less then 1 second, plus page do not have to be regened.</p>
<p>When I use xmlrpc it was slower 1.5 sec.</p>
<p>I have crappy virtual server.</p>
<p>I was thinking of making a debugger, with same idea, but the client browser would have to poll the server.
(I do not think with javascript there is a way to send result to client, without client initiating the request).</p>
<p>I do not understand why in your case jsonrpc slow</p>
