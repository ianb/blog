                So, now that I'm
                <a
                    class="reference"
                    href="https://ianbicking.org/starting-with-selenium.html?"
                    >using Selenium</a
                >
                (well, planning to), I'm thinking about
                <a class="reference" href="http://imagescape.com">our</a>
                all-around testing system. There's unit testing -- but that's
                not web-specific so I won't talk about that here.
            </p>
            <p>
                Selenium seems good for acceptance and cross-browser testing.
                Hopefully with the right toolset even non-programmers can start
                building and running testing scripts on applications.
            </p>
            <p>
                There's also a &quot;Driven&quot; mode for Selenium -- basically
                a process drives the Selenium Javascript code. I'm not 100%
                clear on how the communication is done, but anyway. If your
                Selenium test looks like:
            </p>
            <table border class="table">
                <colgroup>
                    <col width="42%" />
                    <col width="56%" />
                    <col width="2%" />
                </colgroup>
                <tbody valign="top">
                    <tr>
                        <td>open</td>
                        <td>http://myhost.com/app</td>
                        <td>&nbsp;</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>click</td>
                        <td>//a[text()-'Next']</td>
                        <td>&nbsp;</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>verifyTextPresent</td>
                        <td>Page 2</td>
                        <td>&nbsp;</td>
                    </tr>
                </tbody>
            </table>
            <p>Then your drive code might look like:</p>
            <pre class="literal-block">
selenium.open('http://myhost.com')
selenium.click(&quot;//a[text()='Next']&quot;)
selenium.verifyTextPresent('Page 2')
</pre
            >
            <p>
                And you could put that in
                <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">unittest</span></tt
                >-based tests or whatever. I'm not that excited about that --
                driving browsers on an unattended basis seems like a bit of a
                pain. Which perhaps is where
                <a
                    class="reference"
                    href="http://issola.caltech.edu/~t/twill/README.html"
                    >Twill</a
                >
                fits in -- in fact, Twill could even take something looking very
                much like Seleniums commands, and provide extra value like HTML
                validation, link checking, performance testing, etc., all in a
                more controlled environment. More than just a place for both, I
                see them working in concert.
            </p>
            <p>
                But two testing strategies don't provide a tripod of stability,
                and metaphorical stability is top on my list.
            </p>
            <p>
                So the third testing strategy is to make sure the applications
                are happily humming away when they are live and no one is
                looking at them. I don't think it's reasonable to run acceptance
                tests on live applications -- too much valuable state. So
                instead I want to start adding self-diagnostic code to those
                applications. This code will check database connections, make
                sure files are all in place, etc. Even just a &quot;yes I'm
                alive&quot; response is a big improvement over nothing. Each of
                these will be a page, in an out-of-the-way location.
            </p>
            <p>
                Then we point a monitoring daemon at it. I like the look of
                <a class="reference" href="http://www.kernel.org/software/mon/"
                    >Mon</a
                >, but our sysadmin has experience with
                <a class="reference" href="http://www.bb4.org/">Big Brother</a>.
                So I'm not sure exactly what we'll use (opinions welcome).
                Either way, I want all of our applications to be pinged on a
                regular basis, with notification of problems. This will turn
                into a total system check -- if the network is down, if Apache
                is down, or if our application server is down, we'll get a
                report.
            </p>
            <p>
                But wait, that is not all! No tripod is complete without a
                fourth leg! The last part is handling all exceptions, no matter
                who triggers them. Webware can email all exceptions to you --
                nice, and easy to configure. We have something ad hoc that does
                the same in Zope -- a bit ugly and not so easy (what's up with
                that?!), but it's there. I'm working on a refinement here as
                well; it won't apply to every system we have -- it can't be in
                place on a PHP application, for instance -- but it's an
                exception reporter that can be used outside of a web context,
                while providing all the contextual information that both Webware
                and Zope's error reports have. It can also work on background
                tasks, like cron jobs and scheduled tasks. Extra information
                (beyond the normal traceback) is important for post-mortem
                debugging, and so that no error -- no matter how small! -- will
                go forgotten.

                I'd suggest taking a hard, hard look at Nagios for monitoring.
                I'll admit to not using Mon since 2000, but the Nagois (well, it
                was called Netsaint then) installation that replaced Mon proved
                itself to be insanely more configurable, more scalable, and more
                flexible. Mon's probably gotten better in the last 4 years, but
                then so has Nagios.

                <p>
                    I concur with the previous poster about Nagios. I've been
                    using it for a long time and it's extremely stable and
                    non-obtrusive. It only sends mail when there really is
                    something going on with the server. I'll send you a URL you
                    can check out for yourself.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As for &quot;holistic&quot; testing for your Web site, I
                    suggest a 5th leg :-) ... performance/load/stress testing.
                    One approach that worked for me was to blast the Web site
                    via some load tool (I've used siege, httperf, and more
                    recently openload), while actively monitoring the servers
                    (Web/DB) via either 1) command line utilities such as top,
                    vmstat, iostat, etc. or 2) SNMP (I configured net-snmp on
                    each server and then queried the servers for all kinds of
                    things like memory, CPU, disk, number of processes etc.).
                    This way you can see where to tweak your servers for better
                    performance. Of course, you can also run your Web app
                    through a profiler while this is going on, to detect
                    bottlenecks in your code; same thing for your DB.

                Actually a 6th leg is security testing. You can use a
                general-purpose security scanner such as nessus, or a
                HTTP-specific scanner such as N-Stealth, nikto, whisker and many
                others. In fact, you gave me an idea for a future post :-)
