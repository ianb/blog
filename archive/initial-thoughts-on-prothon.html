                looks quite interesting. Reading through the
                <a
                    class="reference"
                    href="http://www.prothon.org/description.htm"
                    >description</a
                >, here are a few of my thoughts.
            </p>
            <div class="section" id="line-continuations">
                <h1><a name="line-continuations">Line Continuations</a></h1>
                <p>
                    Prothon uses whitespace for continuations, so if a line is
                    indented from the previous line it is considered a
                    continuation of that line. I have a really hard time keeping
                    lines under 80 characters in width, and
                    <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">\</span></tt> and
                    <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">()</span></tt> always
                    break up my coding -- the first is ugly, and the second
                    requires me to back up to the beginning of the line once I
                    realize I'm going over 80 characters.
                </p>
                <p>This is purely syntactic, Python could also do this.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="section" id="with-keyword">
                <h1><a name="with-keyword">&quot;with&quot; keyword</a></h1>
                <p>
                    This is really at the heart of Prothon. This is actually my
                    plan for OO in
                    <a class="reference" href="http://pylogo.org">PyLogo</a>
                    (except it's called
                    <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">TELL</span></tt>
                    there). When you use
                    <tt class="literal"
                        ><span class="pre">with</span>
                        <span class="pre">var:</span></tt
                    >,
                    <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">var</span></tt>
                    becomes the &quot;self&quot; object (though Prothon doesn't
                    use the word &quot;self&quot;).
                </p>
                <p>
                    This kind of scares me, though. My experience with DTML
                    shows that this is a horrible feature. Though, that said,
                    I'm not sure if
                    <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">with</span></tt> is
                    quite as dangerous as
                    <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">dtml-with</span></tt>
                    -- so long as it only applies locally it's not too bad. The
                    issue would be something like:
                </p>
                <pre class="literal-block">
with File:
    def .writeAll(*objs):
        for ob in objs:
           .write(CustString(ob))

def CustString(ob):
    if .filename.endswith('.txt'):
        ob = Str(obj)
    else:
        ob = Str(obj).encode('UTF-8')
</pre
                >
                <p>
                    I don't know, I'm kind of contriving that example. But the
                    question being, do you &quot;inherit&quot; the
                    <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">.</span></tt> (self)
                    according to call order? Or only statically? Eh, they
                    probably do the right (static only) thing here.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="section" id="def-with-expressions">
                <h1><a name="def-with-expressions">def with expressions</a></h1>
                <p>Or, more specifically, something like:</p>
                <pre class="literal-block">
def Point.move(xofs, yofs): ...
</pre
                >
                <p>
                    In this case, adding a method
                    <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">move</span></tt> to
                    <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">Point</span></tt
                    >. I like this, it's very natural feeling. It is used to
                    more effect in Prothon than it would be in normal Python.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="section" id="variable-naming">
                <h1><a name="variable-naming">Variable naming</a></h1>
                <p>
                    In Prothon, locals start with lower-case letters or the
                    underscore, and globals are capitalized. This is okay. I
                    still like lower-case functions, but I can live with
                    upper-case functions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I do <em>not</em> like all the prefixes they come up with. I
                    think this is clearly a case of starting with one or two
                    prefixes, then it spiraling out of control. Here's the
                    prefixes:
                </p>
                <table border class="table">
                    <colgroup>
                        <col width="12%" />
                        <col width="88%" />
                    </colgroup>
                    <thead valign="bottom">
                        <tr>
                            <th>Prefix</th>
                            <th>Meaning</th>
                        </tr>
                    </thead>
                    <tbody valign="top">
                        <tr>
                            <td>
                                <tt class="literal"
                                    ><span class="pre">.</span></tt

                            </td>
                            <td>
                                <tt class="literal"
                                    ><span class="pre">.x</span></tt
                                >
                                is like
                                <tt class="literal"
                                    ><span class="pre">self.x</span></tt
                                >, kind of. Problem:
                                <tt class="literal"
                                    ><span class="pre">.</span></tt

                                can't be pronounced, and it's really small. I
                                still like
                                <tt class="literal"
                                    ><span class="pre">self</span></tt
                                >, though I can understand taking it out of
                                method signatures. I think they should make
                                <tt class="literal"
                                    ><span class="pre">self</span></tt
                                >
                                a keyword.

                                Like &quot;super&quot;, though the exact
                                equivalent in Python is terribly confusing (the
                                <tt class="literal"

                                function). I'm used to it from Smalltalk, and
                                like the brevity compared to Python's standard
                                mechanism. A
                                <tt class="literal"

                                keyword would still be better (to go with a

                                This is a closure variable -- a variable that is
                                defined in the parent scope. Anyone who has
                                tried Scheme-style closures in Python has
                                probably known the suffering of trying to figure
                                out how scopes work. This makes it very
                                explicit, which actually makes it usable. I also
                                imagine it makes it easier to implement, since
                                you actually know which variables need to be
                                kept with the closure. Horrible punctuation, but
                                a good idea.

                                Dynamic local variables. There's no equivalent
                                in Python -- you'd have to open up the current
                                frame object and look in parent scopes. While
                                it's expedient, I think it's also a very bad
                                idea to provide this. That kind of mucking about
                                with parent scopes is just asking for problems.
                                I guess it could be used to macro-like effect in
                                some ways.

                    allows for more playing around than in Python -- you can
                    return an object besides self and effect the result of the
                    constructor. Of course, you've already constructed the
                    object anyway, so maybe
                    <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">__new__</span></tt>
                    really is called for, if you actually want to avoid creating
                    an object. (If you had to call
                    <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">^__init__</span></tt>
                    to construct the object, then it would be more general)
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the list of little tweaks, they also allow identifiers to
                    contain <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">!</span></tt
                    >, with the usual meaning (indicating the method mutates the
                    object). I always like that punctuation, so I like that it's
                    in there. It's much more useful than Python's convention of
                    returning None -- I can tell statically that a method name
                    contains <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">!</span></tt
                    >, but I can't do the same for returning None, and returning
                    None is annoying. Prothon also returns self by default,
                    instead of returning None (there's some conflicting
                    information on this, so they might not be doing this). I
                    like <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">?</span></tt> in
                    identifiers as well, but Prothon doesn't add that.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There also seems to be a tendency to global methods, like
                    <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">obj.chr()</span></tt>
                    instead of
                    <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">str(obj)</span></tt
                    >. I'm not entirely clear about this -- I think it falls out
                    of the way builtins are defined. I generally prefer Python's
                    style with magic methods, purely from an aesthetic point of
                    view, though I can understand why some people would prefer
                    using methods for everything.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There's also some changes in generators, but I haven't used
                    generators enough to have an opinion on the subject. I think
                    the change is fairly significant, from a stylistic/usage
                    point of view.

                <p>
                    It's an interesting effort. There are some small
                    aesthetic/syntactic changes, some of which I like and some
                    of which I don't. Then there's the prototypes... which are
                    something else entirely.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I actually wonder to what degree prototypes could be
                    implemented in Python with metaclasses. While some of the
                    syntax would currently be crufy with Python (e.g., you'd
                    have to create a function, then assign the function to an
                    object), that's kind of a separate issue. The basic object
                    model in Python feels like it should be replaceable,
                    especially since we already have both new and old style
                    classes. I think it's still a bit hard to think about these
                    with the syntax getting in the way or otherwise being
                    distracting, but feel like the potential is in there
                    somewhere.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If it could be hacked onto Python instead of developed
                    entirely separately from Python, it could make Prothon much
                    more interesting from the perspective of practical
                    programming. Ultimately it would probably have to be like

                    -- a patch against Python implementing some necessary
                    changes to syntax. But that's a more viable development
                    effort, and one that's more likely to percolate ideas into
                    the main Python interpreter.

            I checked out your comments thinking you'd certainly have a reaction
            to the elimination of the GIL. *That* is what caught my attention
            regarding Prothon.
            <br />

            <br />
            I seem to remember you saying you don't think the GIL is much of a
            design flaw. I do. I'm very interested to see if this really might
            be the end of the GIL. Preferably in Python. I see the GIL as the #1
            weakness in Python. For me, at least, with access to machines with
            16 processors.

            The GIL needs to stay as-is if Python is going to be reasonably
            programmable at the C API. It would also make Python a lot slower,
            and it would break just about every extension... neither of which it
            needs. A GIL-free Python is going to have to wait until something
            smarter comes along, like PyPy, which could just automatically
            parallelize your code if it makes sense to do so.
            <br />

            <br />
            If you have 16 processors, use 16 processes. You'll do fine. With
            shared memory on a decent kernel, the only real latency you'll see
            is going to be your fault ;)

            PyPy already sounded cool. If it can eliminate the GIL or find
            anothre route to SMP performance then it's just that much better.
            Cool.
            <br />

            <br />
            I do read often that the GIL must stay. But what about Java? No GIL
            there. I'v even converted Python to Jython, switched to Java threads
            and, wow, it works great. Of course, only on a JVM. But doesn't that
            show the way for CPython developers? (If Sun can do it...) And I
            guess Prothon might also show the way if it suceeds.
            <br />

            <br />
            Until the GIL is gone from CPython I feel like Java is still ahead,
            which is depressing. It's hard for me to honestly persuade Java
            programers to try CPython so long as there's a GIL.

            Have you ever compared Java's performance for Python-style data
            structures like lists (Vectors) and dictionaries (Hashtables)? It's
            just a guess, but I think you'll find that Python's structures beat
            the snot out of Java's, because Python's don't require synchronized
            methods. They're implicitly synchronized by the GIL. Whereas Java
            objects need to have locks around each method call.
            <br />

            <br />
            For Java, this is acceptable *only* because vectors and hashtables
            aren't on the critical path for performance. Java object fields are
            accessed using fixed offsets. In Python, those structures are used
            for *everything* (including all attribute lookups and use of
            globals), so adding item-specific synchronization kills Python
            performance dead dead dead. There was a guy who actually made a
            version of Python without the GIL, and it was "only" 50% SLOWER than
            Python with the GIL.

            <br />
            Prototypes could certainly be implemented in current Python (I think
            that Lulu Lotus Eater IBM guy posted something on the Slashdot story
            about it), but it's a bit like asking to implement OOP in C.

            On the subject of the GIL again: I think it would be far, far more
            interesting to make multiple-process Python programs easier to write
            -- to make interprocess communication seemless, and just generally
            to establish robust (and easy to use!) patterns for that kind of
            programming. The benefits would far excede the benefits of mere SMP
            threading performance. But even right now, I imagine it's way easier
            to write a multi-process Python program than a threaded Java
            program.

            Personally, I think that pre-emptive threads with the same object
            space is THE WRONG PARADIGM ANYWAY. It makes for impossible to
            predict and debug code, thread locks suck, doesn't cooperate with
            event systems like GUIs, etc. I'm willing to bet that much higher
            performance and reliability can be attained with something else that
            is actually easier to code (something else that doesn't exist for a
            Python-like-language yet). Processes (pre-emptive switching between
            separate execution contexts that can be explicitly parallelized to
            multiple CPUs) and stackless-like tasklets (task switching in a
            single execution context) are the best we can currently do in
            Python, live with it, it's not going to change.

            Everything I keep reading and hearing about repeats the theme that
            threads are an accident that came from people trying to "perfect"
            processes and thus making them too slow. Threading is way too hard
            and there are no indications that it will continue to be anything
            but a dead end. Other forms of concurrency, especially ones that are
            more OO and that remove problems like deadlock and race conditions,
            are much more preferable.

            <br />
            For me threads are much simpler to use than forking processes and,
            for example, using xmlrpclib for inter-thread communication. I've
            done both, and God bless xmlrpclib, but processes are still tedious
            compared to simple, almost magical, threads.
            <br />

            <br />
            Did you mean hard to use or hard to build into the language? Even
            CPython already gives access to real native threads. I have to keep
            reminding myself of that. It's just the GIL design that kills (not
            just 2X, more like 10X) potential performance. I have a Jython
            thread demo that run circles around CPython. Of course, only with
            multiple CPUs.

            On another note ... I haven't seen anyone upset at the potential
            that alternative Python implementations like Prothon have to
            fragment the Python user base. People are already talking about the
            profileration of web frameworks in Python ... what about when the
            language itself has 3-4 different implementations? Jython has a good
            reason for existence, but much of Prothon's design seems to be
            related to personal preference, not actual improvements.

            Prothon IS NOT PYTHON. Did you read the post?

            The problem is that under Windows, a process-switch takes a lot more
            times than a thread-switch.
            <br />
            So replacing a multi threaded prog by several processes
            communicating with some protocols is not as much a solution as it
            can be with, say, Linux (I don't know it, but I have been told that
            under Linux process ~ thread under Windows).
            <br />
            That's not to say it can't be done, but there are possibly more
            cases under windows where you have no other choice than using
            threads whereas you have the option under Linux to use a multi
            processes solution.
            <br />
            I wish processes were not so heavy with Windows: I made a lot of
            multi-threading programming until now, I know the problems it
            involves and how it can be frustrating to debug such programs !

            Prothon is close enough to Python (notice the spelling here) to
            consider it an alternative implementation in my mind. Except for the
            64-bit/threading issues which are a minor issue to most (wasn't this
            supposed to be a _simpler_ language??), the "big changes" of
            tabs/spaces, removal of self, and removal of classes/metaclasses is
            just noise. Why introduce another implementation that solves no
            apparent issues except syntax?

            Yes, of course, it's exactly the same except it has a totally
            different idea of scope, a completely different object system, and a
            fresh implementation intended for tomorrow's computers and very
            large problem sets. Come on :)

            ]] Dynamic local variables. There's no equivalent in Python -- you'd
            have to open up the current frame object and look in parent scopes.
            While it's expedient, I think it's also a very bad idea to provide
            this. That kind of mucking about with parent scopes is just asking
            for problems. I guess it could be used to macro-like effect in some
            ways. [[
            <br />

            <br />
            Actually aren't all local variables in Python dynamic?
            <br />

            <br />
            def func():
            <br />
            print x, y
            <br />

            <br />
            x = 1
            <br />
            y = 2
            <br />
            func()
            <br />

            <br />
            I agree that this is a really bad idea...

            I can almost guarantee that the process switching overhead in
            Windows is far less than the overhead that you get with the GIL...
            because guess what, two chunks of python code can NEVER EVER RUN AT
            THE SAME TIME with Python threads! :) It's only carefully written C
            code that can explicitly allow ONE python thread to run concurrently
            while it's doing something way outside of the Python domain.
            <br />

            <br />
            That said, I don't use Windows anymore, so I can't do a benchmark,
            but I think you are blowing the win32 process switching overhead out
            of proportion.

            Ah, thanks for clearing that up, Bob.
            <br />

            To the person who was complaining about process-switch... are you
            sure you're not talking about the slowness of
            <b>creating</b> processes vs. threads on Windows? (By "switch" I
            assume everyone is talking about context switching?)
