                This is a much more clever solution than simply

            Why is that Mozilla developers, who talk all day about how more
            standards-compliant their browser is, are purposely introducing
            non-standard behavior?
            <br />

            <br />
            Smarter than IE developers? No. More inconsistent than IE
            developers? Yes.

            Huh? There's nothing standards-uncompliant about this. When a URL is
            visited, Mozilla re-encodes it to an <i>exactly equivalent</i> URL
            (it's equivalent because of standards!), but one which cannot be
            maliciously abused, then displays that URL in the address bar. It's
            just a UI issue.

            Well, a lot of IE users don't have the address bar turned on. This
            was turned up by some usability survey - most people did not know
            what to do with a URL.

            Well, if someone doesn't have the address bar switched on, there's
            no need to go to the trouble of using usernames & passwords in the
            URL to fool them.
            <br />

            <br />
            Just send them HTML email with a link to
            <a href="http://evil.com/" target="_blank">http://evil.com/</a> and
            tell them its their bank. If they never see the URL at all, there's
            no need to do anything complicated to fool them.
            <br />

            <br />
            Sheesh, you can't save everyone from their own ignorance all of the
            time!
