</div><h1>The UnZen of UnPython</h1>
 
<div class="document">
<p>Chris McDonough is thinking about what <a class="reference" href="http://www.plope.com/Members/chrism/pythonic">Unpythonic means</a>, and he kind of
concludes that it's just a stick to beat other people over the head
with, that like &quot;obscenity&quot; it's just a vague term brought out to
invoke a response without being very explicit about what really
bothers you.</p>
<p>Probably true.  But then, I think &quot;Unpythonic&quot; really does mean
something.  So I thought I'd invert the Zen of Python (<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">import</span>
<span class="pre">this</span></tt>).</p>
<div class="section">

<p><em>An inverted version of the original by Tim Peters</em></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><strong>Ugly is better than beautiful</strong> <em>because there's no time to make it
beautiful, and beauty is just a matter of opinion</em>.</li>
<li><strong>Implicit is better than explicit</strong> <em>because explicit violates DRY</em>.</li>
<li><strong>Complex is better than simple</strong> <em>because no one needs a consultant to do
simple things</em></li>
<li><strong>Complicated is better than complex</strong> <em>because you don't want to
tie the developer to anything prematurely</em>.</li>
<li><strong>Nested is better than flat</strong> <em>because hierarchy keeps things organized</em>.</li>
<li><strong>Dense is better than sparse</strong> <em>because sparse wastes space and time</em>.</li>
<li><strong>Readability doesn't count</strong> <em>because personal expressiveness is more
important</em>.</li>
<li><strong>Special cases are special enough to break the rules</strong> <em>specialized
dialects let you better express your meaning</em>.</li>
<li><strong>Although purity beats practicality</strong> <em>because you only go around once,
you better do it right</em>.</li>
<li><strong>Errors should pass silently</strong> <em>because status return codes are more
explicit</em>.</li>
<li><strong>Unless explicitly raised</strong> <em>because unhandled exceptions cause
problems</em>.</li>
<li><strong>In the face of ambiguity, guess</strong> <em>because at least you'll be
matching</em> someone's <em>expectations, as opposed to</em> no one.</li>
<li><strong>There should be several obvious way to do it</strong> <em>because people think
in many different ways, and for each there should be a way that
matches their thought process</em>.</li>
<li><strong>Never is better than now</strong> <em>because we don't want to be rushed</em>.</li>
<li><strong>Although *right* now is often better than never</strong> <em>because we can
always change our minds</em>.</li>
<li><strong>If the implementation is easy to explain, it's a bad idea</strong> <em>because
then the programmer could have done it on their own, and we don't
need to add yet another idea to the system</em>.</li>
<li><strong>If the implementation is hard to explain, it may be a good idea</strong>
<em>because clearly something neat and magical is going on there</em>.</li>
<li><strong>Namespaces are a terrible idea, let's stop doing that</strong>
<em>because typing</em> <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">foo.bar</span></tt> <em>takes twice as much time and energy to type as</em> <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">bar</span></tt></li>
</ul>

<p>It's the UnZen because I also destroy any Zenness when I explain each
item.  No elegant koans here.  And I left out the Dutch one; I didn't
feel like picking on some arbitrarily chosen nationality.</p>
<p>But for just about each idea, it seems like there's someone or some
project that really does value the opposite idea.  They seem to fall
into two camps: the first several for cowboy coders and cowboy
languages (*coughperlcough*), and the second half are ivory tower
programmers and languages (*coughschemecough*).  Inverting the error
handling reminds me of <a class="reference" href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2003/10/13.html">this article</a>.  Complex
syntax and special cases reminds me of people who defend Perl as a
Huffman coding of programmer intent.  Just to name a few.</p>
<p>Anyway, food for thought.</p>

<p>This is great :).  I think I might have to go and retroactively remove my use of the word &quot;pythonic&quot; anywhere public, now...</p>
<p>Might I suggest a minor edit, though?  Since most of these seem semi-serious (or at least, I've heard most of them proposed by &quot;serious&quot; people), the &quot;namespaces&quot; one seems out of place...  how about:</p>

<p>Would it be Pythonic to expect claims of &quot;UnPythonic!&quot; to be supported by a Pythonic rewrite?  If the Pythonic rewrite were sufficiently Pythonic, any inflamatory claims accompanying the Pythonic rewrite could be ignored, or left out completely.</p>

<p>How wise... a bunch of a posteriori revisionists.</p>
<p>I would add: You can always write FORTRAN code in any language: Python is not inmune to that either.</p>

<p>Every Unpythonic idea can be done in Python, and I could probably come up with an example for each one too, but I'm not that into the exposition of bad code.  I'm sure I've done several of them myself.</p>
<p>It would be pretty boring to talk about &quot;Pythonic&quot; and &quot;Unpythonic&quot; if it just mean &quot;syntactically valid according to the Python interpreter&quot; or &quot;not valid&quot;.</p>
