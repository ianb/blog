                                    WARs on people&#8217;s minds), and in a lot
                                    of ways that installer is nice, but
                                    it&#8217;s also kind of wonky, it makes
                                    configuration unclear, it&#8217;s not always
                                    clear when it installs or configures itself
                                    through the web, and when you have to do
                                    this at the system level, nor is it clear
                                    where it puts files and data, etc. So a
                                    great initial experience doesn&#8217;t feel
                                    like a great ongoing experience to me
                                    &#8212; and
                                    <em>it doesn&#8217;t have to be that way</em
                                    >. If those were
                                    <em>necessary</em> compromises, sure, but
                                    they aren&#8217;t. And because we
                                    <em>don&#8217;t have</em> WAR files, if
                                    we&#8217;re proposing to make something new,
                                    then we have every opportunity to make
                                    things better.

                                    So the question then is what we&#8217;re
                                    trying to make. To me: we want applications
                                    that are easy to install, that are
                                    self-describing, self-configuring (or at
                                    least guide you through configuration),
                                    reliable with respect to their environment
                                    (not dependent on system tweaking),
                                    upgradable, and respectful of persistence
                                    (the data that outlives the application
                                    install). A lot of this can be done by the
                                    &quot;container&quot; (to use Java parlance;
                                    or &quot;environment&quot;) &#8212; if you
                                    just have the app packaged in a nice way,
                                    the container (server environment, hosting
                                    service, etc) can handle all the
                                    system-specific things to make the
                                    application actually work.

                                    project, which defines something very much
                                    like this. Silver Lining isn&#8217;t
                                    <em>just</em> an application format, and
                                    things aren&#8217;t fully extracted along
                                    these lines, but it&#8217;s pretty close and
                                    it addresses a lot of important issues in
                                    the lifecycle of an application. To be
                                    clear: Silver Lining is an application
                                    packaging format, a server configuration
                                    library, a cloud server management tool, a
                                    persistence management tool, and a tool to
                                    manage the application with respect to all
                                    these services over time. It is a bunch of
                                    things, maybe too many things, so it is not
                                    unreasonable to pick out a smaller subset to
                                    focus on. Maybe an easy place to start (and
                                    good for Silver Lining itself) would be to
                                    separate at least the application format
                                    (and tools to manage applications in that
                                    state, e.g., installing new libraries) from
                                    the tools that make use of such applications
                                    (deploy, etc).

                                    Some opinions I have on this format,
                                    exemplified in Silver Lining:
                                </p>

                                        It&#8217;s not zipped or a single file,
                                        unlike WARs. Uploading zip files is not
                                        a great API. Geez. I know there&#8217;s
                                        this desire to &quot;just drop in a
                                        file&quot;; but there&#8217;s no getting
                                        around the fact that &quot;dropping a
                                        file&quot; becomes a
                                        <em>deployment protocol</em>
                                        <strong>and</strong>
                                        <em

                                        git-based (ala Heroku) because

                                        But of course there isn&#8217;t really
                                        any deployment protocol inferred by a
                                        format anyway, so maybe I&#8217;m
                                        getting ahead of myself ;) I&#8217;m
                                        saying a tool that deploys should take
                                        as an argument a directory, not a single
                                        file. (If the tool then zips it up and
                                        uploads it, fine!)
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        Configuration &quot;comes from the
                                        outside&quot;. That is, an application
                                        requests services, and the
                                        <em>container</em> tells the application
                                        where those services are. For Silver
                                        Lining I&#8217;ve used environmental
                                        variables. I think this one point is
                                        really important &#8212; the container
                                        <em>tells</em> the application. As a
                                        counter-example, an application that
                                        comes with a Puppet deployment recipe is
                                        essentially <em>telling</em> the server
                                        how to arrange itself to suit the
                                        application. This will never be reliable
                                        or simple!
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        The application indicates what
                                        &quot;services&quot; it wants; for
                                        instance, it may want to have access to
                                        a MySQL database. The container then
                                        provides this to the application. In
                                        practice this means installing the
                                        actual packages, but also creating a
                                        database and setting up permissions
                                        appropriately. The alternative is never
                                        having <em>any</em> dependencies,
                                        meaning you have to use SQLite databases
                                        or ad hoc structures, etc. But in fact
                                        installing databases really isn&#8217;t
                                        that hard these days.

                                        <em>All</em> persistence has to use a
                                        service of some kind. If you want to be
                                        able to write to files, you need to use
                                        a file service. This means the container
                                        is fully aware of everything the
                                        application is leaving behind. All the
                                        various paths an application should use
                                        are given in different environmental
                                        variables (many of which don&#8217;t
                                        need to be invented anew, e.g.,
                                        <tt class="docutils literal"

                                        It uses vendor libraries exclusively for
                                        Python libraries. That means the
                                        application bundles all the libraries it
                                        requires. Nothing ever gets installed at
                                        deploy-time. This is in contrast to
                                        using a
                                        <tt class="docutils literal"
                                            ><span class="pre"

                                        list of packages at deployment time. If
                                        you want to use those tools for
                                        development that&#8217;s fine, just not
                                        for deployment.

                                        There <em>is</em> also a way to indicate
                                        other libraries you might require; e.g.,
                                        you might
                                        <tt class="docutils literal"
                                            ><span class="pre">lxml</span></tt
                                        >, or even something that isn&#8217;t
                                        quite a library, like
                                        <tt class="docutils literal"
                                            ><span class="pre">git</span></tt
                                        >
                                        (if you are making a github clone). You
                                        can&#8217;t do those as vendor libraries
                                        (they include non-portable binaries).
                                        Currently in Silver Lining the
                                        application description can contain a
                                        list of Ubuntu package names to install.
                                        Of course that would have to be
                                        abstracted some.

                                        You can ask for scripts or a request to
                                        be invoked for an application after an
                                        installation or deployment. It&#8217;s
                                        lame to try to test if
                                        is-this-app-installed on
                                        <em>every</em> request, which is the
                                        frequent alternative. Also, it gives the
                                        application the chance to signal that
                                        the installation failed.

                                        It has a very simple (possibly/probably
                                        too simple) sense of configuration. You
                                        don&#8217;t have to use this if you make
                                        your app self-configuring (i.e., build
                                        in a web-accessible settings screen),
                                        but in practice it felt like some simple
                                        sense of configuration would be helpful.

                                        package. There are very few! But maybe
                                        an alternative could be provided for
                                        these cases.

                                        A little convention-over-configuration
                                        is probably suitable for the bundled
                                        libraries; silver includes tools to
                                        manage things, but it gets a little
                                        twisty. When creating a new project I
                                        find myself creating several
                                        <tt class="docutils literal"

                                        files, special customizing modules, etc.
                                        Managing vendor libraries is also not
                                        obvious.

                                        are IMHO quite important and useful, but
                                        also need to be carefully specified.

                                        There&#8217;s a bunch of runtime
                                        expectations that aren&#8217;t part of
                                        the format, but in practice would be
                                        part of how the application is written.
                                        For instance, I make sure each app has
                                        its own temporary directory, and that it
                                        is cleared on update. If you keep
                                        session files in that location, and you
                                        expect the environment to clean up old
                                        sessions &#8212; well, either all
                                        environments should do that, or none
                                        should.
                                    </li>

                                        The process model is not entirely clear.
                                        I tried to simply define one process
                                        model (unthreaded, multiple processes),
                                        but I&#8217;m not sure that&#8217;s
                                        suitable &#8212; most notably, multiple
                                        processes have a significant memory
                                        impact compared to threads. An
                                        application should at least be able to
                                        indicate what process models it accepts
                                        and prefers.

                                    <li>
                                        Static files are <em>all</em> convention
                                        over configuration &#8212; you put
                                        static files under
                                        <tt class="docutils literal"
                                            ><span class="pre"
                                                >static/</span
                                            ></tt
                                        >
                                        and then they are available. So
                                        <tt class="docutils literal"
                                            ><span class="pre"
                                                >static/style.css</span
                                            ></tt
                                        >
                                        would be at
                                        <tt class="docutils literal"
                                            ><span class="pre"
                                                >/style.css</span
                                            ></tt
                                        >. I think this is generally
                                        <em>good</em>, but putting all static
                                        files under one URL path (e.g.,
                                        <tt class="docutils literal"
                                            ><span class="pre"
                                                >/media/</span
                                            ></tt
                                        >) can be good for other reasons as
                                        well. Maybe there should be conventions
                                        for both.

                                        Cron jobs are important. Though maybe
                                        they could just be yet another kind of
                                        service? Many extra features could be
                                        new services.

                                        Logging is also important; Silver Lining
                                        attempts to handle that somewhat, but it
                                        could be specified much better.

                                        Silver Lining also supports PHP, which
                                        seemed to cause a bit of stress. But
                                        just ignore that. It&#8217;s really easy
                                        to ignore.

                                    other stuff that is only really specified in
                                    code; but in Silver Lining&#8217;s defense,
                                    specified in code is better than unspecified
                                    ;) App Engine provides another example of an
                                    application format, and would be worth using
                                    as a point of discussion or contrast (I did
                                    that myself when writing Silver Lining).

                                    Discussing WSGI stuff with Ben Bangert at
                                    PyCon he noted that he didn&#8217;t really
                                    feel like the WSGI pieces needed that much
                                    more work, or at least that&#8217;s not
                                    where the interesting work was &#8212; the
                                    interesting work is in the tooling. An
                                    application format could provide a great
                                    basis for building this tooling. And I
                                    honestly think that the tooling has been
                                    held back more by divergent patterns of
                                    development than by the difficulty of
                                    writing the tools themselves; and a good,
                                    general application format could fix that.

                                        I think it&#8217;s a good idea. While
                                        WAR may not be a great deployment
                                        container, many other features from Java
                                        web world are pretty good regarding
                                        packaging and APIs.

                                        That&#8217;s probably the main target:
                                        make it possible to deploy a webapp to a
                                        standard container, independently of the
                                        framework/technology it uses. This would
                                        mean creating something like the Servlet
                                        API and/or other J2EE APIs.

                                                WSGI is akin to the Servlet API,
                                                only better ;) I feel like the
                                                Python world flirted with
                                                copying J2EE and other Java
                                                stuff for a while, and it all
                                                turned out badly. But&#8230;
                                                inspiration in terms of scope
                                                would be fine ;)
                                            </p>

                                            <p>
                                                Well&#8230; thinking about it:
                                                WSGI doesn&#8217;t cover
                                                <em>everything</em>, which is
                                                why this notion of multiple
                                                platforms makes sense.
                                                It&#8217;s not just that Python
                                                is a platform, but Python+WSGI
                                                would probably be the inaugural
                                                platform. Other server setups
                                                (primarily async systems that
                                                don&#8217;t use WSGI) would be
                                                new platforms &#8212; obviously
                                                sharing a large amount with
                                                Python+WSGI, but with some
                                                different details and different
                                                constraints on the containers
                                                (async being generally harder to
                                                support than sync-aka-WSGI,
                                                since one can be implemented in
                                                the other but not vice versa).

                                    <p>
                                        I&#8217;m definitely in favor of getting
                                        a better application package in Python,
                                        but I do wonder if the focus is on the
                                        wrong things. Honestly, tools like dpkg
                                        and rpm do a perfectly suitable job of
                                        handling the filesystem aspects. What
                                        seems more difficult is how do you
                                        specify how to run the actual
                                        application? How do you stop it? Does
                                        this work on Windows? What and how do
                                        you get status from an application? It
                                        seems like if these questions of how do
                                        you manage a deployed python application
                                        then you&#8217;d begin to see some
                                        really interesting things happen because
                                        the deployment question is answered.

                                        I do think the Web Site Process Bus (<a

                                        >) is one tool that leans towards the
                                        idea of a standard means of distributing
                                        and deploying Python web apps. Also, in
                                        terms of packaging with dpkg/rpm, my
                                        point is not to suggest &#8220;just use
                                        dpkg&#8221;, but rather to suggest that
                                        the goal of having a directory to deploy
                                        to maps very well to a tarball + meta
                                        data for uninstalling. If folks
                                        don&#8217;t want to use rpm or dpkg, the
                                        models they both prescribe seem correct
                                        in what they specify a package do.

                                                It would not be unreasonable to
                                                create a deb or rpm out of this
                                                format, and that could be part
                                                of a deployment process &#8212;
                                                but the format goes much further
                                                than deb or rpm. (Debian

                                                AFAIK has not in the case of web
                                                apps.) Configuration in

                                                handled at the Linux package
                                                level, but is essential to this
                                                system (e.g., configuring a

                                                from the web application, with
                                                appropriate permissions).

                                                There is a specification of how
                                                to run the application. Stopping
                                                and starting are implicitly left
                                                to the container. There&#8217;s
                                                no notification, but it would be
                                                reasonable to have such
                                                notifications &#8212; though the
                                                idea of &#8220;the app is going
                                                down&#8221; is too expansive
                                                IMHO &#8212; only &#8220;this
                                                process is coming to a
                                                halt&#8221;.

                                                Windows is irrelevant in my
                                                opinion &#8212; it has ceased to
                                                be a serious deployment target,
                                                and supporting it only for
                                                purpose of development machines
                                                I don&#8217;t believe is worth
                                                the effort. But that&#8217;s
                                                just my opinion and the
                                                specification need not be
                                                particularly opinionated in this
                                                regard. But I think it would be
                                                counterproductive to try to
                                                create an abstraction above both
                                                Windows and Linux, it would be
                                                better to simply put the burden
                                                on Windows people to translate
                                                Linux concepts. Supporting
                                                Windows isn&#8217;t worth the
                                                drag on development.

                                                It would be nice to have a
                                                declared way to ping an
                                                application for its
                                                &#8220;status&#8221; &#8212;
                                                maybe at the most minimal,
                                                noting that it is alive and
                                                responding, though it could also
                                                do other tests. The number of
                                                tests it does effects the
                                                reasonable frequency of pinging,
                                                so there&#8217;d have to be some
                                                thought, or maybe just two kinds
                                                of ping &#8212; alive and
                                                status, with two times.

                                                Silver Lining does I think show

                                                    <p>
                                                        I do agree that the
                                                        package should have more
                                                        info. I suppose my point
                                                        is that just as
                                                        setup.py/.cfg is a known
                                                        file and /etc is for
                                                        known configuration, a
                                                        package can have the
                                                        same specified paths. I
                                                        think we are agreeing
                                                        there ;)
                                                    </p>

                                                    <p>
                                                        I&#8217;m also perfectly
                                                        fine avoiding Windows. I
                                                        only bring it up because
                                                        Python as a platform
                                                        (typically) supports
                                                        Windows, therefore
                                                        I&#8217;d imagine some
                                                        support would be
                                                        desired. If you have no
                                                        desire to make this
                                                        concept blessed within
                                                        the scope of Python as a
                                                        language (again fine by
                                                        me), then no Windows
                                                        support is definitely
                                                        preferred.

                                                        The reasoning behind the
                                                        communicative aspects is
                                                        that deployments range
                                                        from pushing an app to a
                                                        machine to configuring a
                                                        deployment amongst
                                                        hundreds (thousands?) of
                                                        machines. The result
                                                        being that often times
                                                        you need more
                                                        information other than
                                                        just &#8220;are you up
                                                        or not&#8221;. Likewise,
                                                        if an application does
                                                        fail, what do you do?
                                                        You probably look to the
                                                        logs, check things like
                                                        disk I/O, network I/O,
                                                        data stores. A load
                                                        balancer might be able
                                                        to switch traffic to
                                                        other nodes. It would be
                                                        nice to have a means of
                                                        communicating with the
                                                        environment to see if it
                                                        can help you debug the
                                                        problem where it
                                                        happened. For example,
                                                        running the application
                                                        tests.

                                                        I&#8217;m not trying to
                                                        say you should support
                                                        all these details, but
                                                        rather suggesting that
                                                        without a known way of
                                                        communicating to the
                                                        deployed environment,
                                                        these are all ad-hoc
                                                        solutions. A simple API
                                                        could make a lot of this
                                                        less painful. Imagine if
                                                        there was an assumption
                                                        that when an app crashes
                                                        on a server you should
                                                        easily be able to tell
                                                        the env to run a suite
                                                        diagnostics and tests to
                                                        see what external issues
                                                        could be the problem.
                                                        The word
                                                        &#8220;assumption&#8221;
                                                        is important here. In
                                                        support channels there
                                                        are assumptions such as
                                                        &#8220;send me a stace
                                                        trace&#8221; or
                                                        &#8220;can you send me a
                                                        screen shot&#8221;.
                                                        These kind of
                                                        assumptions for web
                                                        applications have
                                                        typically been limited,
                                                        but there is no reason
                                                        they have to be if you
                                                        can convene on a system
                                                        of communication.

                                        I don&#8217;t know, seems like a
                                        potential step backwards to me.
                                        I&#8217;m more a fan of
                                        &#8220;rsync&#8221; or file copy
                                        deployments. That&#8217;s one thing PHP
                                        has right and it&#8217;s one of the
                                        reasons PHP has been so successful.
                                        I&#8217;m not ruling it out, but
                                        I&#8217;d prefer the rsync deployment
                                        problem was solved first.

                                        I really like the idea of defining an
                                        interface between packages and
                                        containers.

                                    <p>
                                        I&#8217;m trying to go a similar
                                        direction with Silk (<a
                                            href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/silk-deployment"

                                        >), though it has some distance to go,
                                        having started more with Fabric scripts
                                        and inspiration from Google App Engine
                                        (and some of your early Silver Lining
                                        posts).
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        I&#8217;ll take a look at Silver
                                        Lining&#8217;s package format and think
                                        about what it would take to deploy a
                                        Silver-Lining-configured application on
                                        Silk&#8217;s Nginx/Gunicorn/Supervisord
                                        stack. Maybe it&#8217;s not at the level
                                        you want, but Supervisord&#8217;s XML
                                        RPC interface has been nice for getting
                                        process state.

                                                Cool! While I have been
                                                opinionated about things in some
                                                places in Silver Lining,
                                                I&#8217;ve tried fairly hard to
                                                keep other parts separated
                                                &#8212; so for instance, an
                                                application should not know or
                                                care if it is running under
                                                mod&#95;wsgi or gunicorn, etc.
                                                It would be a nice test of this
                                                if Silk used the same format
                                                (which itself is simple enough
                                                that it&#8217;s not a big deal
                                                if you even use any of Silver
                                                Lining&#8217;s code;
                                                reimplementing shouldn&#8217;t
                                                be a barrier). [This app](<a

                                                >) is a very simple example, but
                                                could be a start for a test. It
                                                would be cool to have an app
                                                that tested its container
                                                (probably through a combination
                                                of self-testing once it is
                                                uploaded, and then running some
                                                tool that makes a bunch of
                                                requests and then tests the side

                                                It might be nice if the
                                                development and deployment tools
                                                were separated. E.g.,
                                                <code>silver serve</code> (which
                                                serves up an app locally for

                                                        Good point about
                                                        separating deployment
                                                        from devserver. If the
                                                        package is standardized
                                                        then the devserver is
                                                        just another thing that
                                                        can be outside the
                                                        project&#8217;s scope
                                                        (so long as it complies
                                                        with the package spec).
                                                        Then we can even have
                                                        competing
                                                        implementations of the
                                                        devserver&#8230; maybe
                                                        even a pretty GUI one
                                                        like App Engine has on
                                                        Windows and Mac. That
                                                        would make the designers
                                                        I work with a lot

                                        I find it completely unpythonic. You
                                        want to build an abstract FRAMEWORK. And
                                        the reason why I think Python is a
                                        wonderful tool is that it conforms to
                                        the philosophy of Unix &#8211; it can be
                                        easily scripted and integrated with
                                        other OS tools, unlike Java which builds
                                        it&#8217;s own world.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        I have worked for years with Java
                                        webapps and in practice WARs and EARs
                                        are inconvenient. You have to deal with
                                        large files even for simple changes.
                                        They work on a single app server unless
                                        a special attention and testing is
                                        given. Working with unpacked archives
                                        &#8211; convenient for development work
                                        &#8211; doesn&#8217;t work well and
                                        isn&#8217;t standarized.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        I also don&#8217;t see a real need for
                                        such archives &#8211; 99% of web
                                        applications are developed in-house and
                                        don&#8217;t need abstract deployment
                                        protocol. And for such cases home-grown
                                        scripts for deployment are the best
                                        &#8211; you have the full control and
                                        don&#8217;t rely on some abstract
                                        mechanism, which unix admins can&#8217;t
                                        deal with.

                                        Hm, regular python packaging is a solved
                                        problem now, so we move on to web
                                        packaging? Talk about getting ahead of

                                        Who would have thought that something as
                                        simple as
                                        <em>manipulating a list</em> (sys.path)
                                        could be so difficult.

                                        I haven&#8217;t tried silverlining since
                                        around the time it changed its name from
                                        toppcloud, but the thing that turned me
                                        off about it was that I found the end
                                        result of deploying rather opaque. I
                                        understood my local development rig, but
                                        the deployment result on the server was
                                        rather different and I had a hard time
                                        finding things and understanding how it
                                        was tied together, so when things went
                                        wrong it was difficult to figure out.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        I&#8217;m suggesting that having a smart
                                        container that eases deployment is
                                        great, but the implementation needs to
                                        be documented, and be as simple as
                                        possible to inspect and troubleshoot
                                        without special tools. And I think
                                        there&#8217;s value in having the
                                        production system be similar to the
                                        development system &#8211; or to flip
                                        that around, every difference between
                                        them is a potential source of
                                        hard-to-fix trouble.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        I wish I could remember the details. I
                                        wonder how much of the stuff that
                                        confused me fell under the header of
                                        &#8220;stuff that is only really
                                        specified in code&#8221;. It felt rather
                                        like an &#8220;80% solution&#8221; to
                                        me, but it&#8217;s unfair to say that
                                        about something whose docs prominently
                                        say &#8220;don&#8217;t use this
                                        yet&#8221; :)

                                        Meanwhile, most deployments are simple
                                        enough that I&#8217;m quite happy with
                                        the old workflow of pip install -r
                                        requirements.txt &amp;&amp;
                                        edit-some-config-files.

                                    <p>I like Chef.</p>

                                    <p>
                                        Personally I think web applications
                                        involve too many layers and moving parts
                                        to be packaged like typical software
                                        packages. Over-coming this problem is
                                        going to inherit the complexities of
                                        those moving parts, their configuration,
                                        and so on. It seems like barking up the
                                        wrong tree&#8230; but maybe I&#8217;m
                                        just lazy.
                                    </p>

                                        One could use Fabric I guess if staying
                                        pure-Python really matters to you. Chef
                                        is better though in a lot of ways.
                                        Fabric could be better if there were
                                        more contributors. :)

                                        I&#8217;d be interested in knowing if
                                        someone can actually bypass the
                                        complexities I&#8217;ve noted and
                                        actually create a package solution for
                                        installing web applications.
                                    </p>

                                        Sorry, didn&#8217;t mean to be a downer.
                                        I will definitely be keeping an eye on
                                        silverlining. Mostly just wanted to pass
                                        along the thoughts about troubleshooting
                                        deployment results.
