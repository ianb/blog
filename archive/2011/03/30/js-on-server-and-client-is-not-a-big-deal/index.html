                                    straight-forward to get started so
                                    it&#8217;s an
                                    <em>emotionally satisfying</em> experience.

                                    There are several reasons you might want to
                                    use Node.js, and I&#8217;ll ignore many of
                                    them, but I want to talk about one in
                                    particular:
                                </p>

                                    Is this such a great feature? I think

                                        Sure. Yay ignorance! But really, this is
                                        <em>fine</em> but unlikely to be
                                        relevant to any current potential
                                        audience for Node.js. If you are
                                        shooting for an very-easy-to-learn
                                        client-server programming system,
                                        Node.js isn&#8217;t it. Maybe

                                        or something similar has that potential?
                                        But I digress.

                                        It&#8217;s not easy to have expertise at
                                        multiple languages. But it&#8217;s not
                                        <em>that hard</em>. It&#8217;s
                                        considerably harder to have expertise at
                                        <em>multiple platforms</em>. Node.js
                                        gives you one language across client and
                                        server, but <em>not</em> one platform.
                                        Node.js programming doesn&#8217;t
                                        <em>feel</em> like the browser
                                        environment. They do adopt many
                                        conventions when it&#8217;s reasonable,
                                        but even then it&#8217;s not always the
                                        case &#8212; in particular because many
                                        browser APIs are the awkward product of
                                        C++ programmers exposing things to
                                        Javascript, and you don&#8217;t want to
                                        reproduce those same APIs if you
                                        don&#8217;t have to (and Node.js
                                        doesn&#8217;t have to!) &#8212; an
                                        example is the event pattern in Node,
                                        which is similar to a browser but less
                                        obtuse.

                                        First: the same set of libraries is
                                        probably not applicable. If you can do
                                        it on the client then you probably
                                        don&#8217;t <em>have</em> to do it on
                                        the server, and vice versa.

                                    <p>
                                        But sometimes the same libraries are
                                        useful. Can you really share them?
                                        Browser libraries are often hard to use
                                        elsewhere because they rely on browser
                                        APIs. These APIs are frequently

                                        Actually they are possible to implement
                                        in Javascript using

                                        V8 is a pretty conservative

                                        Besides these unimplementable APIs, it
                                        is also just a different environment.
                                        There is the trivial: the
                                        <tt class="docutils literal"
                                            ><span class="pre">window</span></tt
                                        >
                                        object in the browser has a Node.js
                                        equivalent, but it&#8217;s not named
                                        <tt class="docutils literal"
                                            ><span class="pre">window</span></tt
                                        >. Performance is different &#8212; Node
                                        has long-running processes, the browser
                                        <em>might</em>. Node can have blocking
                                        calls, which are useful even if you
                                        can&#8217;t use them at runtime (e.g.,
                                        <tt class="docutils literal"
                                            ><span class="pre"
                                                >require()</span
                                            ></tt
                                        >); but you can&#8217;t really have any
                                        of these at any time on the browser. And
                                        then of course all the system calls,
                                        <em>none</em> of which you can use in
                                        the browser.

                                        All these may simply be surmountable
                                        challenges, through modularity, mocking,
                                        abstractions, and so on&#8230; but
                                        ultimately I think the motivation is
                                        lacking: the domain of changing a
                                        live-rendered DOM isn&#8217;t the same
                                        as producing bytes to put onto a socket.

                                        <em>useful</em>. The client and the

                                        different expectations. Any vagueness
                                        about that boundary is <em>wrong</em>.

                                        platforms. The client trusts itself, and
                                        the server trusts itself, and both
                                        should hold the other in suspicion
                                        (though the client can be more trusting
                                        because the
                                        <em>browser</em> doesn&#8217;t trust the
                                        client code).
                                    </p>

                                        But it&#8217;s also the wrong way to
                                        treat HTTP. HTTP is pretty simple until
                                        you try to make it simpler. Efforts to
                                        make it simpler mostly make it more
                                        complicated. HTTP lets you send
                                        serialized data back and forth to a
                                        server, with a bunch of metadata and
                                        other do-dads. And that&#8217;s all
                                        neat, but you should always be thinking
                                        about <em>sending</em> information. And
                                        never <em>sharing</em> information.
                                        It&#8217;s not a fluid boundary, and
                                        code that touches HTTP needs to be
                                        explicit about it and not pretend it is
                                        equivalent to any other non-network
                                        operation.

                                    <p>
                                        Certainly you don&#8217;t
                                        <em>need</em> two implementation
                                        languages to keep your mind clear. But
                                        it doesn&#8217;t hurt.

                                        One of the things people frequently
                                        bring up is that you can validate data
                                        on the client and server using the same
                                        code. And of course, what web developer
                                        hasn&#8217;t been a little frustrated
                                        that they have to implement validation
                                        twice?
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Validation on the client is primarily a
                                        <em>user experience</em> concern, where
                                        you focus on bringing attention to
                                        problems with a form, and helping the
                                        user resolve those problems. You may be
                                        able to avoid errors entirely with an
                                        input method that avoids the problem
                                        (e.g., if a you have a slider for a
                                        numeric input, you don&#8217;t have to
                                        worry about the user inputing a
                                        non-numeric value).
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Once the form is submitted, if
                                        you&#8217;ve done thorough client-side
                                        validation you can also avoid
                                        <em>friendly</em> server-side
                                        validation. Of course all your
                                        client-side validation could be avoided
                                        through a malicious client, but you
                                        don&#8217;t need to give a friendly
                                        error message in that case, you can
                                        simply bail out with a simple 400 Bad
                                        Request error.

                                        common between these two kinds of
                                        validation &#8212; the client is all
                                        user experience, and the server is all
                                        data integrity.

                                        is becoming increasingly less relevant,
                                        and if we aren&#8217;t
                                        <em>there</em> yet, then we&#8217;ll
                                        certainly <em>get there</em> soon.
                                        It&#8217;s only a matter of time, the
                                        writing is on the wall. Depending on the
                                        project you might have to put in
                                        workarounds, but we should keep those
                                        concerns out of architecture decisions.
                                        Maintaining crazy hacks is
                                        <em>not</em> worth it. There&#8217;s so
                                        many terrible hacks that have turned
                                        into frameworks, and frameworks that
                                        have justified themselves because of the
                                        problems they solved that no longer

                                        I&#8217;m not saying Node.js is
                                        <em>bad</em>. There are other arguments
                                        for it, and you don&#8217;t need to make
                                        <em>any</em> argument for it if you just
                                        feel like using it. It&#8217;s fun to do
                                        something new. And I&#8217;m as
                                        optimistic about Javascript as anyone.
                                        But this one argument, I do not think it
                                        is very good.

                                        y&#8217;know, I always thought it would
                                        be a good idea to share JS code both
                                        client and server in theory but I never
                                        tried to do it and never really thought
                                        it through. I must admit you have some
                                        good points here.

                                        Java. Otherwise, if you didn&#8217;t
                                        have to why would you <em>choose</em> to
                                        use Javascript&#8230; (It&#8217;s not a
                                        bad language at its core, just too many
                                        insanities along with it.)

                                        studio or what? Javascript is a
                                        fantastic language, having nothing to do
                                        with Java.

                                        @Joe whoa there! Michael is just saying
                                        that JavaScript (which he well knows is
                                        not Java) isn&#8217;t as attractive to
                                        someone already using a language like,
                                        say, Ruby or Python. I am pretty sure
                                        the Django programmers I know
                                        aren&#8217;t about to start using
                                        JavaScript for their server-side work
                                        any time soon, but many of them know
                                        enough about JavaScript to be able to
                                        maintain asset catalogs and deliver just
                                        the necessary JS code to the client with
                                        each page, say. Same goes for the Rails
                                        people, I would guess.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        JavaScript is an OK language with
                                        sensible developers behind it who are
                                        trying to make it better. And of course
                                        the connection with Java is simply that
                                        Java was so hot in 1993/4 that Netscape
                                        couldn&#8217;t resist trying to tar
                                        their new language with the same brush
                                        despite obvious dissimilarities.

                                        &#8220;the client is all user
                                        experience, and the server is all data
                                        integrity.&#8221; I don&#8217;t think
                                        about it this way. In both cases, you
                                        need to validate the data the same way,
                                        you just respond to invalid data
                                        differently. Sliders or not, at the end
                                        of the day a lot (probably most) of the
                                        data from the end user ends up typed
                                        into text fields and it needs the same
                                        validation in both places. True this is
                                        not an enormous benefit, but it&#8217;s
                                        still a good benefit.

                                        Honestly, node.js does have a lot of
                                        buzz, but I don&#8217;t think anyone in
                                        the community is arguing that the
                                        sharing across client/server is a
                                        primary cause of the hype. I think folks
                                        are excited by the async mindset, high
                                        concurrency, general cleverness that is
                                        happening around node, with sharing code
                                        as a nifty bonus.

                                        You know, I&#8217;ve had a sneaking
                                        suspicion that this was the case.
                                        I&#8217;ve been anxious that it was not,
                                        that JS on the client and JS on the
                                        server was going to be a killer
                                        advantage of Node and make Twisted
                                        gradually irrelevant, because Javascript
                                        is so damn popular, because deployment
                                        is king, and it&#8217;s deployed
                                        everywhere. Your post has settled my
                                        nerves a bit :).
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        You see, one of the big advantages of
                                        Twisted is that you can use Python on
                                        the client and Python on the server.
                                        I&#8217;ve worked on thick client,
                                        client-server applications with Twisted,
                                        and boy, do I miss it. It&#8217;s a
                                        really pleasant experience. It
                                        dramatically decreases the amount of
                                        testing you have to do. It decreases the
                                        amount of data modeling you have to do
                                        and the proliferation of a million
                                        different almost-but-not-quite-the-same
                                        data structures. It doesn&#8217;t have
                                        most of the issues that you&#8217;re
                                        talking about, because you really can
                                        use the same libraries in both places,
                                        and you can trivially write new
                                        libraries that work in both (because
                                        it&#8217;s the same Python VM
                                        everywhere). I sincerely hope that one
                                        day I can replicate that experience with
                                        a web browser, by treating the browser
                                        as a dumb deployment target and just
                                        sending it a bunch of Python code, in
                                        the form of x86 code for NaCl, or
                                        javascript emitted from PyPy&#8217;s
                                        not-really-currently-working JS backend,
                                        or something like that. Because the
                                        browser is what you get to work with in
                                        this sad, modern world.

                                        I thought that Node might have beaten us
                                        to the punch, and that I&#8217;d be
                                        fated one day to work on applications in
                                        some half-assed server-side JavaScript
                                        IDE instead of a nice Twisted
                                        environment with all of its attendant
                                        features and bells and whistles. This is
                                        a very straightforward progression of
                                        the worse-is-better phenomenon and it
                                        was starting to bum me out a little bit.

                                        But the ray of hope you&#8217;ve given
                                        me is this: JavaScript is really, really
                                        terrible. Like, literally unusably bad;
                                        i.e. there are many problems for which
                                        you simply cannot use it. In the
                                        original worse-is-better scenario, C had
                                        all kinds of flaws compared to lisp; its
                                        compilers, debuggers, and profilers
                                        weren&#8217;t as good; there were barely
                                        any GUIs by the time all Lisp
                                        development was being done on bitmapped
                                        displays, and so on. But C (and UNIX)
                                        had one killer feature: it got libraries
                                        right. You could just smash some C files
                                        into a directory, and then re-use them.

                                        together, freely intercalling functions,
                                        and using the same basic data
                                        representations. You don’t have a
                                        foreign loader, you don’t coerce types
                                        across function-call boundaries, you
                                        don’t make one language dominant, and

                                        However, if there&#8217;s one key design
                                        criterion for browsers, it is making the
                                        woes of your implementation technology

                                        possible. We&#8217;re getting close to
                                        20 years into JavaScript, and still it
                                        has no standard - or even widely
                                        recognized &#8211; notion of a
                                        &#8220;library&#8221; &#8211; or even a

                                        and by the way I hope you&#8217;re using
                                        HTML&#8221;. As you&#8217;re outlining
                                        the practical issues with re-using
                                        libraries from the browser, like for
                                        example the fact that you can&#8217;t
                                        actually implement many standard
                                        JavaScript features in standard
                                        JavaScript (still!), I realize that
                                        these concerns are not snobbish
                                        aesthetic affectations that I have in my
                                        insulated Python mindset, but real
                                        issues that affect people trying to use
                                        these technologies every day.

                                        I&#8217;m sure that this situation can
                                        get better (and I hope it does, because
                                        I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;ll have to write
                                        browser javascript again at some point
                                        in my career), but the fact that it is
                                        still this bad after this long is an
                                        indication that there&#8217;s still a
                                        strong livelihood to be had for Python
                                        on the internet. Anywhere where the
                                        problem is hard enough to actually need
                                        a re-usable library that does something
                                        more logically challenging than an
                                        expando-tab GUI pseudo-widget.

                                        And also, as you point out, it&#8217;s
                                        not <em>that</em> bad to have to
                                        duplicate a little logic for the client.
                                        This is also heartening because I would
                                        definitely like to be able to leverage
                                        the browser platform (at the very least,
                                        for the Twisted web site!) and not have
                                        maintaining that logic be a total
                                        nightmare.

                                        I think the big win for Node.js is that
                                        it&#8217;s the first non-blocking server
                                        to get widespread interest. Obviously
                                        Twisted and Tornado have similar
                                        advantages, and you can do clever stuff
                                        with gevent and gunicorn and similar
                                        greenlet-based stuff and not even have
                                        to know that it&#8217;s non-blocking,
                                        but none of them have had the levels of
                                        popular interest that they deserve.
                                        Perhaps Django&#8217;s (well-deserved)
                                        dominance of the Python web space holds
                                        them back?

                                        Node.js, on the other hand, perhaps
                                        because it&#8217;s interesting to all of
                                        the JS people who aren&#8217;t willing
                                        to learn other languages, and is the
                                        only popular JS server, is exposing
                                        non-blocking server IO to many more
                                        people. On the other hand, given the
                                        &#8220;not willing to learn other
                                        languages&#8221; thing, perhaps
                                        that&#8217;s not a plus.

                                                adverse to learning other

                                                (which works the same way). I
                                                think there&#8217;s actually a

                                                community to make Javascript
                                                programming more reasonable, and
                                                it shows the maturity of work
                                                done by people familiar with

                                        Forget about it. Yeah they have js, but
                                        only just, using node.js to serve up
                                        static resources is an awesome option
                                        for those cases, and the more devices
                                        that get online, the more feature rich
                                        websites get, the more compelling this

                                        ECMA proxies are definitely not an

                                        In fact Node was designed to be
                                        extensible in just this way. isaacs has
                                        created Node extension that implements
                                        most of the Harmony proxies API:

                                        You conveniently miss the reality that
                                        there are already <em>hundreds</em> of
                                        high quality and useful libraries that
                                        work on both the client and the server.
                                        To name a few: jQuery, YUI,
                                        Underscore.js, Require.js,
                                        Processing.js&#8230;.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        The argument that browser APIs are
                                        different is irrelevant. The vast
                                        majority of browser API landscape is
                                        available on the server-side e.g. JSDom
                                        (full Dom on the server), node-canvas
                                        (full canvas tag API on the server).
                                    </p>

                                        If you require a language barrier to
                                        make you think about implementing
                                        security constraints between the client
                                        and the server then you have far greater
                                        things to worry about when it comes to
                                        security: i.e. <em>incompetence</em>.

                                        Yes validation on the client is a user
                                        experience concern. Its great to be able
                                        to fully inform the user of any issues
                                        before having to wait for requests to
                                        the server-side. This allows real-time
                                        validation for free. I really
                                        don&#8217;t get your point here. What
                                        the problem?

                                        Two things immediately come to mind: 1.
                                        SEO e.g. Google indexing an RAI 2. blind
                                        people (no ARIA etc is not always
                                        adequate).
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        I don&#8217;t think anyones trying to
                                        dismiss Ruby, Python, Scala, Erlang,
                                        Haskell, LOLcode&#8230; whatever&#8230;
                                        as irrelevant on the server because of
                                        JavaScript. All the best to those
                                        communities, if it works for you &#8211;
                                        great =D.

                                        Many people however do find full stack
                                        JavaScript to be an awesome environment
                                        to work in. Including many new
                                        developers who come from other walks of
                                        life and don&#8217;t want the overhead
                                        of learning multiple languages straight
                                        away. Spreading FUD, or simply misguided
                                        non-factual unfounded opinion, helps
                                        nobody.

                                                Well, I won&#8217;t reply
                                                because I&#8217;ve made my
                                                statement and people can judge
                                                on their own. But your snide
                                                conclusion is unnecessary, and
                                                is no small part of why I will
                                                refrain from further engaging
                                                with your arguments.

                                                While @JSNinjaTrainer is
                                                technically correct that
                                                Ian&#8217;s post is not at all
                                                accurate the negativity is
                                                unnecessary. The comment
                                                unfortunately is a disservice to
                                                an otherwise sound argument and
                                                those who would stand beside it.

                                                JSNinjaTrainer, some of your
                                                counterpoints are valid, but
                                                some are kind of contradictory.
                                                Here are two points you made:
                                            </p>

                                                Language: &#8220;Like it or not
                                                this is less cognitive
                                                load&#8230;.&#8221; Re: You can
                                                work fluidly across client and

                                                So it&#8217;s okay and desirable
                                                in the first case to seek less
                                                cognitive load, but the desire
                                                for less cognitive load in the
                                                second case is a mark of
                                                incompetence? Couldn&#8217;t you
                                                just as easily say that a
                                                client/server language barrier
                                                is less cognitive load? Or (if
                                                you want to be negative) that
                                                only knowing one language is a
                                                mark of incompetence?

                                                        I think &#8220;You Only

                                                        Language&#8221; would be
                                                        better labelled
                                                        &#8220;You Only Need To

                                                        In One Language&#8221;,
                                                        excluding HTML &amp; CSS
                                                        which are domain
                                                        specific of course. This
                                                        is less cognitive load
                                                        as I find it easier to
                                                        focus on solutions

                                                        for security was not

                                                        If your using a language
                                                        barrier to implement
                                                        security your possibly
                                                        thinking (in the context
                                                        of security) about two
                                                        things: the security AND
                                                        the different language.
                                                        Whereas with a single
                                                        language stack you only
                                                        need to focus on one
                                                        thing: security.

                                                        Simply ignoring security
                                                        because there is no
                                                        language barrier, or

                                                        Yes it would at least
                                                        big a strong warning
                                                        sign. Personally I know
                                                        enough C, PHP, Ruby,
                                                        Java and JS to not be
                                                        limited by the language
                                                        when writing any program
                                                        in any of those, as well
                                                        as a whole range of
                                                        DSLs. Yet I still prefer
                                                        a single language stack
                                                        and knowing those other
                                                        languages most
                                                        definitely improves my
                                                        JS code.

                                                        It may not always be
                                                        possible for a beginner
                                                        to learn so many
                                                        languages, which I
                                                        believe is one case that
                                                        can benefit greatly from
                                                        single language stacks
                                                        e.g. teaching web
                                                        programming courses that
                                                        include both the client
                                                        and server-sides.

                                        For some reason my comment earlier
                                        disappeared so re-posting&#8230;

                                        While @JSNinjaTrainer is technically
                                        correct that Ian&#8217;s post is far
                                        from accurate the negative tone is
                                        unnecessary. The comment is
                                        unfortunately a disservice to an
                                        otherwise sound argument and those who
                                        would stand beside it.

                                        It&#8217;s almost off-topic. Nobody
                                        talks about other scripting language in
                                        the browser that&#8217;s a big question
                                        imo. Most people learned javascript but
                                        still &#8211; who won&#8217;t agree
                                        &#8211; it&#8217;s an hard language to
                                        start with, and further doing complex
                                        thing is still hard. Just like PHP for
                                        the server side, it&#8217;s good at some
                                        point then people have to move on to
                                        increase their
                                        possibilities/productivity/maintenability.
                                        I&#8217;m not monoglot, so don&#8217;t.
                                        Is is that hard to get python in the
                                        browser for real ?

                                                It&#8217;s another extended
                                                discussion, but I don&#8217;t
                                                expect to ever see Python on the
                                                browser, nor do I think it would
                                                be a useful idea to pursue.
                                                Maybe someday there will be a
                                                place for another language in
                                                the browser besides Javascript,
                                                but I expect it to be a language
                                                designed for that purpose rather
                                                than a language ported into the
                                                browser. CoffeeScript at least
                                                hints at what that might look
                                                like, though it&#8217;s hard to
                                                really see CoffeeScript as more
                                                than a light syntax remodeling
                                                for Javascript. But maybe
                                                it&#8217;s a step on the way to
                                                a viable spectrum of
                                                browser-based languages.

                                                I think .NET and the CLR is a
                                                good piece of evidence for this
                                                generally: it supports multiple
                                                languages, and great effort has
                                                been put into this, but
                                                ultimately all the successful
                                                languages have been new
                                                languages designed to fit the
                                                environment; ported languages
                                                (e.g., IronPython) haven&#8217;t
                                                been very successful and I
                                                don&#8217;t have any faith in
                                                their long-term viability.

                                        Indeed, Node and browser-land are
                                        different platforms, and this, to me, is
                                        the only real concrete argument for why
                                        javascript everywhere isnt a huge win v.
                                        the existing joint different language
                                        and different platform combo existing
                                        setups present. However there are
                                        numerous shims/polyfills out there to
                                        bridge these differences. env-js,
                                        crosscheck, and jsdom are three various
                                        efforts to get the DOM usable as ssjs.
                                        browser-shim, gemini exist to bring the
                                        node platform into browser space. JS is
                                        a flexible enough language that these or
                                        most any inherent platform differences
                                        can be paved over. No, it&#8217;s not
                                        easy to cleanly harness these different
                                        pieces, to cobble together a well
                                        working Frankenstein dual-platform, but
                                        SSJS is still at its inception&#8230;
                                        well, LiveWire, circa `96, aside.
                                        What&#8217;s hard now will only get
                                        easier and more natural. The tooling is
                                        being birthed as we speak here.

                                        I&#8217;d really like elaboration on
                                        what you&#8217;re attempting to refute
                                        in &#8220;You can work fluidly across
                                        client and server!&#8221;. Can you name
                                        some existing projects which purport to
                                        do this, or cite any cases where you
                                        feel the distribution boundaries between
                                        client and server have been made too
                                        thin? I&#8217;m trying to wrap my head
                                        around what is being refuted here;
                                        it&#8217;s not clear what arguments and
                                        examples you are writing in reply to.

                                        What about other non-JS server stacks,
                                        which of them go too far in mixing
                                        server and client state into one
                                        undecypherable intractable ball (in
                                        violation of the primary directive of
                                        distributed computing)? Was ASP.NET a
                                        bridge too far? Rails&#8217; JS
                                        integration? And does the mere presence
                                        of JS on both sides imply this muddling
                                        has already happen, that work is being
                                        done too fluidly, code or state shared
                                        in some insecure or ill conceived
                                        manner?

                                        I&#8217;d throw the following into the

                                        everywhere: extensions/polyfills like
                                        underscore or kaffeine, solved native
                                        ser/deser (JavaScript Object Notation),
                                        being able to leverage the same
                                        documentation frameworks (JSDoc,
                                        Doxygen), code style policies, and code
                                        quality checks (JSLint). javascript
                                        everywhere can be a huge advantage.

                                        From a writing perspective, the
                                        conclusion could be a lot more
                                        effective, IMO. &#8220;But this one
                                        argument, I do not think it is very
                                        good,&#8221; is a weakly linked to the
                                        topic, mentioned only at the top
                                        (&#8220;Javascript on the client and the
                                        server!&#8221;) and doesnt really draw
                                        together what the goal of client and the
                                        server both would be and how your
                                        arguments against work out.

                                        Mostly, I think this is a result of
                                        insufficient exploration of the problem
                                        space; what &#8220;Javascript on the
                                        client and server&#8221; is purported to
                                        provide isnt linked or discussed
                                        anywhere. Instead the conclusion is left
                                        to refute a wide focus of things never
                                        defined in the first place. Over half
                                        the time I&#8217;m under the impression
                                        this article is an argument against

                                        templating/ajax, but the conclusion
                                        wanders back to node as webapp
                                        framework, which in many cases is
                                        altogether very different.

                                        I&#8217;m disappointed in what I
                                        perceive as your over-reaction to
                                        JSNinjaTrainer, Ian. In spite of his
                                        flippant uncalled for ending, the
                                        majority of his post was a well reckoned
                                        technical rebuttal, one I agree with in
                                        quite a few places, and think deserves
                                        more discussion. Cutting it short on
                                        account of injury is a disservice to the
                                        discussion you welcomed in by creating
                                        this post. I&#8217;d encourage you to
                                        move past the injurious LOLCode, which
                                        has been apologized for.

                                                Things like server-side DOM are
                                                largely for this purpose, except
                                                insofar as they are intended to
                                                support testing (though testing
                                                seems like the majority of uses
                                                in what I&#8217;ve seen).
                                                Well&#8230; there are entirely
                                                distinct ways to use the DOM as
                                                well (e.g., spidering) which
                                                don&#8217;t rely on
                                                client-server integration.
                                                Ironically Javascript has
                                                generally had really terrible
                                                HTML handling (no freakin&#8217;
                                                parser!) so at this point
                                                it&#8217;s still playing
                                                catch-up. (But unlike in other
                                                languages communities I think
                                                the audience will be more
                                                inclined to make full use of
                                                what it has once it does catch

                                                refuting a vaguely stated

                                                people I personally know who
                                                become excited about Node. This
                                                excitement is vague because
                                                it&#8217;s usually not about
                                                what they are concretely making,
                                                but about their excitement about
                                                <em>what they could make</em>
                                                with Node. So it&#8217;s not
                                                like people are making studious
                                                arguments about the benefits of
                                                Node, nor am I claiming all
                                                their enthusiasm is misguided
                                                (and it&#8217;s fine to be

                                                at least on this count I am
                                                skeptical.

                                                Yes, and I abhor this cleverness
                                                in other languages even more
                                                than in Javascript ;)

                                                IMHO good sharing across systems
                                                is done with documents (JSON
                                                being a perfectly good document
                                                syntax). Frequently the
                                                documents are shared over
                                                HTTP&#8230; but even in
                                                Javascript the IPC I&#8217;ve
                                                seen has been mostly text-based
                                                (typically with JSON layered on
                                                top, much like HTTP). Once you
                                                are doing this level of
                                                abstraction it&#8217;s pretty
                                                much as easy to communicate with
                                                other languages as with
                                                Javascript, all the dynamic
                                                languages handle JSON well.

                                                I found his entire post snide,
                                                and his argument style is one
                                                that I find if I engage with
                                                only leaves me pointlessly

                                                Like many parts of the

                                                Javascript community is still to
                                                be defined. Now is a time when
                                                it would be good to be conscious

                                        Every application has a common set of
                                        code needed to be run on the server and
                                        the client. All apps I wrote needed
                                        this, I can hardly imagine other apps
                                        don&#8217;t. Therefore, there&#8217;s
                                        always a shared library between client
                                        and server. At least for the data
                                        definitions.

                                        Your article does have a point, but I
                                        would have to disagree with the
                                        conclusion.

                                        I&#8217;m a hardcore C++ desktop apps
                                        programmer and have been for the last 15
                                        years &#8211; web development is not my
                                        primary occupation, but I&#8217;ve done
                                        it a lot and I like it. And from
                                        everything I&#8217;ve tried so far on
                                        the server-side (Visual Basic .exe
                                        CGI&#8217;s in the 90&#8242;s, ASP, JSP,
                                        Perl, PHP, FastCGI modules), nodejs
                                        experience is very refreshing and
                                        productive.

                                        In the case of nodejs, it is not
                                        necessarily the Javascript everywhere
                                        that is the attractor for me. It is the
                                        speed of that thing, code re-use between
                                        the browser/server and no
                                        context-switching between languages. The
                                        async API of nodejs makes it a bit
                                        unpleasant &#8212; all those callbacks
                                        and callbacks within callbacks are at
                                        some point quite horrible.

                                        But I spent 2 days and learned
                                        CoffeeScript and node.js experience (as
                                        well as browser js experience) has
                                        improved dramatically. With CoffeeScript
                                        you get the clean syntax of Python/Ruby,
                                        the flexibility of Javascript and the
                                        speed of nodejs.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        So instead of Javascript everywhere, I
                                        would vote for CoffeeScript everywhere
                                        :).
