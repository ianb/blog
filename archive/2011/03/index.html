                                            At PyCon there was an open space
                                            about deployment, and the idea of
                                            drop-in applications
                                            (Java-WAR-style).
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            I generally get pessimistic about
                                            80% solutions, and dropping in a WAR
                                            file feels like an 80% solution to
                                            me. I&#8217;ve used the
                                            Hudson/Jenkins installer (which I
                                            think is <em>specifically</em> a
                                            project that got WARs on
                                            people&#8217;s minds), and in a lot
                                            of ways that installer is nice, but
                                            it&#8217;s also kind of wonky, it
                                            makes configuration unclear,
                                            it&#8217;s not always clear when it
                                            installs or configures itself
                                            through the web, and when you have
                                            to do this at the system level, nor
                                            is it clear where it puts files and
                                            data, etc. So a great initial
                                            experience doesn&#8217;t feel like a
                                            great ongoing experience to me
                                            &#8212; and
                                            <em
                                                >it doesn&#8217;t have to be
                                                that way</em
                                            >. If those were
                                            <em>necessary</em> compromises,
                                            sure, but they aren&#8217;t. And
                                            because we
                                            <em>don&#8217;t have</em> WAR files,
                                            if we&#8217;re proposing to make
                                            something new, then we have every
                                            opportunity to make things better.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            So the question then is what
                                            we&#8217;re trying to make. To me:
                                            we want applications that are easy
                                            to install, that are
                                            self-describing, self-configuring
                                            (or at least guide you through
                                            configuration), reliable with
                                            respect to their environment (not
                                            dependent on system tweaking),
                                            upgradable, and respectful of
                                            persistence (the data that outlives
                                            the application install). A lot of
                                            this can be done by the
                                            &quot;container&quot; (to use Java
                                            parlance; or
                                            &quot;environment&quot;) &#8212; if
                                            you just have the app packaged in a
                                            nice way, the container (server
                                            environment, hosting service, etc)
                                            can handle all the system-specific
                                            things to make the application
                                            actually work.

                                            project, which defines something
                                            very much like this. Silver Lining
                                            isn&#8217;t <em>just</em> an
                                            application format, and things
                                            aren&#8217;t fully extracted along
                                            these lines, but it&#8217;s pretty
                                            close and it addresses a lot of
                                            important issues in the lifecycle of
                                            an application. To be clear: Silver
                                            Lining is an application packaging
                                            format, a server configuration
                                            library, a cloud server management
                                            tool, a persistence management tool,
                                            and a tool to manage the application
                                            with respect to all these services
                                            over time. It is a bunch of things,
                                            maybe too many things, so it is not
                                            unreasonable to pick out a smaller
                                            subset to focus on. Maybe an easy
                                            place to start (and good for Silver
                                            Lining itself) would be to separate
                                            at least the application format (and
                                            tools to manage applications in that
                                            state, e.g., installing new
                                            libraries) from the tools that make
                                            use of such applications (deploy,
                                            etc).

                                            Some opinions I have on this format,
                                            exemplified in Silver Lining:
                                        </p>
                                        <ul class="simple">
                                            <li>
                                                It&#8217;s not zipped or a
                                                single file, unlike WARs.
                                                Uploading zip files is not a
                                                great API. Geez. I know
                                                there&#8217;s this desire to
                                                &quot;just drop in a file&quot;;
                                                but there&#8217;s no getting
                                                around the fact that
                                                &quot;dropping a file&quot;
                                                becomes a

                                                maybe I&#8217;m getting ahead of

                                                tool that deploys should take as
                                                an argument a directory, not a
                                                single file. (If the tool then
                                                zips it up and uploads it,
                                                fine!)

                                                Configuration &quot;comes from
                                                the outside&quot;. That is, an
                                                application requests services,
                                                and the <em>container</em> tells
                                                the application where those
                                                services are. For Silver Lining
                                                I&#8217;ve used environmental
                                                variables. I think this one
                                                point is really important
                                                &#8212; the container
                                                <em>tells</em> the application.
                                                As a counter-example, an
                                                application that comes with a
                                                Puppet deployment recipe is
                                                essentially <em>telling</em> the
                                                server how to arrange itself to
                                                suit the application. This will
                                                never be reliable or simple!

                                                The application indicates what
                                                &quot;services&quot; it wants;
                                                for instance, it may want to
                                                have access to a MySQL database.
                                                The container then provides this
                                                to the application. In practice
                                                this means installing the actual
                                                packages, but also creating a
                                                database and setting up
                                                permissions appropriately. The
                                                alternative is never having
                                                <em>any</em> dependencies,
                                                meaning you have to use SQLite
                                                databases or ad hoc structures,
                                                etc. But in fact installing
                                                databases really isn&#8217;t
                                                that hard these days.

                                                as vendor libraries (they
                                                include non-portable binaries).

                                                names to install. Of course that
                                                would have to be abstracted
                                                some.

                                                It&#8217;s lame to try to test

                                                the frequent alternative. Also,
                                                it gives the application the
                                                chance to signal that the
                                                installation failed.

                                                sense of configuration. You
                                                don&#8217;t have to use this if

                                                like some simple sense of
                                                configuration would be helpful.

                                                are IMHO quite important and
                                                useful, but also need to be
                                                carefully specified.

                                                There&#8217;s a bunch of runtime
                                                expectations that aren&#8217;t
                                                part of the format, but in
                                                practice would be part of how
                                                the application is written. For
                                                instance, I make sure each app
                                                has its own temporary directory,
                                                and that it is cleared on
                                                update. If you keep session
                                                files in that location, and you
                                                expect the environment to clean
                                                up old sessions &#8212; well,
                                                either all environments should
                                                do that, or none should.

                                                The process model is not
                                                entirely clear. I tried to
                                                simply define one process model
                                                (unthreaded, multiple
                                                processes), but I&#8217;m not
                                                sure that&#8217;s suitable
                                                &#8212; most notably, multiple
                                                processes have a significant
                                                memory impact compared to
                                                threads. An application should
                                                at least be able to indicate
                                                what process models it accepts
                                                and prefers.

                                                would be at

                                                <em>good</em>, but putting all
                                                static files under one URL path
                                                (e.g.,
                                                <tt class="docutils literal"
                                                    ><span class="pre"

                                                as well. Maybe there should be
                                                conventions for both.

                                                Cron jobs are important. Though
                                                maybe they could just be yet
                                                another kind of service? Many
                                                extra features could be new
                                                services.

                                                Logging is also important;
                                                Silver Lining attempts to handle
                                                that somewhat, but it could be
                                                specified much better.

                                                Silver Lining also supports PHP,
                                                which seemed to cause a bit of
                                                stress. But just ignore that.
                                                It&#8217;s really easy to
                                                ignore.

                                            admittedly some other stuff that is
                                            only really specified in code; but
                                            in Silver Lining&#8217;s defense,
                                            specified in code is better than
                                            unspecified ;) App Engine provides
                                            another example of an application
                                            format, and would be worth using as
                                            a point of discussion or contrast (I
                                            did that myself when writing Silver
                                            Lining).

                                            Discussing WSGI stuff with Ben
                                            Bangert at PyCon he noted that he
                                            didn&#8217;t really feel like the
                                            WSGI pieces needed that much more
                                            work, or at least that&#8217;s not
                                            where the interesting work was
                                            &#8212; the interesting work is in
                                            the tooling. An application format
                                            could provide a great basis for
                                            building this tooling. And I
                                            honestly think that the tooling has
                                            been held back more by divergent
                                            patterns of development than by the
                                            difficulty of writing the tools
                                            themselves; and a good, general
                                            application format could fix that.

                                                It&#8217;s not easy to have
                                                expertise at multiple languages.
                                                But it&#8217;s not
                                                <em>that hard</em>. It&#8217;s
                                                considerably harder to have
                                                expertise at
                                                <em>multiple platforms</em>.
                                                Node.js gives you one language
                                                across client and server, but
                                                <em>not</em> one platform.
                                                Node.js programming
                                                doesn&#8217;t <em>feel</em> like
                                                the browser environment. They do
                                                adopt many conventions when
                                                it&#8217;s reasonable, but even
                                                then it&#8217;s not always the
                                                case &#8212; in particular
                                                because many browser APIs are
                                                the awkward product of C++
                                                programmers exposing things to
                                                Javascript, and you don&#8217;t
                                                want to reproduce those same
                                                APIs if you don&#8217;t have to
                                                (and Node.js doesn&#8217;t have
                                                to!) &#8212; an example is the
                                                event pattern in Node, which is
                                                similar to a browser but less
                                                obtuse.

                                                First: the same set of libraries
                                                is probably not applicable. If
                                                you can do it on the client then
                                                you probably don&#8217;t
                                                <em>have</em> to do it on the

                                                are useful. Can you really share
                                                them? Browser libraries are
                                                often hard to use elsewhere
                                                because they rely on browser
                                                APIs. These APIs are frequently

                                                <em>none</em> of which you can
                                                use in the browser.

                                                surmountable challenges, through
                                                modularity, mocking,
                                                abstractions, and so on&#8230;
                                                but ultimately I think the
                                                motivation is lacking: the

                                                with different expectations. Any
                                                vagueness about that boundary is
                                                <em>wrong</em>.

                                                perspective, as the security
                                                assumptions are nearly opposite
                                                on the two platforms. The client
                                                trusts itself, and the server
                                                trusts itself, and both should
                                                hold the other in suspicion
                                                (though the client can be more
                                                trusting because the
                                                <em>browser</em> doesn&#8217;t
                                                trust the client code).

                                                But it&#8217;s also the wrong
                                                way to treat HTTP. HTTP is
                                                pretty simple until you try to
                                                make it simpler. Efforts to make
                                                it simpler mostly make it more
                                                complicated. HTTP lets you send
                                                serialized data back and forth
                                                to a server, with a bunch of
                                                metadata and other do-dads. And
                                                that&#8217;s all neat, but you
                                                should always be thinking about
                                                <em>sending</em> information.
                                                And never
                                                <em>sharing</em> information.
                                                It&#8217;s not a fluid boundary,
                                                and code that touches HTTP needs
                                                to be explicit about it and not
                                                pretend it is equivalent to any
                                                other non-network operation.

                                                One of the things people
                                                frequently bring up is that you
                                                can validate data on the client
                                                and server using the same code.
                                                And of course, what web
                                                developer hasn&#8217;t been a

                                                to implement validation twice?

                                                Validation on the client is
                                                primarily a
                                                <em>user experience</em>
                                                concern, where you focus on
                                                bringing attention to problems
                                                with a form, and helping the
                                                user resolve those problems. You
                                                may be able to avoid errors
                                                entirely with an input method
                                                that avoids the problem (e.g.,
                                                if a you have a slider for a
                                                numeric input, you don&#8217;t

                                                Once the form is submitted, if
                                                you&#8217;ve done thorough
                                                client-side validation you can
                                                also avoid

                                                validation. Of course all your
                                                client-side validation could be
                                                avoided through a malicious
                                                client, but you don&#8217;t need
                                                to give a friendly error message
                                                in that case, you can simply
                                                bail out with a simple 400 Bad
                                                Request error.

                                                At that point there&#8217;s not

                                                Javascript is becoming
                                                increasingly less relevant, and
                                                if we aren&#8217;t

                                                It&#8217;s only a matter of
                                                time, the writing is on the
                                                wall. Depending on the project
                                                you might have to put in
                                                workarounds, but we should keep
                                                those concerns out of
                                                architecture decisions.
                                                Maintaining crazy hacks is
                                                <em>not</em> worth it.
                                                There&#8217;s so many terrible
                                                hacks that have turned into
                                                frameworks, and frameworks that
                                                have justified themselves
                                                because of the problems they
                                                solved that no longer

                                                I&#8217;m not saying Node.js is
                                                <em>bad</em>. There are other
                                                arguments for it, and you
                                                don&#8217;t need to make
                                                <em>any</em> argument for it if
                                                you just feel like using it.
                                                It&#8217;s fun to do something
                                                new. And I&#8217;m as optimistic
                                                about Javascript as anyone. But
                                                this one argument, I do not
                                                think it is very good.
