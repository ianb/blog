                                            I think the most interesting work in
                                            programming languages right now is
                                            about the <em>runtime</em>, not
                                            syntax or even the languages
                                            themselves. Which places PyPy in an
                                            interesting position, as they have
                                            put a great deal of effort into
                                            abstracting out the concept of
                                            runtime from the language they are
                                            implementing (Python).
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            There are of course other runtime
                                            environments available to Python.
                                            The main environment has and
                                            continues to be CPython &#8212; the
                                            runtime developed in parallel with
                                            the language, and with continuous
                                            incremental feedback and improvement
                                            by the Python developer community.
                                            It is the runtime that informs and
                                            is informed by the language.
                                            It&#8217;s also the runtime that is
                                            most easy-going about integrating
                                            with C libraries, and by extension
                                            it is part of the vague but
                                            important runtime environment of
                                            &quot;Unix&quot;. There&#8217;s also
                                            Jython and IronPython. I frankly
                                            find these completely uninteresting.
                                            They are runtimes controlled by
                                            companies, not communities, and the
                                            Python implementations are neither
                                            natural parts of their runtime
                                            environments, nor do the runtimes
                                            include many concessions to make
                                            themselves natural for Python.

                                            PyPy is somewhere different. It
                                            still has a tremendous challenge
                                            because Python was not developed
                                            <em>for</em> PyPy. Even small
                                            changes to the language seem
                                            impossible &#8212; something as
                                            seemingly innocuous as making
                                            builtins static seems to be stuck in
                                            a conservative reluctance to change.
                                            But unlike Jython and IronPython
                                            they aren&#8217;t stuck between a
                                            rock and a hard place; they just
                                            have to deal with the rock, not the
                                            hard place.

                                            So here is my unsolicited advice on
                                            what PyPy-the-runtime should
                                            consider. Simple improvements to
                                            performance and the runtime are
                                            fine, but being incrementally better
                                            than CPython only goes so far, and I
                                            personally doubt it will ever make a
                                            big impact on Python that way.

                                            PyPy should push hard on
                                            <em>concurrency</em> and
                                            <em>reliability</em>. If it is
                                            <em>fast enough</em> then
                                            that&#8217;s fine; that&#8217;s done
                                            as far as I&#8217;m concerned. I say
                                            this because I&#8217;m a web
                                            programmer, and speed is
                                            uninteresting to me. Certainly
                                            opinions will differ. But to me
                                            speed (as it&#8217;s normally
                                            defined) is really
                                            <em>really</em> uninteresting. When
                                            or if I care about speed I&#8217;m
                                            probably more drawn to Cython. I
                                            <em>do</em> care about latency,
                                            memory efficiency,
                                            scalability/concurrency, resource
                                            efficiency, and most of all
                                            <em>worst cases</em>. I don&#8217;t
                                            think a JIT addresses any of these
                                            (and can even make things worse). I
                                            don&#8217;t know of benchmarks that
                                            measure these parameters either.

                                            I want a runtime with new and novel
                                            features; something that isn&#8217;t
                                            just incrementally better than
                                            CPython. This itself might seem
                                            controversial, as the only point to
                                            such novel features would be for
                                            people to implement at least some
                                            code intended for
                                            <em>only</em> PyPy. But if the
                                            features are good enough then
                                            I&#8217;m okay with this &#8212; and
                                            if I&#8217;m not drawn to write
                                            something that will only work on
                                            PyPy, I probably won&#8217;t be
                                            drawn to use PyPy <em>at all</em>;
                                            natural conservatism and inertia
                                            will keep me (and most people) on
                                            CPython indefinitely.

                                                given us micro-threads, but
                                                it&#8217;s just not the same.
                                                Which is not entirely a
                                                criticism &#8212; it shows that
                                                unportable features

                                                then you can efficiently share

                                                to support this new model, than
                                                to abandon what could be
                                                PyPy&#8217;s best feature to

                                                extension ecosystem. Being a web
                                                programmer I honestly
                                                don&#8217;t need many C modules,
                                                so maybe I&#8217;m biased. But

                                                good enough then the C
                                                extensions will come.

                                                Python environment is solid.
                                                That might even mean a dangerous
                                                process mode that can handle
                                                ctypes and FFI and where you
                                                carefully write Python code that
                                                has extra powers, so long as
                                                there&#8217;s a strong wall
                                                between that code and
                                                &quot;general&quot; code that
                                                makes use of those services.

                                                it&#8217;s doing a lot of good
                                                stuff, and has a much more
                                                conservative but also more
                                                predictable path to performance
                                                (through things like type
                                                annotation). I think it&#8217;s
                                                worth leaning on. I also have
                                                something of a hunch that it
                                                could be a good way to do FFI in
                                                a safe manner, as Cython already
                                                supports multiple targets
                                                (Python 2 and 3) from the same
                                                codebase. Could PyPy be another
                                                target?

                                            With a runtime like this PyPy could
                                            be an absolutely rocking platform
                                            for web development. Python could be
                                            as reliable as, oh&#8230;

                                            of callbacks or Deferreds. And these

                                            So: I wouldn&#8217;t tell anyone
                                            what to do, and if someone tries
                                            this out I&#8217;ll probably only be
                                            on the sidelines cheering you
