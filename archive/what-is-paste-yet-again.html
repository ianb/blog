        <h1>What is Paste, yet again</h1>

        <div class="document">
            <p>
                The universal feedback I've received on paste attempts to define
                Paste is that no one got it. My fault. Anyway, since then I've
                started thinking differently about the composition of Paste and
                split it up in a different way. So, yet again, I try to explain
                what
                <a class="reference" href="http://pythonpaste.org">Paste</a> is:
            </p>
            <p><strong>Paste is just a name</strong></p>
            <p>
                OK, that's a dodge. Paste is stuff I think is important and
                underdeveloped elsewhere. But I can be more specific about the
                pieces...
            </p>
            <div class="section">

                    is a pluggable command-line script (called
                    <tt class="docutils literal"
                        ><span class="pre">paster</span></tt
                    >). Using plugins you can add new commands like
                    <tt class="docutils literal"
                        ><span class="pre">paster</span>

                    to it, either adding them globally or framework-local.
                    &quot;Framework&quot; doesn't necessarily mean web
                    framework, it can mean anything, including ad hoc commands
                    specific to a project.
                </p>
                <p>Paste Script provides two commands by default:</p>
                <ul class="simple">
                    <li>
                        <tt class="docutils literal"
                            ><span class="pre">paster</span>
                            <span class="pre">create</span></tt
                        >
                        is a command that creates or updates projects according
                        to some layout template. The templates themselves are
                        also pluggable. This is essentially the start-project
                        command already present in many recent frameworks.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <tt class="docutils literal"
                            ><span class="pre">paster</span>

                        is a command that loads Paste Deploy configuration files
                        (more about that later) and serves them up.

                </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="section">
                <h1>
                    <a id="paste-deploy" name="paste-deploy">Paste Deploy</a>

                    is a pluggable configuration-file loader for web
                    applications and servers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The &quot;plugins&quot; that you provide to Paste Deploy are
                    actually <em>factories</em> for applications and servers.
                    The configuration file will indicate what factory you want
                    to use, and then the arguments to send to the factory. This
                    is to say, the application and its configuration.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Factories themselves can be other configuration files, or
                    Python Egg entry points. That's part of

                    something good to understand. Ben Bangert had a post
                    describing

                </p>
                <p>
                    Paste Deploy is pretty simple when you get down to it --
                    it's just factories, passing in configuration data, and
                    returning a WSGI app. What's a WSGI app? Your framework
                    should be able to give you one of those -- if you are just
                    writing an application, you shouldn't have to know about the
                    details of WSGI. If your framework doesn't support WSGI,
                    then you should ask the framework authors to fix that.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Paste Deploy does implicitly encourage some specific
                    practices. One is that you keep your configuration separate
                    from your application. Hopefully the benefits are obvious,
                    but in practice this is not the norm in a lot of current
                    frameworks. Also, there are other tools (in Paste core which
                    I talk about next) which work better if your application is
                    well encapsulated and obeys the WSGI spec and uses WSGI
                    semantics (one common issue is respecting and properly
                    adjusting SCRIPT_NAME and PATH_INFO, though other ones come
                    up). These again are framework issues, but ones that several
                    frameworks do not currently get right.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Another feature of a Paste-Deploy-enabled application is
                    that it will have a simple factory that takes specific
                    arguments. So while it makes the application configurable,
                    it also makes it really easy to invoke the application
                    programmatically. This means that it should be easy to
                    create applications that embed each other, by delegating
                    some incoming requests to the embedded application.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Maybe I'll do a screencast on Paste Deploy sometime soon.
                    It's best feature, IMHO, is that it's actually quite simple,
                    and it maps to simple Python function invocation.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="section">
                <h1>
                    <a id="paste-the-rest" name="paste-the-rest"
                        >Paste (the rest)</a
                    >
                </h1>
                <p>
                    So there's another package called just &quot;Paste&quot;. It
                    has a bunch of tools. These tools are &quot;dead&quot;, in
                    that they don't magically appear in your environment, you
                    aren't forced to use them, and they mostly aren't required
                    in order to work with each other. The full list is described
                    on the
                    <a
                        class="reference"
                        href="http://pythonpaste.org/developer-features.html#overview"
                        >features</a
                    >
                    page.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You don't <em>have</em> to use any of these. Most of them
                    are of more interest to a framework developer than an
                    application programmer, and they are best used when adopted
                    into a framework. If you have an ad hoc framework then you
                    might be interested; if you aren't using some other
                    framework, you've likely built an ad hoc framework whether
                    you meant to or not. It's hard to program directly against
                    CGI, mod_python, or some other low-level system without
                    somehow creating a framework.
                </p>
                <p>
                    All the Paste parts use WSGI, because they are all intended
                    to be framework neutral, and there is no &quot;framework
                    neutral&quot; in Python web programming for much of this
                    functionality except for WSGI.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A number of the tools are &quot;WSGI middleware&quot;, which
                    means they wrap WSGI applications. What's a WSGI
                    application? Remember: if you aren't developing a framework
                    you shouldn't need to know, except to know that your
                    framework creates a WSGI application for you. But, back to
                    middleware -- it means that a request goes through the
                    middleware (which can modify it) and the response goes out
                    through the middleware (which can also modify the response).
                    This is how things like exception catching are implemented:
                </p>
                <ul class="simple">
                    <li>
                        The exception catcher wraps your app in
                        <tt class="docutils literal"
                            ><span class="pre">try:except:</span></tt
                        >
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If everything goes fine, it passed the request through,
                        and passes the response out without modification.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If your application raises an exception, it turns this
                        into an exception report, and depending on configuration
                        may email it to someone or just display it in the
                        browser.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    <em>But</em>, this is a framework concern. If you like the
                    exception catching middleware (because it's cool), then your
                    framework should adopt it, or at least allow for it, and it
                    should pass through configuration to that code. It's
                    probably not something that a modest application developer
                    will concern themselves with. Of course this is open source,
                    so everyone can be a framework contributor. In the end, if
                    you use lots of these Paste tools you can write a framework
                    from scratch with very little code. Your framework will be
                    all about creating an aesthetically cohesive wrapper around
                    the tools; Paste isn't a framework, WSGI isn't a framework,
                    they are just agreements, and tools that utilize those
                    agreements.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There are also some tools in Paste that are useful with
                    Paste Deploy, like something to map requests to
                    subapplications based on URL prefixes. It should be possible
                    to apply these to a well-encapsulated WSGI application
                    without problem, and so these are &quot;deployer&quot;
                    concerns, not application author or framework developer
                    concerns.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="section">
                <h1><a id="conclusion" name="conclusion">Conclusion</a></h1>
                <p>
                    So that's what Paste is. Maybe it makes more sense this
                    time.
                </p>
                <p>
                    One thing I'll note is that I think Paste Deploy is the most
                    important of these pieces. The other's are convenient, they
                    might make your development easier, but if they don't then
                    you shouldn't use them. But making your application
                    available through Paste Deploy makes life easier for
                    everything that wants to <em>use</em> your application. If,
                    say,
                    <a
                        class="reference"
                        href="http://checkandshare.com/catwalk/"
                        >CatWalk</a
                    >
                    was available through Paste Deploy, then I could embed it
                    into any application I write, even if I'm not using
                    TurboGears. If
                    <a
                        class="reference"
                        href="http://pyfilesync.berlios.de/pyfileserver.html"
                        >PyFileServer</a
                    >
                    was Paste Deploy enabled, then I could include a WebDAV
                    server with any app, etc. Paste Deploy is what starts to
                    address Python's flaws compared to PHP.

                    So is Paste Deploy like a <em>bootstrapper</em> for a
                    multiple service setup? It will import modules, instantiate
                    classes, get multiple servers up and running and connect
                    them to each other? Then the benefit over using native
                    configuration and startup for individual servers would be -
                    one unified way to do it. The servers still have to be able
                    to talk to each other.

                        Actually all the processes live in one process, so
                        there's only one server. When a request comes in, it is
                        dispatched to the appropriate application. Well, it
                        works with forking servers too, but the applications
                        still share a pool of processes in that case.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It would be cool to be able to spawn applications in
                        subprocesses, and I could actually see a lot of utility
                        in that, but it's not something that is possible now.

                        Paste Deploy does import modules for both application
                        and server, and then plug them together. Well... the
                        actual importing is typically done through Eggs (and
                        entry points), but that's the basic idea.

                            Ok - so it's like the QLime configuration module I
                            wrote earlier (no longer available). Would Paste
                            also instantiate <em>any</em> class I want and
                            attach it anywhere? Both Quixote and CherryPy
                            publish a tree of objects. In Quixote (don't know
                            about CherryPy) this 'tree' is build by Python code.
                            Do you think it would be useful if I could (via
                            configuration) specify how to build the published
                            tree? For example, instantiate
                            <tt class="docutils literal"
                                ><span class="pre">class</span>
                                <span class="pre"
                                    >someusermanager.User</span
                                ></tt
                            >
                            and attach it at
                            <tt class="docutils literal"
                                ><span class="pre">root.user</span></tt
                            >.

                                It doesn't use a tree of objects, so it's not
                                exactly like that.

                                matches URL prefixes and redirects them to
                                applications (which are in turn configured in
                                another section or file). It doesn't use any
                                kind of object publisher, so it doesn't
                                construct any set of objects. Internally the
                                application is free to parse the rest of the URL
                                using an object publisher. I find the
                                composition of distinct applications through
                                assignment to be... well, it makes the
                                applications no longer distinct. Monkeypatching
                                objects to make the resolver happy is... well,
                                not so hot either.

                                Typically an application will provide a simple
                                callable, that in turn will instantiate the
                                class. This can be provided by your framework,
                                or embedded in the application itself. Since
                                some frameworks don't have a root class, this
                                concept isn't built in. (e.g., some frameworks
                                simply have a root directory)

                    I think of Paste Deploy as building a &quot;WSGI
                    Stack&quot;, Paste Script as a way to call Paste Deploy from
                    the command line and create new projects and Paste as a
                    collection of WSGI middleware and utility functions. Are
                    people confused by Paste or WSGI servers/middleware/apps in
                    general?

                <p>
                    In any case, as the Paste stuff becomes more concrete and
                    there are more examples out there I think everyone will get
                    it.
