                Man, I wish I could script Mozilla extensions in Python. OK,

                distribute the results. Not as an applet or anything, but either
                (a) as a stand-alone application which used Mozilla as its
                runtime, or (b) as an extension (though the UI experience
                doesn't seem as good, because what <em>seems</em> like a
                independent application turns into a menu item in a browser).
                Actually, I really want both, as they both have use cases,

                I really <em>really</em> <strong>really</strong> wish I could do

                I make the same dream often, I think xft+pyxpcom can leverage
                scripting in python. A pity I have no time getting involved in
                this !

                This is not exactly what you want, and it is rather old, but at

                    +1. We need to build bridges between Python and Mozilla.
                    PyXPCom in particular needs to be fixed. For one thing, the
                    build process is excessively difficult, since the
                    instructions suggest you have to successfully build the
                    whole Mozilla beast in order to build PyXPCom. So just last
                    night I decided to work on this. It turns out someone has
                    already written a rough draft of a setup.py and patches for
                    the unicode incompatibility problems (Mozilla always uses
                    2-byte characters, but my build of Python uses 4-byte
                    characters.) With some hacking, the setup.py and patches
                    worked.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I plan to finish modernizing the patches and write the build
                    instructions within a few days. Then, if I decide to be
                    ambitious, I'm thinking about making the Mozilla suite
                    usable as a standard Python GUI, using a Wax-like interface.
                    That would give me something to present at PyCon 2006, if
                    someone else doesn't beat me to it. :-)

                That would be sweet (and save me from having to code in
                javascript ever :-) Right now part of the reason I still use
                Safari is that I can manipulate it via it's OSA dictionary
                (&quot;applescript&quot; the interface, not the language) from
                python ... so I have things like SessionSaver that actually
                work, and such.
