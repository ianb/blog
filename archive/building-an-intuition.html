                Many of the skills of a great software developer are rooted in a
                strong intuition -- intuition both about methodology and
                technique. Even though it's mysterious, I think intuition is
                very much something you build, you certainly aren't born with
                it. (Of course, some people may build it more quickly.)
                Intuition is the accumulated knowledge and wisdom when you've
                forgotten the source, or the accumulated result of lots of
                little lessons and learning experiences. And, we should all
                know, lessons are best learned through making mistakes.

                about something that I think it related:
            </p>
            <blockquote>
                What I like about this story [about solving a challenging
                problem in the development of Gnumeric], is that I could have
                given up at any point since there was a large problem ahead of
                me: a problem I had no answers to. And I see this with many free
                software developers, students and even in normal social
                situations: people stop doing things because they see a big
                problem ahead of them that they can not possibly conceive
                working around. My advise to every young programmer is to start
                writing code and delay addressing imaginary problems until they
                become real.
            </blockquote>
            <p>
                There's <em>always</em> a hard problem for which you won't have
                answers. When you become a better developer you will still
                always encounter these problems (at least if you are challenging
                yourself -- if not, then you need to find more challenging work,
                or make some work for yourself). I don't think any developer, no
                matter how great, will feel that they have Arrived, that their
                knowledge and skill is sufficient, because we can always dream
                of more than we can create. (Which is good, of course.)
            </p>
            <p>
                Besides tackling challenging problems -- and making mistakes --
                I think it's important to be opinionated about what you're
                doing. This applies to any craft, not just software. It's better
                to be rash and mistaken than to be withhold opinion, or to
                simply defer to the opinion of others. (Of course, none of this
                works if you are stubborn and won't change your opinion, because
                than you'll be stuck with premature and incorrect opinions.) But
                after making an opinion, you must of course be reflective and
                thoughtful, and have a bit of humility, so you can recognize
                where you were right and where you were wrong. And somewhere in
                this process you should be developing an intuition, but you
                probably won't realize its arrival, nor will ever be clear
                exactly where it came from.
