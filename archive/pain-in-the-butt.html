                I just wanted to look at
                <a class="reference" href="http://eunuchs.bkbits.net/"
                    >Eunuchs</a
                >
                -- I don't even know if I <em>care</em> about this package at
                this point, I just want to see what its scope is.
            </p>
            <p>
                Unfortunately, it appears like it only has a BitKeeper
                repository as its homepage. OK, looks prettier than ViewCVS,
                I'll just browse around... except all I can find are changesets,
                not the actual complete files. Am I missing something? OK, so I
                go to the download page, which tells me to download it via the
                <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">bk</span></tt> tool. Well,
                of course,
                <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">bk</span></tt> is not
                packaged as part of Debian, because it's very un-free.
            </p>
            <p>
                So I have to do some stupid email verification just to get
                access to the download, then I get some stupid binary installer
                that just goes throwing files on my system, and then insists on
                linking all its files into
                <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">/usr/bin</span></tt
                >, not
                <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">/usr/local/bin</span></tt>
                as it should -- but at least they are only symlinks. Then on
                first invocation there's some stupid license.
            </p>
            <p>
                Stupid proprietary tools. Only now do I realize there's a Debian
                package
                <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">python-eunuchs</span></tt
                >, even if it is a little out of date.
            </p>
            <p>
                I didn't read the license very well. I think for good measure
                I'm going to delete the thing, which hopefully gets rid of any
                obligations in the license. Stupid proprietary tools.

            Yeah, I went to look at it to see what it was about, and was
            immediately turned off by the complete lack of *any* information
            about the package. The PyPI record has some info though, as a
            teaser:
            <br />

            <br />
            <a href="http://python.org/pypi?:action=display" target="_blank"
                >http://python.org/pypi?:action=display</a
            >=python-eunuchs=0.0.0
            <br />

            <br />
            OK, granted, this is a 0.0.0 release, which I guess could be taken
            as an annoucement of intention, I guess ;)
            <br />

            <br />
            Hmm. Must migrate PyPI to postgres soon.

            Hmm. comment display code mangled the URL. Here 'tis as a "proper
