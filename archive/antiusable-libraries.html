                PyCon presentation:
            </p>
            <blockquote>
                Imagine if the Perl cafe and Javahut were across the street from
                each other. You walk into Javahut, and ask to sit down.
                &quot;I'm sorry,&quot; says the person at the door. I'm not
                actually the hostess, I'm a Factory class that can give you a
                hostess if you tell me what type of seat you want.&quot; You say
                you want a non-smoking seat, and the person calls over a
                NonSmokingSeatHostess. The hostess takes you to your seat, and
                asks if you'll want breakfast, lunch, or dinner. You say lunch,
                and she beckons a LunchWaitress. The LunchWaitress takes your
                order, brings over your food, but there's no plates to put it on
                because you forgot to get a CutleryFactory and invoke getPlates,
                so the Waitress throws a null pointer exception and you get
                thrown out of the place.
            </blockquote>

                Anyway, I need to go finish my notes on my presentation (slides
                alone are entirely useless).
