        <h1>Dealing with Context</h1>
        <p>
            I'm writing some code where every action has a context. Mostly this
            is to track who does what in a multi-user system, as well as some
            logging and preferences.
        </p>

        <p>
            Usually when you have a bunch of state that gets passed around, that
            state is "self", a sort of implicit first argument to all your
            functions. This works well in the scope of a class, but what about
            when you have many classes, and many methods that need to share some
            state?
        </p>

        <p>
            Currently I'm passing a context object around as the first argument
            to many of these methods. More than would seem immediately
            necessary, as it's easier to pass the context around now than
            realize that some deep method needs the context, and a whole chain
            of method signatures have to be changed to pass the context in.
        </p>

        <p>
            In the end I don't really like any of it. This argument feels like a
            wart on every method. Are there other ways to pass around context?
        </p>

        <p>
            Zope 2 does this through Acquisition, which takes the form of a
            wrapper around nearly every object you deal with, and the wrapper
            adds the contextual information. Acquisition is evil for other
            reasons, but it works fairly well here.
        </p>

        <p>
            Other systems use global variables for this context. That works well
            in a single-process system. What about a threaded system? I could
            key the context off the thread name, creating a kind of
            system-local/thread-global value. I've never felt confident about
            doing that, though.
        </p>

        <p>
            Other techniques? I don't really know what Zope 3 is doing for this
            -- I feel like adaptation is somehow involved, but there's got to be
            more to it than that.
        </p>

            Rather than passing it to every function, you can make a global
            "context server" that any function that needs the context can
            access. You could make a module that handles this (which will
            automatically be global) and have methods on it. For multi-threaded
            access, the module can handle locking if you need that, so clients
            can block while you're making changes to the context. (Does this
            make sense, or am I missing something?)
            <br />

            <br />
            The point is that if something needs to be passed to *many*
            different functions, objects, or methods, it's probably an aspect of
            the *system* that everyone should have easy access to, not something
            that should be shuffled along the call stack.

            By multithreaded, I don't just mean threadsafe, but that each thread
            has its own context. So I can't just put it in a global data
            structure, unless that structure is somehow parameterized by thread.
            Which is pretty doable -- threading.currentThread().getName() seems
            to return a good key -- but I'm not sure I feel entirely comfortable
            with that. Maybe I shouldn't worry and it'll be fine, but since it
            will be a central component I don't want to find later that it was a
            really bad idea ;)

            Re: aspects; I would be a little fearful to use aspects for
            something like this, as it's almost global to the application, and
            would mean all the code would get touched. Since aspect-oriented
            programming seems to work on a source-level (actually transforming
            the source), that could mean all sorts of crazy results. Most
            aspect-oriented use cases are things that strike me as a response to
            an inflexible language, and usually not necessary for Python, so
            hopefully that level of effort isn't necessary.

            ian: the stuff with using currentThread as a key is exactly what I
            do with TooFPy to put stuff into a thread-bound context. This isn't
            a guarantee that this is the best idea one can have, but at least
            you won't be alone to feel the pain if things blow up in our faces
            ;-)

            (I have nothing to do with it but) Zope 3 has a nicely abstracted
            thread globals approach, actually. I think I remember hearing it was
            the same sort of key approach. It's in a C extension, and has some
            docs and unit tests. Check in
            <a

            that's not 'zope.app' is intended to be used outside of the zope app
            server. Dependencies are specified in DEPENDENCIES.cfg in each
            package--I don't think the thread code has any.

            Three issues about the threading:
            <br />

            <br />
            1) threading.currentThread() returns a new-style object, so for
            simple needs, you can just add attr's to it.
            <br />

            <br />
            2) If you're going to roll your own mapping keyed off of
            currentThread(), you might as well skip all of the threading-module
            overhead and just use thread.get_ident() directly.
            <br />

            <br />
            3) I've had serious issues with e.g. mod_python reusing thread id's
            in concurrently running threads (!). So be careful. One of these
            days, I need to track that buglet down... :(

            I'm a big Nevow fan (I also wrote some recipes about Nevow in the
            Cookbook). By design Nevow passes 2 arguments to its methods:
            <br />

            <br />
            a context, which represents the current object space state
            <br />

            <br />
            a data argument, which contains the return value from the data_*
            method.
            <br />

            <br />
            Using the context you can pretty much do anything, also remembering
            objects with a precise interface that can be retrieved later, here
            is a little example of how this would work:
            <br />

            <br />
            class Page(rend.Page):
            <br />
            def render_stuff(self, context, data):
            <br />
            context.remember(data, ISomeData)
            <br />

            <br />
            Which can be retrieved later with:
            <br />

            <br />
            class SecondPage(rend.Page):
            <br />
            def render_otherStuff(self, context, data):
            <br />
            my_data = context.locate(ISomeData)
            <br />

            <br />
            In the context is stored every information about the connection,
            like the request object:
            <br />

            <br />
            request = context.locate(IRequest)
            <br />

            <br />
            Also the Session is there:
            <br />

            <br />
            session = context.locate(ISession)
            <br />

            <br />
            and the current processed tag from the template:
            <br />

            <br />
            context.tag
            <br />

            <br />
            I think this is the most complete implementation of 'passing a
            context around'.

            This adaptation thing might be getting out of hand ;) Really,
            <tt>context.locate(ISession)</tt> is just like attribute access,
            except the attributes themselves have namespaces (i.e.,
            <tt>ISession</tt> belongs to a namespace, where
            <tt>'ISession'</tt> wouldn't). I'm not sure how I feel about that.
            (And why <tt>context.locate(ISession)</tt> instead of
            <tt>ISession(context)</tt>?)
            <a
                href="http://blog.colorstudy.com/ianb/weblog/2003/10/12.html#P12"
                target="_blank"
                >I thought</a
            >
            that adaptation and traversal overlap considerably, though I'm still
            not sure what it means or how it helps. Why
            <tt>context.remember(data, ISomeData)</tt> instead of
            <tt>context.someData = data</tt>? Except maybe the namespace thing,
            are namespaces <i>really</i> that important?
            <br />

            <br />
            Anyway, I'm glad to see that thread-local data is going to be built
            in to Python. That way at least I can implement a simpler
            thread-local system, knowing that even if the particular techniques
            I use aren't perfect there will be a well-supported, analogous
            technique in the future. (I don't want to deal with a C extension at
            the moment.)

            ISession and other various interfaces are in a separate module, I
            just directly wrote the interface name for verbosity needs ;)
            <br />

            <br />
            In this specific case the interface is used just like a name.
            <br />

            <br />
            def remember(self, adapter, interface=None):
            <br />
            """Remember an object that implements some interfaces.
            <br />
            Later, calls to .locate which are passed an interface implemented
            <br />
            by this object will return this object.
            <br />

            <br />
            If the 'interface' argument is supplied, this object will only
            <br />
            be remembered for this interface, and not any of
            <br />
            the other interfaces it implements.
            <br />
            """
            <br />
            if interface is None:
            <br />
            interfaceList = megaGetInterfaces(adapter)
            <br />
            if not interfaceList:
            <br />
            interfaceList = [dataqual]
            <br />
            else:
            <br />
            interfaceList = [qual(interface)]
            <br />
            if self._remembrances is None:
            <br />
            self._remembrances = {}
            <br />
            for interface in interfaceList:
            <br />
            self._remembrances[interface] = adapter
            <br />
            return self
            <br />

            <br />
            This is the specific context.remember() implementation inside Nevow.
            So Adaptation doesn't come into play with this example although it
            may seems at first glance. This is also why ISession(context) is not
            a way of having the session object from the context, since providing
            ISession with context would require context providing also IRequest,
            IHand and a lot more (user needed also) interfaces, which can't be
            done, also, you would end up with a huge context class that provides
            a method for every method of a request/session/so_on. As you can
            see, instead, interfaces are rather a key inside a dict.
            <br />

            <br />
            context.someData = data
            <br />

            <br />
            could have been used actually, but since context.someData is not
            namespaced you can have some collisions (remember that using
            context.remember() you give the user the possibility to remember all
            the objects he needs to, so I can have some collisions).
            <br />

            <br />
            HTH, I should post more on my blog actually... :P

            Ian, you are right on target with your observations.
            <br />

            <br />
            First, interfaces were chosen instead of strings (for example,
            implementing __getattr__ on Context) because they are namespaced.
            <br />

            <br />
            Second, ISession(ctx) should absolutely be used instead of
            ctx.locate(ISession), and I plan on implementing that soon in my
            copious spare time.
            <br />

            <br />
            Finally, context objects in nevow are chained in order to keep track
            of state across asynchronous callbacks. context.remember remembers
            an object for an interface at that particular context, and
            context.locate (or eventually IFoo(ctx)) searches through this
            parent chain if that particular interface isn't immediately
            available. This allows me to do things like:
            <br />

            <br />
            - reuse context objects across multiple page renders (in the case
            where a template is precompiled and certain things happen once but
            other things happen every page render)
            <br />

            <br />
            - implement locate() in different ways in different places; the
            normal Context objects used to represent a DOM node implement locate
            as described above, but other IContext implementors implement it by
            directly returning some object or by being a factory for interface
            implementors
            <br />

            <br />
            - implement very explicit acquisition, should anyone choose to use
            it. Before writing Woven and Nevow I wrote a few very large
            applications in Zope and was struck by the power and simplicity of
            in-a inheritance, but burned a few times by it's implicitness. Thus,
            I wanted to build in a way to pass information from parent to
            children pages into nevow. The context chain is used to accomplish
            this.
            <br />

            <br />
            Also, twisted.python.context is relevant to this discussion. It is
            used to implicitly pass state during the execution of a function,
            and it uses some form of thread identity checking to provide a
            unique context to each thread. (Read the implementation, it is
            short.) It is used like this:
            <br />

            <br />
            <tt>
                <br />
                from twisted.python import context
                <br />

                <br />
                context.call({'any keys': 'any values'}, someFunction,
                someArgument, someKeyword='argument')
                <br />
            </tt>
            <br />

            <br />
            Then later, during the execution of someFunction or any function
            called by someFunction:
            <br />

            <br />
            <tt>
                <br />
                from twisted.python import context
                <br />

                <br />
                context.get('any keys')
                <br />
            </tt>
            <br />

            <br />
            Thanks for the interesting blog posts as always!

            Uuuhhh... I feel happy now that I know I was wrong about adaptation
            in remembrance. I'm looking forward the day I will be able to write
            ISession(context).

            I think there is often a good case for explicitly passing around a
            context object,
            <br />
            just because it's explicit. I've seen enough problems with
            acquisition contexts
            <br />
            in Zope 2 to appreciate this -- Zope 2 doesn't hide it perfectly,
            which means you have to
            <br />
            understand contexts anyway to use it, and the trickery only becomes
            more voodoo-like ('__of__',
            <br />
            'aq_inner', etc). An explicit context has the important benefit in
            that it is *simple*.
            <br />

            <br />
            You can sometimes reduce the amount of context being passed around
            by making context an
            <br />
            instance variable and centralizing instance construction so that the
            context is passed
            <br />
            through upon creation. I know that's vague, but it's a pattern I
            sometimes see.

            In java the Aspects can work at bytecode level too but i don't know
            if this is posible in python.
            <br />

            I agree with Martijn Faassen. Either keep it explicit, or make it an
            attribute. If only a few methods need it, leave it as a parameter to
            the methods. Otherwise, make it a parameter to the constructor. If
            you're just passing context along to some other dependent objects,
            maybe consider making it an attrobute of those objects instead.
            <br />

            <br />
            Another way of looking at it is like this: Say you started with a
            bunch of ordinary functions (no objects). You realized after awhile
            that all of these functions took at least the same three parameters.
            So, you make a class to encapsulate those three parameters, and thus
            make the "context" of those functions (now methods) implicit. Now,
            time goes by, and you realize that you're passing yet another
            parameter to all (or almost all) of these functions. This additional
            parameter, unfortunately named "context" as well, looks like it's
            part of this class's encapsulated context as well. So, move it into
            the class, along with the first three. Granted, this is a very
            mechanical view of OO, but it often works for me.
            <br />

            <br />
            I don't know your specific situation, so this is all based on an
            abstract notion I have of your real problem, but I'd be skeptical of
            any metaprogramming solution to--what seems to me--too simple of a
            problem to warrant it.
