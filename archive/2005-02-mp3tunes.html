        <h1>Review: mp3tunes.com</h1>

        <div class="document">
            <p>
                With the start of
                <a class="reference" href="http://mp3tunes.com">mp3tunes.com</a
                >, I thought I should give it a try. I've used iTunes Music
                Service a couple times. I think I confused Apple with Google and
                thought they had a <em>don't be evil</em> motto. Not that they
                have a <em>be evil</em> motto, but they don't have anywhere near
                the kind of respect for their customers that Google shows.
                Visual design isn't the same thing as respect. In this case I
                was burned with my iTMS purchases -- for some reason I lost my
                authorization and couldn't burn the audio to disk, and of course
                I can't play their encrypted songs on Linux (it is
                <em>possible</em> to play m4a's, but not easy, and certainly not
                encrypted AAC files). And I couldn't get the
                <a class="reference" href="http://hymn-project.org/">Hymn</a> to
                work either. But really that was just a last attempt to steal
                back the music their DRM stole from me -- I already knew I
                wasn't going to sink any more money into a service that found me
                guilty of copyright infringement until I proved innocent. And
                they simply offer no value over actual CDs -- they cost the same
                if you consider that you don't get as much product (no actual
                CD, no liner notes). The only benefit is being able to buy
                individual songs, but I generally like albums anyway.
            </p>
            <p>
                I've been using
                <a class="reference" href="http://allofmp3.com">allofmp3.com</a>
                some, and
                <a
                    class="reference"
                    href="apple-microsoft-some-random-russian-company.html"
                    >talked about that</a
                >
                before. Their prices are great (even if they did go up
                recently), the site is workable, the payment system sometimes a
                little indirect (but always secure), the audio formats just
                about ideal for anyone, their collection of music is incomplete
                and quirky (it's got to be the best
                <a
                    class="reference"
                    href="http://catalog.allofmp3.com/mcatalog.shtml?group=4853&amp;albref=14"
                    >Frank Zappa collection</a
                >
                available online anywhere!), and the legality is somewhat
                questionable.
            </p>
            <p>
                So I like them, I don't feel bad about using them. But there's a
                lot of music I can't get there, and I feel a little funny
                linking to them if I refer to a musician or CD -- I know I'm not
                really supporting the musicians, and they deserve support. When
                Metallica gets in a huff my
                <a
                    class="reference"
                    href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utilitarianism"
                    >utilitarian ethic</a
                >
                doesn't give me much sympathy for them. But Metallica is hardly
                representative of the kind of musicians I like.
            </p>
            <p>
                Anyway, I'm happy mp3tunes offers another alternative, one where
                neither artists nor I am deprived. For my first purchase I got
                <a
                    class="reference"
                    href="http://www.mp3tunes.com/ReginaSpektor"
                    >Regina Spektor</a
                >, who I heard on NPR (listening to her again, she sounds a lot
                like Fiona Apple).
            </p>
            <p>My review of the site:</p>
            <ul class="simple">
                <li>It's a little sluggish, but I expect that to improve.</li>
                <li>
                    The search isn't very good, it seems too optimistic. I wish
                    it knew about artists that weren't available so I could
                    quickly confirm what was and wasn't available, without
                    second guessing the accuracy of the search results
                    themselves. If I'm looking for a specific artist you won't
                    lose my purchase if you admit you don't have them -- there's
                    no chance I'm going to choose a similarly-named artist
                    instead.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The samples are MP3s, <em>not</em> Real or Windows Media,
                    which makes me very happy -- I have never been able to get
                    Real to work on Linux, and even on machines where I can get
                    Real to work I hate it.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Once purchased you have to download each song individually
                    through the browser (click, save-to-disk), which is annoying
                    -- at least allofmp3.com gives a list of links you can feed
                    to
                    <a
                        class="reference"
                        href="http://www.gnu.org/software/wget/wget.html"
                        >wget</a
                    >. A zip file to download would be excellent as well. I
                    don't know what limits their are on download -- songs don't
                    disappear as I download them. (Since allofmp3 charges for
                    bandwidth, not by song, their download model is much
                    different.)
                </li>
                <li>
                    The selection doesn't seem too good, it seems to be a
                    coincidence that the first artist I looked for was in the
                    system (but only one of her CDs, and not the most recent
                    one). I'm hoping that improves as well.
                    <a class="reference" href="http://www.emusic.com/"
                        >eMusic</a
                    >
                    could have been cool if it didn't end up specializing in the
                    obscure. If mp3tunes grows from the bottom up -- adding
                    small artists and labels first -- that would be OK by me. It
                    will work much better if we (the
                    <a
                        class="reference"
                        href="http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/12.10/tail.html"
                        >long tail</a
                    >) support that selection.
                </li>
                <li>
                    From one long tail to another, they could do more to help me
                    help them. There isn't as much metadata as I'd like. I want
                    links to artist websites. I wish they could link to
                    <a class="reference" href="http://allmusic.com">Allmusic</a
                    >, but that probably requires a license. (That would be
                    awesome if they relicensed the content -- maybe they could
                    improve on Allmusic's shitty website design.) If I'm going
                    to link to their pages, I want those pages to offer more
                    than just a way to purchase the music; I want those pages to
                    be a good portal for the reader to learn more about the
                    musician.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                I think it's important to support this effort -- not so much for
                freedom (it's not
                <a class="reference" href="http://creativecommons.org/">CC</a
                >-licensed works or anything) but simply setting a standard of
                reasonable consumer rights. DRM is simply unacceptable.
