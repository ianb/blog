                So, I was trying to improve
                <a class="reference" href="http://pythonpaste.org/commentary/"
                    >Commentary</a
                >
                with respect to its HTML processing. I was parsing the incoming
                page with
                <a class="reference" href="http://tidy.sourceforge.net/">tidy</a
                >, reading it with
                <a
                    class="reference"
                    href="http://effbot.org/zone/element-index.htm"
                    >ElementTree</a
                >
                and then writing it back out. But tidy was leaving some entities
                in there that Expat didn't understand, and ElementTree was
                outputing XML that doesn't look like HTML. I think I have it
                fixed (maybe), but it was all much harder than it should have
                been.
            </p>
            <p>
                I first started with
                <a
                    class="reference"
                    href="http://python.org/doc/current/lib/module-xml.dom.minidom.html"
                    >minidom</a
                >, (or
                <a class="reference" href="http://pyxml.sourceforge.net/"
                    >PyXML</a
                >?) because I wanted to implement the same algorithms in
                Javascript, so I preferred a DOM interface. This worked for a
                little while, but from what I can tell minidom is just really
                really broken.
                <tt class="docutils literal"
                    ><span class="pre">getElementById</span></tt
                >
                didn't work, and after looking at the code it seemed like it
                <em>couldn't</em> work given the way I was creating the DOM;
                which was the only way I saw to create the DOM -- there's
                basically no useful documentation for that module, which is a
                problem when it doesn't work as claimed. Then later I was
                getting a problem with inserting nodes, because you can't insert
                a document-type node (only elements and text nodes and
                whatnot)... except from what I could tell of the source it was
                just utterly and completely wrong, and was testing the node type
                against ELEMENT_TYPE. These are such glaringly obvious errors
                that I didn't know what to make of them; did I completely not
                understand what I was doing? Is this code just completely
                abandoned and unloved?
            </p>
            <p>
                Anyway, I felt okay about the algorithm by that time anyway,
                worked around the problems, and then reimplemented using
                ElementTree. This introduced some problems, because ElementTree
                doesn't use a model much like the DOM. In the DOM every node
                knows about its siblings, parent, etc. Elements in ElementTree
                don't know about any of that (which is conventional in Python
                and most languages, that you not know about your container). But
                that was inconvenient, so I had to make a wrapper to give me
                access to that information.
            </p>
            <p>
                Then there's the issue that there's no code I know of that knows
                how to parse HTML (<a
                    class="reference"
                    href="http://python.org/doc/current/lib/module-HTMLParser.html"
                    >HTMLParser</a
                >
                does, of course, but not in a useful way -- it doesn't create a
                tree). So everyone uses Tidy to normalize their code to XHTML,
                which works but feels really sloppy. HTML is parseable; in this
                case, I really only wanted to parse well-formed HTML anyway.
                Then, finally, there's builtin way to serialize ElementTree to
                HTML from what I can find. There's some hints, but they still
                leave you with empty elements like
                <tt class="docutils literal"
                    ><span class="pre">&lt;a</span>
                    <span class="pre">name=&quot;foo&quot;</span>
                    <span class="pre">/&gt;</span></tt
                >, which browsers do <em>not</em> like. I had to clone a
                <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">write</span></tt>
                method in ElementTree and make edits to it.
            </p>
            <p>
                I have to say, Javascript and the DOM in the browsers are
                <em>much</em> easier to use for HTML processing, even taking
                into account the fact that it's Javascript.

                    When you run tidy on the way in, you need to use
                    &quot;-n&quot; (numeric entities) and &quot;-asxml&quot;.
                    ElementTree's XML serializer isn't well suited for a tag
                    soup parser (HTML needs special treatment of many tags), so
                    you need to grab a HTML serializer for ET. There's a nice
                    one in Kid.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Alternatively, you can use tidy on the way out to; feeding
                    the XML through &quot;tidy -xml&quot; should work.

                        I looked at Kid's, and was a little confused by the
                        iterating over events/tokens that it used. I wasn't
                        really clear what that internal data structure was. I
                        ended up creating an
                        <tt class="docutils literal"
                            ><span class="pre">ElementTree</span></tt
                        >
                        subclass
                        <tt class="docutils literal"

                        >
                        in
                        <a

                            >dumbpath</a
                        >. It might leave out things that Kid does, but it
                        mostly makes sure that empty elements don't get
                        <tt class="docutils literal"
                            ><span class="pre">/&gt;</span></tt
                        >
                        and that all other elements use both opening and closing
                        tags. And it strips namespaces.

                    <p>
                        An HTML serializer would be a nice addition to
                        <tt class="docutils literal"

                        >, since reading and writing HTML are operations that
                        often go together.

                    One wishlist item is to expose libxml2's HTML parser to lxml
                    somehow. Volunteers are welcome. :) We already have a patch
                    lying around implementing serialization support. I should
                    find the time to review/integrate it all and prepare another
                    release...

                    You've basically got to load in the HTML DTD if you expect
                    getElementById to work.

                        That, um, sucks. Geez... the only reason the DOM seems
                        useful to me is that it is implemented in browsers. I'm
                        sure it's implemented and widely used elsewhere (I
                        guess, I don't actually hear people talking about it),
                        but the primary implementation in my mind has always
                        been browsers. Or raise an exception when
                        <tt class="docutils literal"
                            ><span class="pre">getElementById</span></tt
                        >
                        can't return a meaningful value. At <em>least</em> it
                        should indicate in the documentation how you make it act
                        like the browser's implementation. But eh... ET is much
                        more predictable and seems to have relatively few
                        intricacies. And it's going to be in the standard
                        library (w00t!), so I'll probably just choose to forget
                        that xml.minidom even exists.

                    You probably already ran across it but Frederik Lundh also

                    which conveniently wraps up calling tidy on some HTML, and
                    returns an ElementTree tree.

                    &quot;&quot;&quot;I have to say, Javascript and the DOM in
                    the browsers are much easier to use for HTML processing,
                    even taking into account the fact that it's
                    Javascript.&quot;&quot;&quot;

                <p>
                    It'll be even much easier once all browsers support E4X :)
