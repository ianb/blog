        <p>
            I'm starting to write some sample applications and middleware (<a
                href="http://blog.colorstudy.com/ianb/weblog/2004/08/22.html#P150"

        <p>
            It's probably not the best example, but here's the hello-world
            application I wrote for this:
        </p>

        <pre>
import cgi

def application(environ, start_response):
    form = cgi.FieldStorage(fp=environ['wsgi.input'],
                            environ=environ,
                            keep_blank_values=1)
    write = start_response('200 OK', [('Content-type', 'text/html')])
    if form.getvalue('name'):
        write('&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;title&gt;Hello!&lt;/title&gt;&lt;/head&gt;\n')
        write('&lt;body&gt;\n')
        write('&lt;h1&gt;Hello %s!&lt;/h1&gt;\n' % form['name'].value)
    else:
        write('&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;title&gt;Who is there?&lt;/title&gt;&lt;/head&gt;\n')
        write('&lt;body&gt;\n')
        write('&lt;h1&gt;Who is there?&lt;/h1&gt;\n')
    write('&lt;form action="%s" method="POST"&gt;\n' % environ['SCRIPT_NAME'])
    write('What is your name?&lt;br&gt;\n')
    write('&lt;input type="text" name="name" value="%s"&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n'
          % cgi.escape(form.getvalue('name', ''), 1))
    write('&lt;input type="submit" value="That is my name"&gt;&lt;/form&gt;\n')
    write('&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\n')
    return None
</pre
        >

        In most cases you wouldn't be writing your application on this level,
        but it's really no worse than the
        <a href="http://python.org/doc/current/lib/module-cgi.html"
            >cgi module</a
        >
        (which isn't very good, but eh).

        <p>
            Something like
            <a
                href="http://colorstudy.com/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/trunk/WSGI/cgitb_catcher.py?rev=201&view=markup"
                >cgitb_catcher</a
            >
            is maybe a bit more interesting -- it provides
            <a href="http://python.org/doc/current/lib/module-cgitb.html"
                >cgitb</a
            >

            Hm, I just skimmed trough the pep and looked at your example. Is it
            right that the primary focus of WSGI is the response, and not the
            request?
            <br />
            You still use the cgi-module to retrieve the get/post parameters. I
            don't think that all kinds of servers realy support the
            cgi-interface, or guarantee it to be correct when not invoking a cgi
            ( in the dark mysts of my mind ther's some faint doubt about this
            cgi-thingy working with mod_python )
            <br />
            I understand that the WSGI should be kept as simple as possible. But
            I do not realy see the point of it when I still have to write server
            specific code just in order to get hold of the parameters ( which is
            apart from the reply the most profane task of a dynamic web-page )
            <div align="right">

            I use the cgi module to <i>parse</i> the request, specifically the
            query string. This is one of cgi's undocumented features (well, it's
            only documented in cgi.py, in the docstrings). I pass it an explicit
            environment (which includes the query string) and file-in. It will
            work quite well with mod_python -- it's not using stdin or
            os.environ. Though an application coded <i>for</i> mod_python might
            be a bit harder, as such an application might use mod_python
            features that WSGI doesn't include.
            <br />

            <br />
            It's expected that you won't code your application to WSGI directly,
            but use some framework or library to make it a bit easier to work
            with. The cgi is one such library, though it's not a very good one.

            I must admit to have been a bit disappointed by the WSGI drafts. The
            first thing I noticed was that the documentation was confusing; 2
            examples are given that are 'Much the same thing' except it quickly
            becomes apparent that no, they're quite different and use different
            approaches. I think that draft needs looking over by a neutral third
            party who is going to hammer it into something more readable. The
            second thing was that I couldn't really see this benefitting a lot
            of people. As a web application developer currently using
            mod_python, this doesn't help me significantly. After all, 'freeing'
            my application from the mod_python/Apache dependency is another way
            of losing me the other benefits it brings such as smart module
            reloading, easier HTTP status handling, automatically parsed URIs
            and query strings, session management and so on. If someone was to
            standardise those features across various webserver implementations
            - features that PHP and ASP users take for granted - then I would be
            much happier.

            I agree that a standard of the more high-level tasks would add much
            to the usability, yet it makes the standard harder to implement for
            the maintainers of web-frameworks.
            <br />

            <br />
            Maybe it would help to see this as a sort of first stage standard,
            which is later extended to a wsig 1.1 that includes some more
            features. This way wsig is still easely implemented, yet it offers a
            specific way to the next step, as soon as the respective maintainer
            has some more spare time.

            Folks, the place for discussing the PEP or proposing changes is the
            Web-SIG mailing list.
            <br />

            <br />
            But as long as I'm here, I'll answer the question about
            "single-threaded", by quoting the PEP:
            <br />

            <br />
            """so that applications or frameworks that are not thread-safe may
            still be used with that server."""
            <br />

            <br />
            Anyway, "shoulds" are recommendations, not requirements. A server
            can fail to provide this facility and still be considered
            conforming.
            <br />

            <br />
            As for the examples "that are 'Much the same thing'", I agree that
            it should be rephrased to say that the two examples produce the same
            output, but are implemented differently, using a variety of WSGI
            features.
            <br />

            <br />
            As for the looking over by other persons, I've previously asked for
            diffs/patches proposing rephrasings; only one person has actually
            given me any thus far, although Ian has at least also provided
            suggestions in in-line replies. This thing is over 1000 lines long
            now, and it's getting more and more difficult to find stuff when
            people say, "oh the stuff about X and Y was confusing", especially
            if they don't propose an alternative phrasing!
            <br />

            <br />
            Anyway, I've submitted an updated draft to the PEPs editor, so it
            will be in Python CVS soon, which will make it easier to make and
            use patches.
            <br />

            <br />
            Finally, I should mention that at this stage, the benefits of WSGI
            are primarily for web *framework* authors, and web *server* authors,
            not web *application* authors. This is *not* an application API,
            it's a framework-to-server glue API. It doesn't compete with any
            existing framework APIs.
            <br />

            <br />
            It does, however, form a basis for future web APIs to be
            "plug-and-play" and "mix-and-match". But that day is still a ways
            off, and we won't reach it if framework and server authors don't
            implement this first stage.
            <br />

            A couple points:
            <br />

            <br />
            Phillip is working on another draft, mostly trying to make some of
            the text easier to understand.
            <br />

            <br />
            Thread support: I think it's a little weird too, as it's mostly just
            broken if you are running without threads in a single process. I'm
            not entirely sure how well this would support an asynchronous
            application, which would allow single-process, single-thread
            concurrent programs. Right now environ['wsgi.input'] only is
            specified to have a blocking interface (AFAICT). This may be the
            only place that's a problem, and an extension could allow interested
            programs to avoid that. Right now I don't believe there are any
            Twisted people actively giving feedback on this, which is too bad.
            <br />

            <br />
            Features (or lack of): as the PEP says, this isn't meant to be a
            replacement framework, rather its a foundation upon which you can
            build frameworks (or port frameworks). This doesn't preclude
            featureful frameworks built on top of WSGI in any way. Most of the
            features you note from mod_python could be implemented just as
            easily on top of WSGI. There are some features that wouldn't be
            supported -- like mod_python's ability to put hooks into different
            places of the request, do a local redirect or recursive redirect,
            etc. But even in these cases, mod_python could provide extensions to
            provide these features as well, the spec specifically allows for
            these kind of extensions.
            <br />

            <br />
            The value added with WSGI is not that suddenly you will have great
            new features. Instead, it's a foundation so that when developers add
            new features, they can share them outside of their personal
            framework. Or, when there are new server targets, those too can be
            used with other frameworks. I think this can lead to a more organic
            development of standards -- when people are able to choose features
            and implementations in a more granular manner, they can be more
            discriminating. This way we can slowly get past diversity, as people
            choose the best solutions for particular aspects of the system.

            Web Frameworks/Servers differ by features and performance.
            <br />

            <br />
            But there's a common ground to all, in that they accept requests and
            deliver content. Nowadays most frameworks also feature
            cookie-handling, authentication and session-persistence.
            <br />

            <br />
            I see web-applications explicitly adressed in this PEP, and
            therefore I also see this rather as a unified interface on top of
            which I can write web-applications, then as a way I can deal with
            web-servers as a framework writer.
