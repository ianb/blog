                A while ago I wrote
                <a class="reference" href="http://pythonpaste.org/wphp/"
                    >WPHP</a
                >
                (or perhaps more accurately I put it together from other
                people's pieces) for embedding a PHP app in Python with a WSGI
                facade. The ultimate goal of that was actually to run
                specifically Wordpress under Python. So I spent some time last
                night doing that, and created
                <a
                    class="reference"
                    href="http://svn.pythonpaste.org/Paste/apps/PyWordpress/trunk"
                    >PyWordpress</a
                >. It seems to work. It's really very small, since WPHP does
                almost all the work. (I might implement the
                <a
                    class="reference"
                    href="http://svn.pythonpaste.org/Paste/Script/trunk/paste/script/appinstall.py"
                    >Paste appinstall</a
                >
                deployment setup which would expand its scope, but I'm not
                sure.)
            </p>
            <p>
                It does open up some development questions. The biggest one is
                that this requires modifications to the Wordpress source. Right
                now you just need the source plus a fixed
                <a
                    class="reference"
                    href="http://svn.pythonpaste.org/Paste/apps/PyWordpress/trunk/pywordpress/wp-config.php"
                    >wp-config.php</a
                >. But if the appinstall stuff is implemented a new
                <tt class="docutils literal"
                    ><span class="pre">wp-admin/install.php</span></tt
                >
                will required. Ultimately we want to embed Wordpress in Zope
                with
                <a
                    class="reference"
                    href="https://svn.openplans.org/svn/topp.zwsgi/trunk"
                    >topp.zwsgi</a
                >, which means that authentication will come from Zope, so the
                authentication routines probably will have to change to respect
                <tt class="docutils literal"
                    ><span class="pre">REMOTE_USER</span></tt
                >. Any number of other things may be added. I doubt these would
                be reasonable upstream changes, though maybe so (you could
                implement similar things with appropriate Apache configuration).
            </p>
            <p>
                So, I have to figure out how to manage a minor fork of the
                Wordpress code, while also tracking upstream updates. So it
                looks like I have a real use for
                <a class="reference" href="dvcs-mini-roundup.html"
                    >Distributed Version Control</a
                >. I guess there's really just two options I'd consider:
                <a class="reference" href="http://bazaar-vcs.org/">bzr</a> (or
                maybe
                <a class="reference" href="http://www.selenic.com/mercurial/"
                    >Mercurial</a
                >
                -- it's hard for me to really distinguish them) or
                <a class="reference" href="http://svk.elixus.org/">svk</a> --
                svk seems unremarkable except for its relation to Subversion,
                but I want to track a Subversion repository, so maybe it's
                perfect, I dunno.

                    FYI, bzr currently has some support for tracking subversion

                    You can just use SVN, why not? It's a matter of a simple
                    script to checkout the parent repo (main WP), and merge the
                    changes into your own branch.

                        It doesn't seem that simple -- I'd have to track ongoing
                        diffs to the main WP and apply those diffs to my local
                        repository, with some failure mechanism when there was a
                        conflict (where a conflict is any unappliable diff).
                        Doable, but I'd rather not work out the details myself.
                        Though I suppose there's probably scripts out there to
                        do this already.

REMOTE_USER authentication can be achieved via a WordPress plugin:

http://dev.wp-plugins.org/browser/http-authentication/trunk/

It uses the WordPress user database, though, meaning you still create users in WordPress.  If this is unacceptable for integration with Zope, I suggest looking at the &quot;pluggable&quot; functions:

http://codex.wordpress.org/Pluggable_Functions

Less editing of upstream source.  :)

                        It's quite possible that there won't be much
                        modification needed.

                        in particular has to be added, because a number of files
                        reference that filename in particular. However, extra
                        plugins don't have to be in the Wordpress tree in
                        particular. I haven't looked at how they are activated
                        (maybe in

                        itself?), but hopefully that process would be flexible
                        enough for what we need. The
                        <tt class="docutils literal"

                            ><span class="pre">auth_redirect</span></tt
                        >
                        functions are mostly what we'd want to override, and
                        they are both pluggable.

                        automated installs.

                    I've been watching Bazaar closely of late, and they're
                    putting consistent and fruitful effort into allowing people
                    to use bzr in multiple modes of operation. I won't rattle
                    off a list of features, because the important thing is to
                    see if it works the way <em>you</em> want. But I do think
                    bzr is the one that is most likely to fit someone's way of
                    working, <em>and</em> let you work consistently with others,
                    simply because the developers are taking ideas from many of
                    the others and making it work seamlessly in bzr.

                    I'd just toss in my support for mercurial as well, I use it
                    pretty extensively and use tailor to export it to svn and
                    pull things in from svn and a whole variety of fancy things
                    to keep multiple libraries in sync automatically. Working at
                    Flock I used mercurial as it was orders of magnitude faster
                    than svn on that gigantic tree, and had tailor pulling in
                    changes to an hg server which I would then pull from and
                    likewise sending my merges back upstream.
