                Apparently they aren't willing to hack the language interpreter
                a little to improve their testing? py.test does some cleverness
                to reinterpret assert statements and capture subexpressions, and
                in the process solves the problem that a whole series of
                assertEqual/etc methods are created to solve. Doctest solves it
                in a slightly different way, by basically turning everything
                into assertEqual (though the fact that is less general can be a
                problem).
            </p>
            <p>
                RSpec is doing something else besides this, I think. The
                tutorial isn't completely up-to-date, so now you can actually do
                <tt class="docutils literal"
                    ><span class="pre">x.should.be.foo</span></tt
                >
                which I think is entirely equivalent to
                <tt class="docutils literal"
                    ><span class="pre">assert</span>
                    <span class="pre">x.foo?</span></tt
                >. Since these transformations are generally pretty easy and
                obvious (and they are <em>supposed</em> to be easy and obvious),
                I'm not sure what the advantage of the RSpec style is. Maybe if
                I saw his presentation.

                I do think it is or can be correct that &quot;Behavior Driven
                Programming&quot; is different than just &quot;Test Driven&quot;
                or unit testing. There really is something different to starting
                with doctest than with starting with unittest or py.test. It's
                closer to acceptance testing; acceptance testing of the API, I
                guess. Unit testing tends to be more focused on testing the
                internals. By emphasizing a story, doctest is encouraging you to
                talk about what things look like from the outside. I expect that
                the style RSpec is implementing is intended to do the same. But
                creating a DSL for that seems like exactly the
                <em>wrong</em> thing, because you aren't describing something
                that anyone can use. When talking about an API, you should be
                using the API, nothing more.

                    Ahh, true - I tend to write my tests as &quot;this is how
                    the API should work&quot;, so maybe I'm just an early
                    adopter of &quot;Behavior Driven Testing&quot;? :) Although,
                    I thought I was just doing good Test Driven Development...
                    but my point is, TDD freaks people out almost as much as
                    Pair Programming, so if someone wants to try a new name, I'm
                    ok with that.

                    After watching the Google TechTalk video (
                    <a
                        class="reference"
                        href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=8135690990081075324&amp;pl=true"

                    >
                    ) on this I think something like this would be a nice thing
                    in Python. Sure it's really just TDD, but it's changing the
                    semantics to encourage good TDD practices instead of just a
                    verification mechanism.
