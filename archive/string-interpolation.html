            <p>
                I was using
                <a
                    class="reference"
                    href="http://python.org/doc/current/lib/node108.html"
                    >string.Template</a
                >
                in
                <a class="reference" href="http://wsgikit.org">WSGIKit</a>
                recently, and I started hacking silly things onto it with a
                dictionary that, for instance, turned
                <tt class="docutils literal"
                    ><span class="pre">d['str_v']</span></tt
                >
                into
                <tt class="docutils literal"
                    ><span class="pre">repr(d['v'])</span></tt
                >. But it got me to thinking about simple templates and string
                substitution, and the next thing you know I implemented
                something to do richer interpolation:
            </p>
            <pre class="literal-block">
&gt;&gt;&gt; name = 'Bob'
&gt;&gt;&gt; e('Hi $name')
'Hi Bob'
&gt;&gt;&gt; e('Hi ${name.lower()}')
'Hi bob'
&gt;&gt;&gt; e('Your name is spelled: ${&quot; &quot;.join(list(name.upper()))}')
'Your name is spelled: B O B'
</pre
            >
            <p>
                Maybe I should just use
                <a class="reference" href="http://cheetahtemplate.org"
                    >Cheetah</a
                >
                and be done with it, but it was interesting to experiment. The
                <a
                    class="reference"
                    href="http://svn.colorstudy.com/home/ianb/recipes/sub_expr.py"
                    >source to e</a
                >
                is, I think, relatively straight-forward. This has been done
                before in the guise of
                <a
                    class="reference"
                    href="http://www.python.org/peps/pep-0215.html"
                    >PEP 215</a
                >. If I was to use this for real, I'd probably allow you to pass
                in a namespace as well -- it still adds value over plain
                <tt class="docutils literal"
                    ><span class="pre">Template</span></tt
                >
                by allowing expressions.

                    Apparently you have to be extra careful about not keeping

                    This reminds me of all of the new text editors that show up
                    on freshmeat as being &quot;smaller than vi&quot; or
                    &quot;less bloated than emacs&quot;... and then the authors
                    drop those once they start growing in size and realize that
                    they actually want some of those things in vi and emacs.

def evalstr(s, dollar=&quot;$&quot;):

    &quot;&quot;&quot;Evaluate a string with embedded python expressions.

    This is a Python version of the function evalstr, which is used for
    variable interpolation.

    For instance,

        a = 5
        evalStr(&quot;I have $a$ dogs.&quot;)

    will return

        &quot;I have 5 dogs.&quot;

    The code between the $'s can be any valid Python expression.  I'll
    just basically do

        str(eval(expression), yourGlobals, yourLocals)

    Since eval is being used, the expression must return some value.
    To escape $'s in s, just use $$ (even within expressions).  To use
    a different character than $, pass the desired character in the
    second (optional) argument.  If there are an odd number of $
    symbols, a ValueError exception will be raised.  Here are some
    additional examples (assuming a = 5):

    &quot;My dog is $a$ years old.&quot; -&gt; &quot;My dog is 5 years old.&quot;,
    &quot;I have $$5.00&quot; -&gt; &quot;I have $5.00&quot;,
    &quot;My $a$ year old dog has $$5.00&quot; -&gt; &quot;My 5 year old dog has $5.00&quot;,
    &quot;My dog has $'$$%s.' % a$&quot; -&gt; &quot;My dog has $5.&quot;,
    &quot;My dog has $'$$' + str(a) + '.'&quot; -&gt; ValueError exception,
    &quot;My dog is $a$.$&quot; -&gt; ValueError exception,
    &quot;$$ is a char.&quot; -&gt; &quot;$ is a char.&quot;,
    &quot;$a$ is a number.&quot; -&gt; &quot;5 is a number.&quot;,
    &quot;$a$&quot; -&gt; &quot;5&quot;,
    &quot;$a&quot; -&gt; ValueError exception,
    &quot;I have a $$&quot; -&gt; &quot;I have a $&quot;,
    &quot;&quot; -&gt; &quot;&quot;,
    &quot;Spam&quot; -&gt; &quot;Spam&quot;,
    &quot;$&quot; -&gt; ValueError exception,
    &quot;$ evalstr('I am #a#.', '#') $&quot; -&gt; &quot;I am 5.&quot;
