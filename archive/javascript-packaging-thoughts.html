</div><h1>Javascript packaging thoughts</h1>
 
<div class="document">
<p>Looking at <a class="reference" href="http://ajaxian.com/downloads/presentations/eich-ajax-experience-2006/">some slides on JS 2</a>,
I think it mostly looks pretty good -- the type stuff seems complex,
but at least not terribly intrusive.  There's one thing I don't like:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
package org.mozilla.venkman {
  class Debugger { . . . }
  class Inspector { . . . }
  class StackWalker { . . . }
}
</pre>
<p>I think package names as a whole just don't make sense; when I do <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">x</span>
<span class="pre">=</span> <span class="pre">1</span></tt> then <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">1</span></tt> doesn't know it is named <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">x</span></tt>, the same should apply
to packages.  Package names bother me in Python, but even more in this
explicit form (with a <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">package</span></tt> declaration).</p>
<p><em>Like</em> Python, all scripts should be modules (in Python terminology),
automatically.  That is, you don't choose whether or not you are
creating a module, you just are, always.</p>
<p><em>Unlike</em> Python, packages shouldn't get names.  Dealing with locating
packages, resolving conflicts or dependencies, etc., is just tedious
and unnecessary.  Instead, use something like:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
venkman = import('venkman.js')
</pre>
<p>This loads the given script by URI (relative to the script itself) as
a module, and returns that module.  Mostly this is just dead simple
and obvious, and naturally safe.  Maybe it should be syntax, as
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">import</span> <span class="pre">*</span></tt> is still a reasonable operation, especially for backward
compatibility.  Or maybe syntax like <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">var</span> <span class="pre">*</span> <span class="pre">=</span> <span class="pre">import('venkman.js')</span></tt> to
unpack an object (in this case a module) into the local namespace.</p>
<p><em>Like</em> in Python, all modules should know where they are located,
similar to <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">__file__</span></tt>.  Maybe a <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">__uri__</span></tt> variable.  All relative imports are relative to this location.  This
way you can do simple factoring without worrying about &quot;name&quot;, just
relative structure of your package.  <em>Unlike</em> in Python, there's no
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">__name__</span></tt>.</p>
<p>There still needs to be a way to include external libraries (which
wouldn't necessarily be accessible through relative paths).  This is a
similar distinction of C's <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">#include</span> <span class="pre">&quot;foo.c&quot;</span></tt> and <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">#include</span>
<span class="pre">&lt;foo.c&gt;</span></tt>.  Maybe <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">import('venkman.js',</span> <span class="pre">'venkman.mozilla.org')</span></tt>,
where the second argument is the name of the framework or package
(<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">venkman.js</span></tt> is the name of the module).  I suppose
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">org.mozilla.venkman</span></tt> looks nice as a package name to people who
program Java; but <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">venkman.mozilla.org</span></tt> looks nice to people who
surf the web.</p>
<p>This second form of importing requires some way to find the libraries
(which is just as true for explicitly declared packages, or maybe even
worse).  I imagine some routine like <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">loadPackage(filename,</span>
<span class="pre">packageName)</span></tt>.  This could return a package or <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">null</span></tt> -- if
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">null</span></tt> then the next loader would be tried.  So, an example:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
registerLoader(function (filename, packageName) {
    try {
        return import('/js-lib/' + packageName + '/' + filename);
    } catch (e if e isinstance ImportError) {
        return null;
    }
});
</pre>
<p>This would give a global search path of <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">/js-lib/</span></tt>.  Some of these
kinds of loaders should be easy to create (implemented as standard functions), perhaps
declaratively through a <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">&lt;link&gt;</span></tt>, since way to find scripts is
intrinsic to the <em>site</em>, not the <em>script</em>.  Whether loading the same
script/URI twice produces the same module, I'm not sure -- probably.
Some languages distinguish between the two (e.g., <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">require</span></tt>
vs. <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">include</span></tt> in PHP).</p>
<p>Packages could install local loaders.  So you could package your
library with all its dependencies, and register a loader for that,
coming after all the other loaders.</p>
<p>Maybe in addition to importing by package, version should also be
allowed.  So, <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">import(filename[,</span> <span class="pre">packageName[,</span> <span class="pre">version]])</span></tt>.  Though
it would have to be a version specification, like <cite>&gt;=1.0,&lt;2.0`</cite>, not
just a single version... and that's relatively hard to do, since
there's no generic way in plain HTTP to list the contents of a
directory and do a search.  I'd be inclined to leave that out, maybe
allowing for:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
venkman = import('venkman.js', 'venkman.mozilla.org');
if (venkman.__version__ &lt; '1.0' || venkman.__version__ &gt;= '2.0') {
    venkman = import('./packages/venkman-1.0/venkman.js');
}
</pre>
<p>Or some externally-provided search path, e.g.:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
{
    // fancyDebugger is picky about the version of venkman it uses...
    let loader = registerLoader(
        pathImporter('./packages/venkman-1.0'));
    fancyDebugger = import('fancyDebugger.js');
    deregisterLoader(loader);
}
</pre>
<p>Which reminds me that JS2 should include encapsulated initialization/finalization.  This would be
another kind of anti-lesson from Python -- we've taken too long to add
this (<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">with</span></tt> in Python 2.5), and Javascript shouldn't put it off.
It's easier to build Javascript function inline and pass them around,
but it's still not used a great deal, in part because it requires a
functional style that is unfamiliar to most programmers.  Maybe it
should learn from Ruby's block arguments, though I'm not sure if the
specifics translate well.  Maybe:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
withLoader(pathImporter('./packages/venkman-1.0'), {{
    fancyDebugger = import('fancyDebugger.js');
}})
</pre>
<p>That specific syntax doesn't really appeal to me, but there must be
something like it that could work.  The way JS2 uses <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">let</span></tt> feels
similar, but doesn't actually work in the same way.</p>
