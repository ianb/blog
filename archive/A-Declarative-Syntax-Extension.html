                <tt class="docutils literal"

                >
                and whatnot. This is the syntax Guido proposes:
            </p>
            <pre class="literal-block">
interface I1(I2, I3):
    &quot;docstring&quot;

    # declare a method, with argument and result types and input validation code
    def method1(arg1: type1, arg2: type2) -&gt; resulttype:
        &quot;docstring&quot;
        ...statements to validate input values...
</pre
            >
            <p>
                I'll ignore the type declarations. He actually extends
                interfaces to support contracts (as the body of the interface
                methods), which is a cool idea. There's a question about how to
                validate the return type, off the top of my head:
            </p>
            <pre class="literal-block">
interface IFile:
    def read(length=None):
        assert length is None or isinstance(length, int)
        v = return
        assert isinstance(v, str)
</pre
            >
            <p>
                But that's an aside. What interests me is the
                <tt class="docutils literal"
                    ><span class="pre">interface</span></tt
                >. Interfaces aren't the only place where
                <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">class</span></tt>
                is currently being abused. Consider this metaclass, for
                instance:
            </p>
            <pre class="literal-block">
class propmeta(type):
    def __new__(meta, className, d, bases):
        if bases == (object,):
            return type(meta, className, d, bases)
        value = property(d.get('get'), d.get('set'), d.get('del'),
                         d.get('__doc__'))
        return value
class prop(object):
    __metaclass__ = propmeta

class Foo(object):
    class dynattr(prop):
        def get(self):
            if not hasattr(self, '_dynattr'):
                self._dynattr = self.calculate_dynattr()
            return self._dynattr
        def set(self, value):
            self.set_dynattr(value)
</pre
            >
            <p>
                <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">prop</span></tt>
                is a cute little class, a bit of syntactic sugar that isn't
                strictly &quot;syntax&quot;; of course, it's not really a class,
                it's a class statement abused into returning a
                <tt class="docutils literal"
                    ><span class="pre">property</span></tt
                >
                descriptor. There's several other places where people are doing
                this (now), and several more that would be possible. So, how
                might this be generalized?
            </p>
            <p>
                This is where something that feels a little like a macro comes
                into play. Imagine when you see a statement like:
            </p>
            <pre class="literal-block">
interface I1(I2):
    def blah(...): ...
</pre
            >
            <p>
                <tt class="docutils literal"
                    ><span class="pre">interface</span></tt
                >
                is an actual object. A method of
                <tt class="docutils literal"
                    ><span class="pre">interface</span></tt
                >
                is called with the name (<tt class="docutils literal"
                    ><span class="pre">&quot;I1&quot;</span></tt
                >), the arguments (<tt class="docutils literal"
                    ><span class="pre">(I2,)</span></tt
                >), and a dictionary of defined attributes in the body (<tt
                    class="docutils literal"
                    ><span class="pre">blah</span></tt
                >). And maybe a list of strings indicating what order, because
                that would be nice to know. This is very much like metaclasses,
                but without the keyword
                <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">class</span></tt
                >.
            </p>
            <p>
                Anyway, it's then up to
                <tt class="docutils literal"
                    ><span class="pre">interface</span></tt
                >
                to do what it wants. In this case it creates an interface
                object.
                <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">class</span></tt>
                creates class objects,
                <tt class="docutils literal"
                    ><span class="pre">property</span></tt
                >
                creates properties,
                <tt class="docutils literal"
                    ><span class="pre">contact</span></tt
                >
                creates methods or functions with pre- and post-conditions, and
                so on. (Do these all always take a name -- class name, function
                name, property name -- and always add that name to their
                scope?).
            </p>
            <p>
                Here's an example with contracts; it's not <em>great</em>, but
                it's not too bad:
            </p>
            <pre class="literal-block">
contract gcd:
    def pre(a, b):
        assert isinstance(a, (int, long)) and a &gt; 0
        assert isinstance(b, (int, long)) and b &gt; 0
    def gcd(a, b):
        ...
    def post((a, b), value):
        assert isinstance(value, int) and value &gt; 0
        assert not a % value and not b % value
</pre
            >
            <p>
                You aren't transforming source, you don't even have lazy
                expressions. The mechanics are relatively simple to imagine. You
                won't confuse accidentally-adjacent expressions for a
                declaration, as the line has to end with
                <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">:</span></tt
                >. E.g., these will still be a parse error:
            </p>
            <pre class="literal-block">
call_func(arg1 # &lt;-- oops, forgot comma
          arg2)
func 10
</pre
            >
            <p>
                I want to call these new objects declarative keywords, but
                that's exactly what they aren't. I think the declarative objects
                should define some special name. Like
                <tt class="docutils literal"
                    ><span class="pre">__declare__</span></tt
                >
                or something, rather than using
                <tt class="docutils literal"
                    ><span class="pre">__call__</span></tt
                >, which many objects already have, or
                <tt class="docutils literal"
                    ><span class="pre">__new__</span></tt
                >
                which is a method I've always hated (maybe
                <tt class="docutils literal"
                    ><span class="pre">__new__</span></tt
                >... I dunno). If you, say, misspell
                <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">class</span></tt
                >, you should notice quite quickly, as declarations typically
                occur at the global scope, and are executed on import, so errors
                (like misspellings) are quickly detected even though you've lost
                a class of syntax errors.
            </p>
            <p>
                I don't like that you could start passing these objects around,
                e.g., using
                <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">class</span></tt>
                in an expression. Not that I expect people will do that;
                higher-order higher-order syntaxes are clearly not a good idea.
            </p>
            <p>
                I feel like there's a lot of potential uses for this. At first I
                thought these constructors should be passed more abstract code
                objects, and their entire containers would be lazily evaluated
                -- even
                <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">def</span></tt>
                could be implemented in these terms then -- but that just seemed
                too complicated and prone to complexity. But then things like
                <tt class="docutils literal"
                    ><span class="pre">contract</span></tt
                >
                could be much slicker with that ability.
