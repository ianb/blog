                I'm off for a bit of vacation, but before then I thought I'd
                throw up a bunch of links to stuff I've been doing in the last
                couple months:

                    I've been doing a lot with HTML lately. HTML is great,
                    because it's important. (Hmm... this statement sounds kind
                    of weird. <em>Because</em> HTML is important, if you don't
                    understand why it is great you need to think harder. Now the
                    statement sounds weird, but in a <em>deep</em> way)

                <ul class="simple">
                    <li>
                        I've started working with microformats some. This
                        initially started with an
                        <a
                            class="reference"
                            href="http://wiki.laptop.org/go/Content_stamping"
                            >OLPC project</a
                        >, where I wrote an
                        <a
                            class="reference"
                            href="http://svn.colorstudy.com/home/ianb/hReviewParser/trunk"
                            >hReview parser</a

                            href="http://microformats.org/wiki/hreview"

                    <li>
                        Then related to that, I wanted to download a bunch of
                        pages in an isolated form, so all the internal links are
                        fixed up. This became
                        <a
                            class="reference"
                            href="http://svn.colorstudy.com/home/ianb/PageCollector/trunk"
                            >PageCollector</a
                        >. Since then I've added a script frontend. I think this
                        could be a generally handy export system. It doesn't
                        just make links relative, it also lets you completely
                        remap filenames and is fairly careful about links
                        (including links in CSS).

                    <li>
                        Doing all this HTML-related stuff, I've been using
                        <a class="reference" href="http://codespeak.net/lxml/"
                            >lxml</a
                        >
                        a lot (and it should be inferred I therefor also like
                        <a class="reference" href="http://xmlsoft.org/"
                            >libxml2</a
                        >
                        a lot). I like lxml a lot; probably the biggest reason
                        is that it has a fast permissive HTML parser. But the
                        ElementTree API that lxml uses can be a bit awkward for
                        HTML -- it works well for XML, but in HTML there's lots
                        of mixing of text and tags, and that feels really weird
                        in the ElementTree API. So I've started
                        <a
                            class="reference"
                            href="http://codespeak.net/svn/lxml/branch/html"
                            >lxml.html</a
                        >
                        in a branch with lots of feedback from Stefan Behnel.
                        This adds methods that are useful in HTML. With just a
                        few smallish methods, I think it makes HTML much easier
                        to work with in lxml.

                        is nice, it's not a C-based HTML parser. With

                        we are literally parsing and rewriting every page as it
                        comes through our site. I couldn't do this with
                        BeautifulSoup. And we're not doing any crappy regex
                        stuff; lxml lets us actually understand the HTML the way
                        the browser understands the HTML. That's important. This
                        is kind of the promise of XHTML -- the ability to create
                        smart and useful intermediaries -- that XHTML never
                        really fulfilled. The idea of smart intermediaries is a
                        powerful one, XHTML just wasn't the right basis;
                        <em>intermediaries</em> are supposed to work with
                        <em>real</em> endpoints, and those endpoints were and
                        continue to be HTML, not XHTML.
                        <a

                        is cool too as an HTML parser, and important as a
                        reference implementation, but I'll mostly be waiting for
                        that work to filter back into something like libxml2.

                    <li>
                        I should note that I think the stream model of handling
                        HTML (as
                        <a
                            class="reference"
                            href="http://python.org/doc/current/lib/module-HTMLParser.html"
                            >HTMLParser</a
                        >
                        uses) is lame. Typical HTML is not very big, and a
                        document model (where the whole document is loaded into
                        memory) is way easier to handle. HTML is best understood
                        as a document. (<a

                        would probably be rockin' fast if it used lxml)

                    <li>
                        As part of lxml.html I've been writing an
                        <a
                            class="reference"
                            href="http://codespeak.net/svn/lxml/branch/html/src/lxml/html/clean.py"

                        be really useful. Because we fully parse and then
                        serialize the HTML, a lot of XSS attacks are avoided
                        really early. At work David Turner has been working on a
                        <a
                            class="reference"

                        I took the pattern from
                        <tt class="docutils literal"
                            ><span class="pre"

                        and also ported it to lxml. Now you can do
                        <em>semantic</em> HTML and XML diffs in your doctests,
                        instead of literal string comparison. This means that
                        things like the order of your attributes are ignored, as
                        is whitespace. And the diffs help highlight problems in
                        a more fine-grained way. Using the html branch you can
                        do
                        <tt class="docutils literal"
                            ><span class="pre">from</span>

                        to enable the comparison inside a doctest. And you don't
                        need a custom doctest runner. I managed to do this using
                        horrible horrible monkeypatching. Also from FormEncode

                        textual differences while trying to avoid markup
                        differences (since it's really hard to visually
                        represent changes in markup, and also usually not what
                        people care about). This is surprisingly difficult
                        because you also need to <em>preserve</em> the markup --
                        you can't just smash all the words together. I think
                        it's a pretty good implementation, and there aren't that
                        many implementations of this out there. You can also do
                        blame style annotations, showing who added what over the
                        history of the page.

                        <em>used</em> its functionality much yet. But it's
                        awesome functionality once we get around to using it.

                        Related to that deployment, I spent some time with

                        thread pool to add threads when necessary, kill threads
                        that seem to be wedged, and various tools around that.

                        was handy, as now I can kill threads. It's surprisingly
                        slow, though -- it frequently takes several minutes for
                        the thread to be killed. But it shows up as a regular
                        exception, which is great. You can read about the

                        for your non-browser-based proxying. This is mostly for
                        handling HTTP-based dispatch between server
                        applications.

                        using Paste and WSGI middleware. It kind of works. It
                        was just a prototype, so I haven't worked on it more,
                        but with just a <em>little</em> more work I think it
                        should be easy to turn any WSGI middleware into an HTTP
                        proxy. This is the kind of proxy you configure in your
                        browser.

                        important ways it feels like the best UI among the
                        bunch. It's just more polished and higher quality than
                        the other options. It's also a Real Open Source Project,
                        which matters to us. But we haven't actually implemented

                        This didn't occur to me at first -- I was going to
                        create a Python representation of the Atom data model
                        and then add parse and serialize methods to it. This is
                        wrong, because the Atom data model <em>is</em> XML. If
                        you add a funky custom element to your entry and I
                        normalize it into oblivion, then I've made a crappy
                        library; by making the XML the one and only source of
                        information I avoid such things.

                        I've decided realistic examples are essential to good

                        for the little internal templating things just wasn't
                        good. Cheetah has been too hard to install. So this is a
                        simple, single-file templating language based on string
                        substitution. I should probably extract it and do a few
                        more things with it. I feel a little dumb about writing
                        Yet Another Templating Language, but I couldn't find a
                        templating language that I liked for small text-related
                        tasks. For actual web programming a more complete
                        language is good.

                    is great, because I spend all my time working on open source

                    in my sig, simply because I think everyone cool should work
                    at TOPP. We're doing other interesting things too that I'm
                    not directly involved with; I'll try to write about other
                    people's projects before too long.

                    After vacation I should probably start looking more into
                    getting WordPress on our site. TOPP is not technically
                    tribalist! We do accept PHP, even if we don't really
                    <em>trust</em> PHP. Once that's up, I'll move my own blog
                    from this crappy piece of spam ridden crap (that I wrote, so
                    no one but myself to blame), and then maybe I'll post more
                    because I'll be less embarrassed about the software.

                    html5lib is cool too as an HTML parser, and important as a
                    reference implementation, but I'll mostly be waiting for
                    that work to filter back into something like libxml2.

                <p>
                    I should stress html5lib is not a reference implementation
                    in the traditional sense of the word; it's the first public
                    implementation of the HTML 5 spec and has a pretty valuable
                    set of tests but it has no other status at all; any
                    disagreements with the spec are bugs in html5lib. In
                    particular testing implementations against html5lib output
                    is not recommended.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There is also some work going on on making a fast
                    implementation of the HTML5 spec parsing algorithm in C; I
                    will be first in line to make Python bindings when that work
                    is complete (and no doubt others will come up with other
                    bindings too).
