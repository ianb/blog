</div><h1>Kernel, meet Python</h1>
 <p>

I just started reading about <a href="http://www.freenet.org.nz/python/lufs-python/">LUFS-Python</a>
via <a href="http://www.larsen-b.com/archives/000064.html">Jkx@Home</a>, and
now in another entry by <a href="http://simon.incutio.com/archive/2003/12/10/pythonFilesystems">Simon
Willison</a>.

<p>

<a href="http://lufs.sf.net">LUFS</a> is Linux Usermode File System; a
virtual file system implemented by a normal process (as opposed to
being compiled into the kernel).  It's a neat idea, and one which
should have come about a long time ago.  This kind of feature was one
of the selling points of <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/hurd/hurd.html">GNU Hurd</a> (but
that shouldn't scare you away from it ;).

<p>

Simon comes up with a couple ideas I hadn't thought of -- it wouldn't
have occurred to me to use LUFS to underly other protocols, like FTP
or SMB, or even DAV.  But once you have files, these servers already
exist.

<p>

I'd definitely like to experiment with this, but at the same time
there were significant problems the last time I used LUFS.  At the
time I was looking for a WebDAV filesystem for Linux, and I didn't
want to install Code and a bunch of other things that <a href="http://dav.sourceforge.net/">davfs2</a> required (though I may
yet try that again).  LUFS also seemed like the Right Way.  Now the
DAV option seems to have disappeared, or maybe I was imagining it and
I was only using sshfs; either way, I did manage to get it working.
Besides having bugs (which happens), the things was <i>really</i>
slow.  Not just network-filesystem slow, but I-can't-use-this slow.
My perception was that things that seemed trivial to me (like tab
completion) resulted in expensive calls.  The performance
characteristics of these filesystems just didn't map to my
expectation, or the expectation of the tools I use.  I doubt grep or
find would be a very effective.  If you take a different track,
something like <a href="http://savannah.gnu.org/projects/tramp/">Tramp</a> for Emacs
(which I find absolutely indispensable) works at a higher
(application) level, and has the opportunity to use that to its
advantage [ouch, Savannah is down, but you can read some <a href="http://www.xemacs.org/Documentation/packages/html/tramp.html#SEC_Top">here</a>
for now].  This is also the advantage of similar systems like KDE's <a href="http://developer.kde.org/documentation/design/kde/ioslaves/framework.html">ioslaves</a>,
and <a href="http://developer.gnome.org/doc/API/gnome-vfs/">Gnome
VFS</a>.

<p>

Some of this can probably be cleverly fixed, through judicious use of
caching and prediction.  This is why Python could make this a lot more
interesting, because Python is such an accessible language that you
can build all these features without going mad.  For most of these
filesystems, the bottlenecks (I predict) are at a level where Python
is Fast Enough, and a well optimized Python program could beat a
poorly optimized C program.

<p>

The other big issue I see is that filesystem semantics aren't correct
for some of these virtual filesystems.  We see this in Windows Web
Folders, where applications require special modification (even if
minor) to use these files correctly.  Ioslaves and VFS try to do the
same thing.  But if you work in an entirely application-neutral
manner, like LUFS, how do you deal with varying semantics?  These are
things like WebDAV locking or versioning, or RDBMS transactions, and
it continues for almost all things that seem at first blush to be
filesystem-like.

<p>

I have too much stuff to work on, but this still has me quite
excited, I'll definitely have to play with it.
