                We're leaving tomorrow for Mexico! We're going to Oaxaca, and
                then on the latter part of the trip making our way to Mexico
                City where we fly out.
            </p>
            <p>
                Lots of stuff going on lately, I've been feeling overwhelmed but
                also excited. So it feels hard to just leave. OTOH, it seems
                really great to leave. I look forward to the break.
            </p>
            <p>
                Despite living in a city surrounded by Spanish writing and
                Spanish speakers, I have sadly not practiced my Spanish for
                years. However, while my grammar has decayed and my vocabulary
                is poor, I'm hoping an ability to string together large numbers
                of simple words to make statements that allude to my true
                meaning will work out. It's like charades with words. I need to
                ask for a decongestant? Necesito medecino para me nariz, porque
                esta lleno de agua! I hope such attempts will amuse if not
                inform.
            </p>
            <p>I'll be back on the 21st. Ta-ta!</p>
