                    class="reference"
                    href="https://ianbicking.org/docs/pycon2005/lightning/metaclasses.html"

                presentation first and it didn't come back around to me again,
                which is too bad -- I actually didn't care about the other
                presentation that much.
            </p>
            <p>My premise:</p>
            <blockquote>
                Resolving Python's problems with web programming is
                <strong>the</strong> most important thing we can do to market
                Python.
            </blockquote>
            <p>
                You might dismiss me as being self-centered, as I'm a Python web
                programmer, and we all think our own problems are the most
                important problems. But then I'm a web programmer because I
                think it's the most important and empowering development
                environment of our time -- it has been for at least the last
                five years, and I'd be surprised if that didn't stay true for at
                least the next five years.
            </p>
            <p>
                And <em>I</em> am doing okay -- these aren't my own problems I'm
                complaining about. I don't want to talk down Python web
                programming too much -- if you are serious about web programming
                the initial investment <em>will</em> pay off, since Python is a
                great environment. But if you aren't committed enough to invest
                that time, and you want to produce something useful quickly,
                then -- though it hurts me to say this -- Python isn't a good
                choice.
            </p>
            <p>
                This is an incredible missed opportunity for Python. Most other
                marketing efforts underway for Python are (IMHO, of course)
                misplaced.
            </p>
            <p>
                Right now Python marketing -- which is admittedly an
                afterthought for everyone -- is driven by a desire to compete
                with Java (and probably .NET recently). But people won't admit
                that we are utterly incapable of competing head-to-head with
                these languages, because they speak to an audience we can't
                market to directly.
            </p>
            <p>
                Everything that makes Python great doesn't mean much to managers
                -- will they care about significant whitespace? Sometimes it's
                even contrary to what managers want. Managers are wary of
                empowering programmers, because it scares them to become
                dependent on a single programmer --
                <a class="reference" href="respecting-the-programmer.html"
                    >I think this isn't a big problem for Python</a
                >, but it is something that encourages heavyweight methodologies
                (which aren't good in Python), B&amp;D programming environments,
                static typing, etc.
            </p>
            <p>
                Python appeals to programmers. That's who we have to sell
                ourselves to. Forget everyone else. Let the programmers sell it
                to their own managers -- if they really love Python, they'll go
                through that effort. If they are really successful with Python
                it won't be hard for them -- Python will sell itself. If Python
                can't sell itself then it doesn't deserve to be adopted --
                ultimately what matters is what people build in Python, not the
                virtues of the language itself.
            </p>
            <p>
                What we need to do is get our foot in the door. We need to get
                programmers to write projects and do so successfully. We need
                those projects to be visible to managers.
            </p>
            <p>
                Web programming is the best way to get our foot in the door. A
                programmer with little experience can produce a useful web
                application in a matter of hours. Not just playful or
                interesting, but something that can actually go into productive
                and live use. The only other environment where that is possible
                is the command line -- and managers never see programmers'
                command line tools.
            </p>
            <p>
                Web programming is also a kind of universal need. Sure, there's
                lots of things besides the web. But unless you really try to
                avoid the web, as a programmer you are likely to have occasional
                problems that are best solved with a web application. This is
                true no matter what field you are in. In part because web
                applications don't just touch on core needs -- e.g., embedded
                programming at a hardware company, numerical analysis at an
                engineering firm -- but on any coordination needs, and everyone
                needs to coordinate things. The embedded
            </p>
            <p>
                programmer might display test results in a web page, the
                engineer may collect data via a web upload form. If they have
                successful experiences in Python in these cases, it is only
                natural that they will try to use Python elsewhere. That's
                great, because Python is appropriate in some way for most of
                those other use cases too.
            </p>
            <p>
                When we consider Python marketing, we should look for
                <em>accessible</em> marketing successes. Java isn't accessible.

                aren't J2EE, and I could go on. These aren't just technical
                differences, they are based on deep social differences. We need
                to look at agile and open source successes. (And we have to look
                at <em>successes</em>, so no need to look at Smalltalk or
                Lisp...)

                By some coincidence three languages starting with P are often
                grouped together: Perl, PHP, and Python. It's a nice
                coincidence, and these are the languages I've thought about.
                Both Perl and PHP have had tremendous bursts of growth because
                of web programming. This graph isn't entirely a representation
                of PHP's growth, but it says something, and it's doesn't take a
                graph to know that PHP has grown incredibly rapidly:
            </p>
            <img

            />
            <p>
                And <em>Python could have been PHP</em>. <em>We</em> could have
                seen that kind of growth. But we didn't, because there has been
                and continues to be a bunch of little things that make Python
                annoying to use and get started with for web programming. But
                it's not all over -- PHP 5 is barely catching up to Python's
                features from 10 years ago. There's a lot of room for a better
                language to take it's place. (Though we

                    >should be a little worried</a
                >
                that Ruby could be that language.)
            </p>
            <p>
                Anyone who cares about Python should care about the web
                programming situation -- no matter what your area of expertise.
                Those of us in the web development community need both support
                and pressure to improve things. We also need support from the
                Python core -- there's some longstanding issues with Python that
                cause problems; things like long-running processes and reloading
                code, isolating and monitoring interpreter instances, and
                restricted environments. These are things that reach far down
                into Python the language, in such a way that the application
                programmers that need the features aren't generally able to make
                much progress (nor is it clear they'd get support on any
                solutions they did provide). We also need input from people
                trying to do commodity Python hosting, and we need to pay
                attention to what they say.
            </p>
            <p>
                Really, I want this post to be seen as an optimistic one. We all
                know about the problem, but we should focus on the incredible
                opportunity that's out there if we can solve this. I know we're
                all volunteers -- I am too. We work on what we enjoy. But we
                also do this work because we can always imagine great things yet
                to be created. We do this work because we enjoy sharing our
                ambitions and successes with others. I just hope people will
                direct their imaginations in this direction, because we could
                really use the help.

                    Trying to explain to people how to do Web programming in
                    Python, or even trying to convince them to let me do Web
                    programming in Python (instead of say PHP) has been an
                    embarrassment. (This despite my opinion that PHP is an
                    embarrassment to the term &quot;programming language&quot;.)
                </p>
                <p>
                    I have long believed that Web scripting is the domain with
                    the biggest bang-for-buck you can get out of a high-level
                    language, mainly because the Web is the universal user
                    interface. Once a program is placed on the Web, its
                    functionality becomes instantly accessible to millions of
                    people. Tiny, simple programs can become useful groupware
                    tools. It's all about the barrier to entry.

                <p>
                    Over the course of Python's history, i think Guido hasn't
                    recognized the full significance of this. It's not due to
                    any shortcoming as a language designer; it's just that the
                    Web is not what he does every day. At PyCon i heard him
                    remark something along the lines of, &quot;The Web isn't
                    everything&quot; or &quot;There's a lot more to programming
                    than the Web.&quot; Well, yes and no. There's certainly a
                    lot more ways to use a programming language than just for
                    Web programming. But if you're talking about adoption, the
                    Web <em>is</em> everything, nearly.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Improving standard library modules to support Web
                    programming (such as cgi.py) has been on my to-do list for
                    ages. I bear some of the burden for not acting sooner to
                    improve things in Python, and it weighs heavily on me.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Not all is lost, though. PHP succeeded at displacing Perl as
                    a widespread Web programming language, so maybe it can
                    happen again. Python can still do many things that other
                    languages can't -- for example, cgitb exploits Python's
                    unique strengths to provide a huge win for Web developers.
                    Huge. Using cgitb completely changed how i did CGI
                    development overnight. Even though it was introduced a few
                    years ago, no other language has anything like it. Things
                    like this point to deeper strengths in the language that no
                    amount of hacking can add to PHP.

                        The vitrol that Python programmer's have for PHP has
                        always baffeled me. Frankly, part of the reason I've
                        avoided learning Python is because every Python
                        programmer I've ever met has been a prick about my
                        current choice in programming language. PHP works, I
                        enjoy programming in it, I like the way it feels and
                        reads, and the user community is incredibly supportive.
                        More importantly, I've built some seriously effective
                        web applications using it. If you want me to bother
                        learning Python, loose the 'tude, dude.

                    <p>
                        Seriously, every language has its problems and it's
                        quirks. PHP is far from perfect (e.g. no namespaces),
                        but many of Python's language design features, such as
                        the meaningful whitespace concept, I find unpleasant to
                        work with. (A little too much like FORTRAN for my
                        taste.) That doesn't mean that I don't think its a good
                        language, or that Python programmers are bad people.
                        (Just pooly socialized.) Obviously people have done a
                        lot of great work in Python, and its a very useful tool.
                        But its also a language that has a very different syntax
                        from PHP, PERL, JavaScript, Java - languages that web
                        people are familiar and comfortable with. If you want to
                        get us to part with our semicolons, curly braces, and
                        crazy bohemian whitespace, you're going to have to be
                        nicer to us, and more polite about the tools we love.

                    Finding Python hosting is difficult and all are expensive. I
                    find that a dis-incentive to try it. Even if we leave that
                    factor out, I find the plethora of options out there
                    confusing. I plan to try Nevow sometime in the future.

                        Now this is interesting. I am running hosting besides
                        other things and I'd love to provide Python too. Is
                        there a consensus what that means actually? Is it CGIs
                        in Python, Zope, Webware, Twisted, or mod_python within
                        Apache? Or all of them? Or anything else? Then, there is
                        a question how to set them up when you have decided -
                        what access rights, permissions, etc.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I have a couple of my own projects there and they use
                        mod_python. This includes some hacking in the
                        mod_rewrite, or mod_alias for every project that needs
                        python for it to work. PHP is different: you just drop
                        the files in the directory and it just works.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Maybe when ordinary administrators (= not using Python
                        every day) know how to set it up, there will be plenty
                        of Python hostings; when it is as easy as issuing

                <p>
                    Thanks for writing this post. I think you're right on. I
                    myself am, I suppose, an intermediate programmer -- I had
                    only programmed in Perl and a bit of C++ before finding
                    Python -- but I rapidly became enamored of Python's
                    usability and &quot;discoverability.&quot; Even after a year
                    or so of programming Python, I still get the feeling that by
                    just poking around in the command line, I can figure out
                    what I need to know to get a job done without reading reams
                    of documentation. And in fact I <em>have</em> managed to get
                    things done that way -- my productivity in Python compared
                    to Perl is an order of magnitude of difference.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Except when it comes to the web. I'm currently trying to
                    build my first substantial web application, and I would
                    <em>love</em> to write it in Python. But watching the recent
                    progress in the Rails world has made me wonder if learning
                    Ruby wouldn't actually be faster than building and/or
                    learning the Python frameworks necessary to get my project
                    off the ground. Or even figuring out which frameworks are
                    appropriate! &quot;There's one obvious way to do it&quot;
                    most definitely does not apply in the Python web programming
                    world, and it's too bad.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Even so, I think the Subway project looks promising, and I
                    think that Python has several features that make it better
                    than Ruby for web programming, most important of all, I
                    think, being that Python has the best Unicode support of any
                    of the &quot;P&quot; languages. (A fact which shouldn't be
                    underestimated.)
                </p>
                <p>
                    It seems to me that a concerted effort could be made to
                    unify various existing components into a useable and easily
                    installed MVC package.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The competition with Rails may turn out to be the best thing
                    to have happened for Python web programming... I hope so.
                    Maybe a little &quot;marketing&quot; for such an effort
                    wouldn't be such a bad thing? How do we build momentum?

                    Thru the years every Python web solution I've evaluated
                    makes at least one deadly assumption: scalability and
                    performance don't matter, production uses compatible version
                    control, the HTML/XML is not templatized and is not language
                    neutral, no CGI URL will end in .html, every URL is
                    controlled by Python code, subdirectories are class
                    heirarchies, etc. That is why Python fails on the high end.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Python fails on the low end because PHP makes an effort to
                    get out of the way of newbies. It is easy to get useful
                    results out of inexperienced people without reading a lot,
                    configuring a lot, or annoying administrators.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Solutions like Zope are closer to J2EE than to Ruby On
                    Rails. That is a mistake.
                </p>
                <p>
                    PyGTK is a first choice. Maybe some day something like
                    CherryPy will be too.

                    I'm a PHP/Java/Ruby/Python programmer. I tried once to talk
                    (but it's amazing how some people does not know how to talk)
                    with a influent Python local dude about this. I told him
                    that mod_python will spread more easily if it could show all
                    it's power running on Apache 1.x, since there's is a LOT of
                    websites still running Apache 1.x.
                </p>
                <p>
                    That was worst than insult his mother. He became mad, angry,
                    asked me if we need to use old tools, that is a stupid idea
                    blah blah blah.
                </p>
                <p>
                    He did not see the point there. I was thinking in a way that
                    could help to, for example, THOUSANDS of PHP coders try
                    mod_python (easy), without upgrade their webservers (harder)
                    while PHP still marked Apache 2.x as experimental. But he
                    was not able to talk about that. I told his so beloved tool
                    could not work perfectly (and I was able to help if there
                    was a way, on that moment) on a older enviroment, and he
                    became mad, offended. Stupid. Idiot.
                </p>
                <p>
                    While this kind of behaviour still exists on the Python
                    community (and believe me, there is a lot of situations like
                    this), the tool will not even go closer where PHP is. While
                    PHP is not a half of the language Python is (and I think
                    Python is <em>very</em> better than PHP), some Python dudes
                    are really hard to deal.

                <p>Thanks for writing this, Ian.</p>
                <p>
                    You've clearly articulated a deep frustration that I have
                    felt for several years now. I would love to do web
                    programming in Python but I know that pragmatically PHP is a
                    better choice despite its inadequacies as a language.
                    Finding affordable Python hosting is not easy ; choosing a
                    framework is not easy. Even when frameworks are well
                    documented - like modpython - I would like more than just
                    the bare documentation i.e. books.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For commodity hosting to emerge and books to be written the
                    community has to agree on one framework, develop it further
                    and make it easy for new programmers to get started. I worry
                    that by failing to recognise the importance of the web and
                    adding further complexities to the language Python will
                    actually begin to lose users.

                    This is one of the most important things haunting Python
                    today! Thanks so much for writing this.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Recently, at work, one of my bosses asked me what I would
                    choose to write a potential web application and web service.
                    We develop a lot of Python applications, and its definitely
                    my favorite language. After a lot of thinking, I responded
                    &quot;Rails.&quot; I don't even like Ruby very much, but
                    Rails is obviously the best web framework out there because
                    of the tightly integrated simplicity of it! Rails is the
                    Apple of web frameworks -- one tightly controlled stack.
                    Sure, you may lose some flexibility, but you gain beauty,
                    simplicity, and ease of use! I really really wanted to pick
                    Python, but I just couldn't do it. There are too many
                    frameworks, none of which are as good as Rails.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Python is making the mistake of copying Java when it comes
                    to web frameworks: choice is better. We are going to end of
                    with a myriad of tools that do one thing sorta well (for
                    Java: struts, hibernate, tapestry, et al... for Python:
                    Cheetah, Nevow, Quixote, CherryPy, et al), but when you put
                    them together, you get highly abstracted, loosely coupled,
                    confusing mess. I am especially afraid that we are going
                    this route because of the WSGI. Don't get me wrong, its a
                    great idea, but its not the solution to our problem: its an
                    enabler. &quot;Now you can have more choice&quot; ... thats
                    not appealing. Thats more work. Thats more to figure out. In
                    the Ruby world, if you are developing a web application,
                    there is no choice: there is Rails. And thats okay, since
                    its so damn well done. In the Python world, if a web
                    framework doesn't do something that you want, you just
                    create your own framework... why not fix the original one?
                    The whole situation is embarrassing.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I don't think Java is the right platform to emulate when it
                    comes to web application (ever, really). I think, at least
                    in this one regard, we need to look at the principles behind
                    what makes Ruby on Rails so successful, and come up with
                    something to counter it in Python. Otherwise, I promise you,
                    Rails will be the dominate open source, dynamic web
                    framework for the next few years at least.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Anyway, sorry to rant here, but your post really struck a
                    chord with me!

                        I don't disagree with Ian's diagnosis of the problem
                        (although it's not terribly relevant to me personally),
                        but I will disagree with this particular prescription
                        for it. I can understand being frustrated with the
                        proliferation of web frameworks, but let's face it:
                        there is <em>no way</em> you are going to be able to
                        convince anyone to give up on their pet framework to
                        work on someone else's.

                    <p>
                        I see a lot of people in the Python web community
                        complaining about proliferation of frameworks. I don't
                        see anyone at all standing up and saying &quot;My web
                        framework X is unnecessary, I will abandon it and spend
                        my web-framework development time working on web
                        framework Y instead.&quot;

                    <p>
                        Let's focus on what is going to make web frameworks
                        seamless to use. Personally I think that &quot;web
                        programming&quot; is a red herring and the problems with
                        Python are basic platform deployment issues: for
                        example, the lack of a packaging system makes the
                        simplest task in web programming - downloading and
                        setting up a framework - unnecessarily difficult.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For those of you that are going to heed Ian's call to
                        arms, please consider productive suggestions that people
                        can follow. If we're not each going to give up our
                        individual toolkits, let's at least agree on the
                        featureset that would make each of them really
                        attractive to new people coming to the Python web space.

                            Well, I personally have resisted the urge to develop
                            a new framework (an urge I've felt many times over
                            the years), and I actually am willing to give up my
                            framework of choice for more conformity. But I can't
                            <em>abandon</em> my framework (and I can't expect
                            anyone else to do so either) -- other people have
                            trusted my opinion and choice over the years, and it
                            would be irresponsible of me to abandon them and
                            those applications I've developed. Which is a bind a
                            lot of us have probably been in. That's one of the
                            things I see in WSGI, is a path out -- a way to
                            support the old apps and consolidate and improve the
                            new apps, without being bogged down in abandoned

                        <p>
                            Talking to people at PyCon, I don't think I'm
                            altogether unusual. First, there's a lot of people
                            with homegrown frameworks, and from what I can tell
                            this describes most of them -- they are dissatisfied
                            but trapped by their own legacy. But even beyond
                            that there's hope that open source frameworks can
                            consolidate. If we can phrase one framework in terms
                            of another there's the opportunity for the lesser
                            frameworks to melt away, to create a layered
                            environment instead of competing full-featured
                            stacks (well, they are all actually
                            partially-featured stacks).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            As to Rails: I agree that it's a challenge and a
                            competitor, but it's not a model. People have been
                            working on Rails-like things in Python for a long
                            time, with various successes and failures. But
                            Python's flaw isn't that we don't have any
                            interesting frameworks or interesting MVC systems.
                            Python simply isn't at the same place Ruby is. We
                            have to fix our specific problems, not immitate
                            someone else.

                            <p>Okay, first to respond to Glyph's statements:</p>
                            <p>
                                &quot;&quot;&quot;I don't disagree with Ian's
                                diagnosis of the problem (although it's not
                                terribly relevant to me personally), but I will
                                disagree with this particular prescription for
                                it. I can understand being frustrated with the
                                proliferation of web frameworks, but let's face
                                it: there is no way you are going to be able to
                                convince anyone to give up on their pet
                                framework to work on someone
                                else's.&quot;&quot;&quot;
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I am not saying that anyone has to give up their
                                old software. And Ian's suggestion for the WSGI
                                as a &quot;way out&quot; is a good one. However,
                                I do think its reasonable to centralize around
                                one solution. I am not saying that there can't
                                be other solutions, I am saying that our current
                                solutions suck. If any of our solutions were as
                                good as Rails, they would have a dominant user
                                base in the Python community. I really believe
                                that! I don't even care if we start from an
                                existing base, as long as we get somewhere!
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                &quot;&quot;&quot;I see a lot of people in the
                                Python web community complaining about
                                proliferation of frameworks. I don't see anyone
                                at all standing up and saying &quot;My web
                                framework X is unnecessary, I will abandon it
                                and spend my web-framework development time
                                working on web framework Y
                                instead.&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Well, I don't have a framework that I have
                                written that is out in the world. However, if I
                                did, I would be willing to give it up or allow
                                it to become the new central framework. I think
                                its really selfish to hold onto one's own
                                framework if presented with the option to unify.
                                Let's be honest, there are probably only 3 or 4
                                different Python web frameworks with any
                                traction whatsoever. This adds up to somewhere
                                between 5-10 people (likely) that actually have
                                control of these frameworks. I see no reason why
                                5-10 people can't come together and work as a
                                group to improve the obviously broken situation
                                we are in now. What we currently have is good
                                for noone: especially the Python community.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                &quot;&quot;&quot;Let's focus on what is going
                                to make web frameworks seamless to use.
                                Personally I think that &quot;web
                                programming&quot; is a red herring and the
                                problems with Python are basic platform
                                deployment issues: for example, the lack of a
                                packaging system makes the simplest task in web
                                programming - downloading and setting up a
                                framework - unnecessarily
                                difficult.&quot;&quot;&quot;
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Wow. I really disagree. This might make us
                                slightly more popular, but it certainly wouldn't
                                make us better. You are copying Java. We need
                                Servlets, JARs, and a few specifications, and we
                                will be good! Ever developed Java web
                                applications? It sucks compared to Rails. You
                                are using the wrong benchmark.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                &quot;&quot;&quot;For those of you that are
                                going to heed Ian's call to arms, please
                                consider productive suggestions that people can
                                follow. If we're not each going to give up our
                                individual toolkits, let's at least agree on the
                                featureset that would make each of them really
                                attractive to new people coming to the Python
                                web space.&quot;&quot;&quot;
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Why wouldn't we give up our individual toolkits?
                                You can't win if you aren't willing to change.
                                You are saying the best we can do is stagnate. I
                                totally disagree.

                                &quot;&quot;&quot;For example, Alex Levy
                                suggests that the problem is documentation:
                                <a
                                    class="reference"
                                    href="http://mesozoic.geecs.org/cogito/archives/000152.html"
                                    >http://mesozoic.geecs.org/cogito/archives/000152.html</a
                                >&quot;&quot;&quot;
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Insufficient solutions with good documentation
                                are still insufficient. Show me something that
                                is as unified, cohesive, and useful as Rails,
                                and is just missing documentation. It doesn't
                                exist.
                            </p>
                            <p>Now, for Ian's response:</p>
                            <p>
                                &quot;&quot;&quot;Well, I personally have
                                resisted the urge to develop a new framework (an
                                urge I've felt many times over the years), and I
                                actually am willing to give up my framework of
                                choice for more conformity. But I can't abandon
                                my framework (and I can't expect anyone else to
                                do so either) -- other people have trusted my
                                opinion and choice over the years, and it would
                                be irresponsible of me to abandon them and those
                                applications I've developed. Which is a bind a
                                lot of us have probably been in. That's one of
                                the things I see in WSGI, is a path out -- a way
                                to support the old apps and consolidate and
                                improve the new apps, without being bogged down
                                in abandoned frameworks and out of date
                                setups.&quot;&quot;&quot;
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I agree with you here Ian. Lets make the WSGI
                                just that -- a way out. But, we shouldn't try to
                                make it the Servlet's of the Python world!
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                &quot;&quot;&quot;Talking to people at PyCon, I
                                don't think I'm altogether unusual. First,
                                there's a lot of people with homegrown
                                frameworks, and from what I can tell this
                                describes most of them -- they are dissatisfied
                                but trapped by their own legacy. But even beyond
                                that there's hope that open source frameworks
                                can consolidate. If we can phrase one framework
                                in terms of another there's the opportunity for
                                the lesser frameworks to melt away, to create a
                                layered environment instead of competing
                                full-featured stacks (well, they are all
                                actually partially-featured
                                stacks).&quot;&quot;&quot;
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Thats very true, and I think you are on to
                                something here. Please, keep preaching it. Maybe
                                you could organize some &quot;summit of web
                                frameworks&quot; or something :) Get the authors
                                of the disparate solutions together, and come up
                                with something better.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                &quot;&quot;&quot;As to Rails: I agree that it's
                                a challenge and a competitor, but it's not a
                                model. People have been working on Rails-like
                                things in Python for a long time, with various
                                successes and failures. But Python's flaw isn't
                                that we don't have any interesting frameworks or
                                interesting MVC systems. Python simply isn't at
                                the same place Ruby is. We have to fix our

                                I don't think we need to clone Rails in Python.
                                Rails is a very ruby-like solution, and there
                                are certainly things I dislike about it. I am
                                not saying we need to model it by copying it: I
                                am saying that we need to model its principles.
                                Its a VERY RUBY, tightly integrated, complete,
                                simple, and fully-functional framework for
                                building web applications from the database all
                                the way up to the top. We need to create a
                                HIGHLY PYTHONIC, tightly integrated, complete,
                                simple, and fully-functional framework as well.
                                It doesn't have to look anything like Rails, but
                                that is our competition. That is our target.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I am not arguing that we need to create an
                                imitator: but we do have to compete on the same
                                level of simplicity and ease of use. PHP and
                                Perl were wildly successful web application
                                languages for some of the same reasons as Rails:
                                simple to install, simple to understand, and
                                documented copiously.

                                    Well, aside from the fact that any incursion
                                    into the Rails site to see what the fuss is
                                    about tends to set off my anti-hype alarms
                                    (even more so than the JBoss site, circa
                                    2001), and even when I've hit the
                                    &quot;master alarm&quot; I just get
                                    presented with various JSP-like endeavours
                                    which are, after the &quot;scaffolding&quot;
                                    is set up (to borrow the Rails terminology),
                                    arguably mostly as easy in a JSP environment
                                    (albeit without the transparent SQL-based
                                    persistence supposedly provided in Rails,

                                    isn't going to show off the power of Rails,
                                    even if the only Rails applications seem to
                                    be &quot;to do&quot; list managers, anyway),
                                    I must regard the framework domination claim
                                    somewhat skeptically.

                                    Ages ago (ie. 1997) solutions like Bobo
                                    provided a clearly better means of
                                    developing Web applications than just using
                                    cgi.py. What then happened was that Bobo
                                    grew into being Zope, and that many
                                    developers did indeed follow that path, thus
                                    forming the Zope and Plone communities which
                                    seem in many respects to be disjoint from
                                    what is now considered to be the mainstream
                                    Python community - in a way, a dominant
                                    solution <em>did</em> emerge, but only as a
                                    parallel community. Meanwhile, in the wider
                                    Python community and inspired by various
                                    other Web programming paradigms, a number of
                                    frameworks emerged and matured to produce
                                    the ecosystem that you see today. Certainly,
                                    Quixote has a certain number of advocates,
                                    but probably nothing like the number of the
                                    solution that is said to have inspired it:
                                    Zope.

                                <p>
                                    &quot;I think its really selfish to hold
                                    onto one's own framework if presented with
                                    the option to unify.&quot;
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    You ignore the fact that most frameworks are
                                    designed to address real situations and
                                    quite possibly function adequately, even
                                    optimally, for their developers. Is it
                                    selfish for someone <em>not</em> to abandon
                                    a framework because it is used in a
                                    production environment and that such
                                    abandonment would force them to migrate
                                    their existing applications for free just
                                    for those applications to function more or
                                    less as they did before? Sure, you get
                                    eventual benefits from your application
                                    suddenly using code that someone else is
                                    maintaining, but then there's always the
                                    temptation to open source your own framework
                                    and to try and get the maintenance
                                    advantages of a larger development community
                                    whilst having everyone else migrating their
                                    applications instead. (I suppose that this
                                    might explain why so many competing
                                    frameworks emerge, even though they often
                                    resemble one another - it's just the
                                    &quot;selfishness&quot; of
                                    <em>not</em> holding onto one's own
                                    framework...)

                                    &quot;Lets make the WSGI just that -- a way
                                    out. But, we shouldn't try to make it the
                                    Servlet's of the Python world!&quot;
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Well, WSGI doesn't really address anything
                                    other than a very basic standardised
                                    environment; not that there isn't merit in
                                    addressing that area, but I was disappointed
                                    that people were happy with just settling
                                    for that, and somewhat disturbed that for
                                    many people WSGI is just something to
                                    believe in whose existence acts as an excuse
                                    for not getting to grips with the harder
                                    issues.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Personally, I don't care about the WSGI
                                    level - I'd rather examine the higher-level
                                    concepts which applications use directly to
                                    behave in the ways that they do. After using
                                    Webware a fair amount, I wanted to
                                    experiment with other frameworks if only to
                                    avoid various pitfalls and issues that
                                    Webware had, but I didn't want to rewrite my
                                    framework and applications to make them run
                                    on Twisted (for example). In the end, I
                                    created WebStack to enable this whilst
                                    papering over some of the bizarre behaviour
                                    of various frameworks. For me, WebStack
                                    &quot;scratches my itch&quot; because I can
                                    now ignore framework issues and concentrate
                                    on actual applications.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    So for me the framework wars are over. I
                                    don't care about the &quot;distinctive&quot;
                                    things that many frameworks promote (ie. the
                                    special template language or the URL
                                    dispatching scheme that should in any case
                                    really be determined by the application
                                    being written) - I just want a sane API
                                    which mostly returns request parameters,
                                    streams, sessions, cookies and so on and
                                    which doesn't force me to have to reinvent
                                    several wheels in every application I write,
                                    just because of some misguided minimalist
                                    agenda on the part of the framework
                                    designer. And if I want my application to
                                    appear at
                                    <a
                                        class="reference"
                                        href="http://mysite/zope/folder/myapp"
                                        >http://mysite/zope/folder/myapp</a

                                        I agree with you in part Paul. And I
                                        shouldn't have used the word
                                        &quot;suck&quot; to describe any of the
                                        existing frameworks, as they still beat
                                        the pants off of anything available for
                                        PHP or Perl. The people who work on
                                        those frameworks can and should be proud
                                        of them. But, I do believe that they
                                        don't stack up to Rails. I agree that
                                        their hype machine is running at full
                                        steam, and that is pretty obnoxious.
                                        But, its hard to deny the traction they
                                        are getting.

                                        And, no, they aren't doing anything all
                                        that impressive technically. People have
                                        been writing bits and pieces of the
                                        Rails framework in Python for years and
                                        years. But, they aren't putting all the
                                        pieces together in a simple way and
                                        working together to create a singular
                                        foundation. Rails is doing it well,
                                        doing it all, documenting it, and
                                        getting it publicized. I just wish that
                                        we had something comparable.

                                        That's what my talk at PyCon was about,
                                        and I want to re-express all those same
                                        ideas here as articles. WSGIKit is an
                                        architecture that uses WSGI as the way
                                        to pull together those higher-level
                                        concepts -- it's using WSGI as much more
                                        than a generic way to connect to a
                                        server. If all WSGI did was connect apps
                                        to server, it would be useful but indeed
                                        quite boring -- but WSGI is really a
                                        sneaky way of creating a standard
                                        request and response object, and a
                                        pattern for providing a stack of
                                        filters. And that <em>is</em> a big
                                        deal, even if it isn't an end in itself.

                                            knowing much about twisted, though
                                            you do eventually need to pick up
                                            some twisted basics like deferreds,
                                            adapters, realms, etc. to be fully

                                            with Nevow as an application
                                            framework is the lack of integration
                                            with an ORM and the immaturity of
                                            some parts (e.g. formless needs a

                        John, Rails is far from the only web app framework for
                        Ruby. Other competent ones (i.e. used in production) are
                        Nitro and IOWA. Several others exist which are probably
                        little more than hobbies. That's not to put them down:
                        some of them showcase excellent techniques and are an
                        important part of the ecosystem.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Anyway, just wanted to clear up that misconception.
                        Rails is, IMO, the best webapp framework for Ruby in
                        every way, and it's certainly the dominant one, but it
                        has prospered _despite_ being one of many choices. It
                        wasn't a Ruby community effort to present a dominant
                        framework to the world; it was the hard work of one
                        person.

                    <p>
                        The &quot;too much choice&quot; argument regarding
                        Python web programming has a valid point, but it's not
                        fully convincing.

                    This is very true. In my environment (database support,
                    FWIW) I find that most of the utility-type programs I write
                    fall into one of two categories - server-side
                    utilities/daemons (with a command line interface at best) or
                    web applications.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For web applications, I'd love to use Python. I've tried,
                    often enough. But this is &quot;internal&quot; software, and
                    it's hard to get any time to spend on it. So I have to be
                    able to get a basic, good looking (I know, but it matters to
                    management :-() application, up and running
                    <strong>fast</strong>. Python can't really do this, as
                    things stand.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The type of application I'm talking about isn't fancy - a
                    very basic CRUD (Create, Report, Update, Delete) application
                    is all I need as a start. Once I've got that sanctioned and
                    running, adding the extra bells and whistles is a lot easier
                    to get agreement to. This is where, in my view, Rails scores
                    - it's a &quot;build the basic application in a day&quot;
                    environment, with the flexibility to grow once the initial
                    system is in place.
                </p>
                <p>
                    FWIW, being an Oracle environment, we've started using
                    Oracle's proprietary HTML DB system. It's nice for that
                    basic CRUD system, and it's got a reasonably nice-looking
                    set of default templates (with slick bells and whistles like
                    tabbed dialogs, which always impress people :-)). But it's
                    an unholy nightmare to extend. And yet that doesn't matter,
                    because the initial development is so simple...
                </p>
                <p>
                    So there's a challenge. If someone were to develop a Python
                    framework which made writing a basic CRUD application a
                    simple matter, coupled with some good,
                    &quot;professional-looking&quot; templates, I'd bite your
                    hand off to get it.

                    <p>
                        I'd like to pipe in with my agreement regarding the true
                        problem here. SQLObject is a good, transparent ORM.
                        Nevow, Quixote and CherryPy are all quite reasonable
                        object publishers. Cheetah or one of the XML template
                        systems (ZPT, Kid, etc.) are decent template systems.
                        The parts are all there. Because of distutils, they're
                        even pretty easy to install.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The problem is that once you've got them installed,
                        you're sitting there with a blank directory, wondering
                        what to do next. Reading through the docs of the various
                        projects will give you some ideas, but you don't get a
                        great feeling about things because you're not really
                        sure how to kick things off and make something visible
                        that you can put your arms around and start improving. I
                        do test-driven development and find that it helps, but a
                        project really takes off once you've got something to
                        grab onto.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        That's what Rails offers that none of the current Python
                        solutions does: a way to get going nearly instantly. So
                        much so, that they can create a 10 minute demo video.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A large number of applications are all about CRUD. Sure,
                        they all have their own wrinkles, but if you can give
                        someone a quick start with CRUD and easy ways to grow
                        from there, you've got yourself a winner with a big
                        chunk of apps.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Subway can do this (but, I haven't looked closely enough
                        at it to know if that's where it's heading). Bringing
                        this kind of CRUD quickstart would at least let Python
                        catch up with Rails.

                        <p>
                            As Ian pointed out in another posting, and you say
                            here, Python has all the bits. What it lacks is the
                            &quot;quickstart&quot; appeal. Whatever you call it,
                            that's what's missing. And I don't see this as
                            &quot;playing catchup to Rails&quot; - it's a simple
                            case of providing entry-level, tutorial type
                            documentation and sample material (something that
                            open source projects are notoriously lacking in,
                            because none of us like writing it).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I don't think there's any need to evangelise a
                            &quot;one true system&quot; for object publishing,
                            or for templating, or whatever. Each has its
                            strengths and weaknesses. But picking one set (and
                            accepting the compromises) and doing a really good
                            job of putting that quickstart tutorial together
                            will add something extra to the mix. Subway sounds
                            interesting, but a first glance makes it look like
                            (more) packaging and &quot;layers&quot;. I'm
                            <strong>happy</strong> with a toolkit of
                            &quot;bits&quot;. I don't really want a packaged
                            solution, I want a first step up.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Heck, I'm very close to going it alone, and building
                            something for myself. I found a document the other
                            day called &quot;Four Days on Rails&quot;, which
                            went the step past the 10-minute demo video, and
                            showed how to start customising the initial
                            application. I'm seriously considering doing
                            something similar for Python, starting from
                            SQLObject, Cheetah, and Quixote (or maybe CherryPy).
                            But my graphic design skills are <em>dire</em>. I'm
                            going to find it very hard to write something along
                            the lines of &quot;look - it's easy to build a basic
                            web application in Python&quot; when I can't even
                            stomach the look of the result myself :-)
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I don't know if I'll ever get round to doing this
                            (my life is a mess of part-completed projects...)
                            but I'm not sure that waiting and hoping someone
                            else will do it for me is going to work, either.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            (And I even looked at Rails, but I can't get my head
                            round Ruby so I'm probably safe from the temptation
                            to swap languages for a while yet...)

                    Jonathan, I'm going to agree with most of your statements.
                    But I'd like to tell you a little something, because you
                    might find it enlightening.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You said, &quot;<em
                        >Everything that makes Python great doesn't mean much to

                    >&quot;

                <p>
                    Recently, I did a risk analysis for Lockheed Martin where we
                    compared some of the major up-and-coming popular
                    &quot;scripting&quot; languages. I chose Python, Ruby, Lua,
                    Ocaml, and Erlang as examples of languages with strong but
                    somewhat hidden support. These are the folks that I feel are
                    the up-and-comers. So we did an analysis, comparing
                    stylistic differences, typing, testability, readability,
                    usability (as in number of libraries), and maintainability
                    (what companies could offer sustainment with these
                    languages). The risk scale went from white (0 risk) to green
                    (not too risky) to yellow (risky) to red (too risky).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Python was the <strong>only</strong> contender in this list
                    that's in the green. When I spoke with middle-line managers
                    and the hollow once-engineers who hadn't done any real work
                    for years--now doing &quot;engineering management&quot; and
                    &quot;proposals&quot;--Python had the most favorable
                    impression. They loved the idea of things like significant
                    whitespace, because (and I quote this), &quot;It makes
                    people's code more similar.&quot; It also helps reduce the
                    burden of people who draft up code standards. Other popular
                    features were garbage collection, familiar syntax, and the
                    fewest &quot;new methodologies&quot; for programmers to
                    learn. Now, maybe my bias is showing here, I'm not a huge
                    Python fan. For that reason, I had the other engineer on my
                    project, who is a big Python fan, handle Python. I thought
                    it was interesting that the same things I thought were
                    weaknesses of Python turned out to be strengths in the eyes
                    of our review.
                </p>
                <p>
                    But as I was doing this comparison, I realized something. If
                    the Revolution were to happen today and Java and C++ were
                    shot in front of the wall, Python would be one to rise to
                    dominance. Because, when you get right down to it, Python is
                    the least different.

                    Ah sadly one of the great recurring themes in the python
                    world.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I (and others) have repeatedly had this discussion. As a non
                    uber-geek (in python or elsewhere) I can say the impression
                    I've gotten over time, repeatedly, is that many people who
                    write python are too damn smart. They say &quot;look, we've
                    got great libs that do X Y and Z. Just put 'em
                    together!&quot; Fine. If you're a really good developer,
                    that's likely workable for you. Especially if you're working
                    on a large complicated project, with lots of other really
                    smart people like yourself.
                </p>
                <p>
                    But there is a huge class of (&quot;under&quot;)developers,
                    who either don't have the skills, experience and/or time to
                    do this. It is these people who end up falling back on PHP,
                    or increasingly, Rails, as it caters to a more RAD approach
                    than putting together python libs. And the sheer numbers of
                    these people have a huge effect on public perception and
                    language penetration - that PHP trendline surely isn't
                    measuring high-quality applications. Yet decision-makers see
                    that trend, and are reassured; publishers see it and see
                    &quot;okay, we can publish a book on this&quot;; ISPs see it
                    and say &quot;okay, we need to look into supporting
                    this&quot;. Python developers seem to see it and say
                    &quot;but, yeah, almost all of those apps are crappy and
                    written by script kiddies&quot;. Yes. Probably, but that's
                    not the salient point here IMHO.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For example, Quixote is very nice inside - but it is
                    certainly not packaged(docs/site/etc) or presented as
                    something Joe Developer can start running with. It is
                    clearly used and aimed at experienced and smart people. That
                    limits its exposure. Which is probably fine - less support
                    needed on a mailing list, and they have a great tool for
                    their needs. Zope/Plone is just not something many will
                    consider, for various reasons. It's complexity and
                    opaqueness being the initial ones, but that's a
                    near-religious argument I'm not looking to get into.
                    CherryPy, again nice, but pretty barebones still last I
                    checked. Great if you want a base tool to build on. Maybe
                    akin to a java servlet container, but not a cohesive stack.

                    Also, a key point on Rails that David (original coder,
                    current leader) mentions often, is that the framework was
                    <em>extracted</em>, not designed on paper. And, less
                    mentioned, but to me seemingly as important, it was
                    basically done by one person. The original 'spirit' is very
                    cohesive because of this - like a novel written by one
                    person compared to being assembled and written by committee.
                    This is why I'd guess projects like Subway will have trouble
                    &quot;gelling&quot; into any similar sort of cohesiveness.
                    Not that it's impossible to blend frameworks seamlessly, but
                    I'd say much harder.

                    I only hang around these discussions because I would much
                    rather write python than ruby, but Rails has presented an
                    unbeatable argument at this point, that nothing in python
                    matches. And I'm far from the only one with this opinion. I
                    think the only way a viable competitor will arise is if a
                    small team or individual takes the initiative and does it -
                    summits, merging projects, etc. are not likely to work based
                    on past examples. Perhaps the project/framework mentioned by
                    holovaty.com (Adam? sorry can't see the comment while typing
                    this) will be one to take this shape, arising out of a small
                    team I believe (kansas.com?).
                </p>

                    Okay enough from my peanut gallery. Thanks for raising the
                    issue again - hopefully for the near-last time?

                        I think you are right on the money! This is analagous to
                        the ballyhooing that comes from the Postgres group about
                        MySQL. Sure, it's got the bells and whistles and can
                        also make sandwiches, but it was lost on them that it
                        was the ease of use coming in and relaxed learning curve
                        of MySQL (not to mention that it could also run on
                        Windows) that helped it's popularity.

                        I have this sinking feeling that new easy to grok simple
                        languages will allways spread faster than OOL's. It's
                        easier for a noob to understand logic first then
                        paradigm later. If he doesn't have to deal with learning
                        OO (as an example) at the onset he gets down to the
                        business of writing code a lot faster than one who does.

                        Seriously, the group of people that you want are the
                        young kids that some have termed &quot;script
                        kiddies&quot;. They are the ones that get excited about
                        it and turn it into something cool. As far back as '98
                        people were talking about how cool PHP is and before
                        that they talked abuot how cool Perl is. But nobody was
                        talking about how cool Python is. That talked seemed
                        limited to people on high horses looking down on the
                        hordes of kiddies. A gret many of whom grew up (a little
                        at least) and began influencing those (like managers and
                        publishers) around them. And if that influence wasn't at
                        first by jaw, then it was by example.

                        Please don't take this the wrong way. I am someone that
                        makes a living with PHP, but I just adore Python
                        (inspite of the fact that I also love the Curly Brace).
                        It's an awesome language! However, if it's a popularity
                        game we are talking about, simplicity is the ulitmate
                        trump card. PHP has that.

                        my mind around why a 'new style class' is better than an
                        old style one, and the use case for meta-classes escapes
                        me. Maybe the answer, then, is a custom apache

                    Re Ruby on Rails - personally tried enough frameworks to
                    want to wait a long time before committing real effort to
                    it. Have a rule these days not to take frameworks seriously
                    until someone is able to describe how it &quot;sucks&quot;.
                    At that point the sort of insight required to build real
                    apps with it starts popping out. ROR is still on the hype
                    curve right now.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It's great that it's become a focal point for many
                    developers, something lacking for any equivalent Perl, PHP
                    or Python framework. That guarantees a longish future and no
                    doubt plenty of supporting libraries, both important for
                    betting your development project on it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    But The make-or-break for me is the &quot;edge cases&quot;
                    (the moment you step beyond CRUD), plus how things start to
                    look when the feature list grows.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Specifically, a couple of issues I have from doing nothing
                    more than trawling ROR documentation (which should probably
                    be directed at a mailing list but David H scares me;), so
                    here goes...
                </p>
                <p>
                    I've seen the approach of mapping actions directly to
                    methods before in a PHP framework called ISMO (<a
                        class="reference"
                        href="http://ismo.morrdusk.net/"
                        >http://ismo.morrdusk.net/</a
                    >). From trying one project in anger with it - started off
                    nicely but breaks down when you start needing to implement
                    things like a authentication with permissions global
                    behaviour (read Intercepting Filter) which needs to be
                    bubble through to individual actions. Also things like an
                    Application Controller, such as for a form with multiple
                    parts, required blood. Perhaps Ruby can prevent the same
                    happening with Rails in a way that PHP can't but need to see
                    that before I believe.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Otherwise Ruby on Rails lacks ease of deployment right now.
                    As I see it only &quot;ASP&quot; type technologies can
                    deliver that, number 1 now being PHP. And ease of deployment
                    is not just a feature for newbies. It opens up options like
                    &quot;just in time&quot; code generation and caching which,
                    in turn, create new possibilities for optimization and
                    scaling smoothly. Along those lines, another rule I have
                    these days is if it does l10n at runtime, move swiftly on.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Sick as it may seem, I'd recommend exploring Python as an
                    active generator for PHP (i.e. you never touch / extend the
                    PHP yourself); Python working as the design / modeling tool.
                    In general PHP &quot;works best&quot; when it violates all
                    rules of sane programming (other than security of course);
                    as raw spagetti, perhaps because PHP was always meant to be
                    just a template language.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The spagetti nature of PHP can be preserved while employing
                    sane coding practices by using code generation. Right now
                    the tools aren't there and no one's really explored the
                    potential. The furthest walk I've seen in that direction is
                    Scriptol -
                    <a class="reference" href="http://www.scriptol.com/"
                        >http://www.scriptol.com/</a
                    >
                    and some template engines written in PHP itself, such as
                    WACT's
                    <a
                        class="reference"
                        href="http://wact.sourceforge.net/index.php/TemplateComponentArchitecture"
                        >http://wact.sourceforge.net/index.php/TemplateComponentArchitecture</a
                    >.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Stepping out of what platform makes most sense for a moment,
                    PHP's installed base represents opportunity for anyone
                    writing applications which target it and figure that's the
                    bottom line. There's a joke, where I came from, about the
                    answer you'll get if you ask a local farmer for directions:
                    &quot;Ooooh, you don't want to start from here!&quot;

                            specific application, where the design stage
                            involves a narrower range of choices, it can work
                            well.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            There's a perfect example I forgot - Worksheet
                            Server:
                            <a class="reference" href="http://www.jedox.com/"
                                >http://www.jedox.com/</a
                            >. Design / development is done with Excel and the
                            generated PHP code is not meant to be touched
                            directly - it behaves something like a
                            &quot;component&quot; on the web server. Further
                            changes are made in Excel, overwriting the previous
                            set of generated PHP code. So PHP acts as something
                            like the &quot;byte code&quot; of a Worksheet Server
                            &quot;runtime&quot;. Did a review of it a while back
                            <a
                                class="reference"
                                href="http://www.sitepoint.com/article/php-apps-excel-worksheet-server"
                                >http://www.sitepoint.com/article/php-apps-excel-worksheet-server</a
                            >.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            And a potential candidate would be tools like JAlbum
                            (<a class="reference" href="http://jalbum.net/"
                                >http://jalbum.net/</a
                            >) which normally spit out HTML. Could easily be
                            used to spit out PHP and add all those features some
                            people seem to appreciate on their galleries, such
                            as hit counts and comments.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Otherwise the devil is in the details - I don't see
                            debugging horrors and deployment nightmares as
                            givens - depends what you're doing and how you do
                            it. Sure anything that involves generating code will
                            itself require significant development overhead but
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            As one simple example of Python aiding PHP
                            development, using Ned Bachelors COG, you might have
                            something like:
                        </p>
                        <pre class="literal-block">

# While developing use this (will be replaced by COG)
$db = DB::connect(&quot;pgsql://devuser:password&#64;localhost/myapp&quot;);

//[[[end]]]

# Continue with PHP script...

                        <p>
                            The PHP script is still executable while hacking /
                            debugging is in progress. Deployment could be a
                            Python script that runs COG over the source then
                            copies it to the producive environment, replacing
                            previous versions.

                        I've been shopping web frameworks for 3.5 years now.
                        Really just window shopping - I've had project ideas but
                        not the inclination to pursue them in my limited time.
                        Now that I've finished school and only work full-time
                        this has changed a bit, and I've gotten more serious
                        about a project. I still don't know if it would have
                        gotten off the ground except for Rails.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I've developed with MS technologies for about 7 years
                        and the last couple has been mostly web apps with
                        ASP.NET/C#. For a long time, I've been deciding which
                        Java frameworks I would use for my independent
                        work...I've played with all the struts, spring, webwork,
                        tapestry as well as a couple ORMs (thought I really
                        liked Hibernate)and had pieced together what my
                        &quot;stack&quot; would be. I really like the toolsets
                        and active community there. For a long time, I've also
                        been in love with Python but have never really gotten
                        past &quot;Whetting your Appetite&quot;. CherryPy really
                        peaked my interest at one point and I even found
                        well-priced hosting that supported it but I never went
                        anywhere with it. I remember playing with Zope (at
                        least, Zope DB) a little bit but didn't get far. Cannot
                        say why now (it was quite a long time ago) and
                        unfortunately I'm out of the market for the time being.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Maybe I am just a sucker for hype but Rails got me
                        moving. I found a hosting provider to support me (and
                        for a bargain rate, great service so far). Once I was
                        sure I could actually deploy my application I started
                        building it. This is after doing nothing but idly
                        looking at various frameworks, reading various websites,
                        following several communities over a period of years
                        with only a few concepts for potential projects in the
                        back of my mind. Rails HOOKED me. I had barely learned
                        anything about Ruby before learning about Rails (what
                        little I had learnedI liked less than Python, and as it
                        didn't have a web framework of note I didn't pursue it
                        further). I think Rails has taught me somethings about
                        Ruby that I now appreciate more, but I still have a long
                        way to go and ultimately don't know how I will feel
                        about Ruby as a language.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Please understand, the rails tutorials and scaffolding
                        have done nearly as much harm as they have good for
                        Rails (and that is saying a lot). Rails != scaffold.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Yes, Rails views look like ASP/JSP/PHP spaghetti code.
                        They are different, and you can find out why if you read
                        more of David's holy writ but even better if you
                        experience it for yourself. The framework guides you by
                        convention to do things properly. Coming from standard
                        ASP &amp; ASP.NET, I never fully grokked MVC (I
                        understand it, but I haven't lived it). I was often
                        paralyzed by questions of &quot;where does this type
                        logic go&quot;. Rails seems to be telling me, and
                        telling me in ways that I don't feel anxious or guilty
                        about, and telling me quickly.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Really what attracted me to Rails though is not the hype
                        or the scaffold or the 10 minute demo, although that
                        certainly helps when I feel I'm making really rapid
                        progress. What attracted me is the philosophy. Don't
                        repeat yourself. Use convention instead of
                        configuration. After using ActiveRecord going back and
                        doing Hibernate (even with everything its tools can
                        generate for me) really makes me sick. After using
                        ActiveController and ActiveView, the idea of the struts
                        or springs XML config approach makes me sick. Of course,
                        ASP.NET makes me sick just by being what it is and by
                        the generally accepted practices associated with it
                        (same with PHP).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Truly, I don't have the Python experience to speak to it
                        in ways I can speak to Java and MS technologies. But
                        Rails sold me in minutes, and I've been shopping a long
                        time. If the Python community can develop something as
                        cohesive and/or market it as well, then it can win.
                        Python I think is unquestionably a better
                        general-purpose language than Ruby still, just based on
                        its library and tool support as well as it its
                        distribution and mind share. But you might not have that
                        much time.

                    I totally agree with your thoughts. However, I think the
                    solution will be simpler than you think: Through Ironpython,
                    Python will be able to leverage all the power of ASP.NET

                        .NET is very, very similar to Java (the platform, not
                        the language). We're talking about wanting very
                        high-level web frameworks, and I know that the closest
                        you get on Java is RIFE. I don't know about .NET.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The trouble is that frameworks for .NET and the JVM are
                        designed primarily for statically typed languages that
                        don't offer cool features like metaclasses. I've used
                        Hibernate extensively, and I can safely say that
                        SQLObject (and ActiveRecord, I'm sure) are
                        <em>much</em> easier, because the language offers
                        features to support that kind of thing.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        So, while it may be nice to be able to call .NET and
                        Java code, that is not really a big win in terms of web
                        development productivity.

                    It can be anything from help with making HTML to Content
                    Management Systems to Database Accessing Frameworks to
                    advanced templating and forms handling.

                    Depending on the audience, different solutions are needed,
                    and I can't tell what audience you are aiming for. This is
                    too hand-wavy a problem definition to yield any useful
                    answers.

                    I think the problem is one of &quot;product design&quot; and
                    &quot;usability analysis&quot; more than anything else:
                    What's lacking is a single easy to pick up choice that
                    combines the parts that already exist, documents them well,
                    adds easy tutorials, and makes it easy to package and deploy
                    the resulting web apps. Then hype the heck out of it like
                    Rails. The current choices for Python web development seem
                    either in involve way too steep of a learning curve or
                    aren't really complete on their own.

                    &lt;plug&gt; I'm yet another developer who set out to create
                    the nicely integrated tight-stack RAD web app framework for
                    Python. However I didn't start from scratch but instead
                    chose Quixote as the underlying framework (very Pythonic, if
                    not the most IMO) and built up from there. The result of
                    that is

                        >http://www.qlime.org/</a
                    >. Anyway it was interesting going through the article and
                    comments to see what people are looking for. I'd be thrilled
                    to get more feedback regarding my framework from end users.
                    QLime hasn't reached 1.0 yet and significant design
                    decisions can still be made. I'd rather be building what
                    people are going to use. &lt;/plug&gt;
                </p>
                <p>
                    One of the reasons why there are many frameworks is that
                    Python is inherently easy and inviting for developers. Why
                    learn the details of an existing framework when it's easy
                    (and fun) to just write my own? Which will also work exactly
                    as I think it should work.
                </p>

                    Every programmer I know did the same thing I did when they

                    A 30 second experience. Fixing THAT is what &quot;Matters
                    Most&quot; for Python. Until you do, it will continue to be

                        I almost did it myself (drag to recycle bin) when I
                        first found Python. The only reason I kept it (and am I
                        glad I did!) was because it was recommended by a
                        coworker (programmer) whos skills I highly respected.
                        Soon I realized there was really nothing to be afraid
                        of, my productivity soared and now it's my first choice
                        for most tasks. It was an important life lesson too - to
                        be wary of my own prejudice when encountering something
                        new. I now realize my traumatic experience with COBOL in
                        school, and the fact that most languages don't use
                        whitespace, had built my prejudice.

This thing about indentation/whitespace has dogged python forever. Personally, I think it is
a great feature, but for those who won't touch python without curly braces, there is an easy fix:

Just accept an alternate form of blocks, which is:


  xxx ... {
  code          # Note: code here is deliberately randomly indented.
    code
   code
  }


instead of


  xxx ... :
    code
    code
    code







right in the Python compiler. (I can hear all you python zealots scream so loud :)
since it breaks the 'one way to do it', and pushes a stake right through the heart
of the indentation based readability, but hey why not?

I have often thought of whipping out a perl (sorry) preprocessor script that could take
such braces based syntax and turn that to standard indentation based syntax, but it
is best done right within the python compiler and interpretor: maybe allow a
new command-line option that allows for braces based blocks.

                        If Python were like &quot;every other&quot; programming

                        Python does appeal to programmers. When you are sick of
                        your current language and you want something better, you
                        finally decide to do more than dip your toe in. Or that
                        super programmer down the row who you respect, because
                        he really is very good at programming keeps telling you
                        Python is worth learning. You finally break down and
                        start playing with it. Or you think LISP is really cool,
                        but not really practical these days and you look to
                        Python.

                    <p>
                        Whatever, but it takes some effort to learn a new
                        language. If the new language were just like your old
                        language, you wouldn't be making the effort to learn it.

                        where the programmer used no whitespace to denote
                        structure? Or worse yet had incorrect indentation? It
                        would be horrible. The first thing you'd do was fix it,
                        curly braces or not. You need the whitespace. So who
                        cares about the curly braces? They don't matter.
                        Indentation is what matters.

                        I ran across a really good quote recently. It kind of
                        fits the whole whitespace argument. The thought being
                        that the way Python does whitespace is a really good
                        idea:

                        That's odd. I had the opposite experience. Personally,
                        it took a few minutes for me to get over the whitespace,
                        but most of the programmers I've introduced it to
                        haven't cared. Of course, many of them are used to
                        various 4gl-ish vertical-app languages, so maybe it's
                        not too representative...

                        (and are willing to adapt a little to best leverage the
                        tool) and those who trash anything not &quot;just

                    As a Python lover who also uses PHP extensively, I find that
                    Spyce (
                    <a class="reference" href="http://spyce.sourceforge.net"
                        >http://spyce.sourceforge.net</a
                    >
                    ) is the Python web programming solution that is closest in
                    spirit to PHP. With Spyce, all the right ingredients that
                    made for PHP's [initial] success, such as immediacy of
                    learning and integration into an HTML page, are made
                    available while straying as little as possible from how you
                    normally do Python programming (read: nothing much new to
                    learn).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Spyce's Pythonic design involves a small amount of carefully
                    designed features which:
                </p>
                <ol class="arabic simple">
                    <li>
                        provides powerful HTML-integration features more on par
                        with JSP (such as rockin' custom tags) than PHP (whose
                        tag-related features you need to boost with outside help
                        such as Smarty)
                    </li>
                    <li>retains the ease and cleanliness of basic PHP</li>
                    <li>
                        lets you reuse what Python already does well, with the
                        least distraction
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        allows extension with template processors (such as
                        Cheetah)
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    Spyce has been around for a while and mature and stable
                    enough for 'heavy lifting'. It was what I settled on after
                    evaluating roughly a dozen other Python web frameworks
                    including CherryPy, Quixote, Skunk, Zope, and Webware, none
                    of which, imo, offered the clarity and ease of HTML
                    integration that PHP provides and thus were not satisfactory
                    alternatives.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Spyce can be made to run on commodity hosting that supports
                    CGI and Python (99.9% do) easily by:
                </p>
                <ol class="loweralpha simple">
                    <li>
                        just copying over the Spyce files under a cgi-bin
                        directory
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        creating a 2-3 line .htaccess file in a directory where
                        your .spy files will run
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    Voila! You now have Spyce working together with all the
                    features that a Python program on that server has access to
                    (including MySQL, SMTP, etc...)
                </p>
                <p>
                    Spyce can also work on top of fastCGI, mod_python as well as
                    its own server proxying behind Apache or other web server.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Oh... and before I forget... if its default [[ and ]]
                    delimiter tags turn you off, you can use the more
                    conventional &lt;% and %&gt; instead.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The final icing on the cake is that the free SciTE (
                    <a class="reference" href="http://www.scintilla.org"
                        >http://www.scintilla.org</a
                    >
                    ) editor can beautifully highlight HTML, Javascript and
                    Spyce code separately when you use &lt;% %&gt; and enable
                    'asp.default.language=3' in its 'html.properties'
                    configuration file!

                    Hi Ian. I agree with you absolutely. Too bad Guido do not
                    concern web development that much. Even if he does not do
                    web related work directly he should deputize a team to come
                    up with a solution within certain time frame. If ever Python
                    come out with any clout like Rudy on rail I can see its user
                    base easily double or triple.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Talking about Ruby on rail its momentum does startle me. But
                    I think more importantly it should be consider an
                    inspiration for the Python community. It is easy for a
                    talented Python developer to crank out a well designed
                    framework. But what really counts is the user base and
                    public awareness. The way Ruby on rail takes on the audience
                    shows there are still opportunities in web development, and
                    that PHP and Java still sucks.

                        But, on the other hand, I totally agree with Jonathan
                        when he says that the Python community should only focus
                        on some solutions though I think we should act on two

                            so that it attracts newbies. PHP works great because
                            it doesn't force you to use a complex framework like
                            J2EE or .NET

                        I've found all that burden around Rail really sane for
                        the Python community which sometimes is really quick to
                        think Python is the best so we don't need to keep on
                        going on. Python community is a bit self-centric
                        sometimes where Ruby community is not ('till now).

                        to decide in terms of web frameworks. We can't rely only
                        on one unique individual.

                        <p>
                            So Guido does not directly invoked in any web
                            development himself. But I bet he would concern
                            about the market of Python and he would be a cheif
                            evangelist himself. And here our believe is
                            positioning Python as a premier web development tool
                            is the top most important thing you can do to market
                            Python.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I don't expect Guido to have any role in designing
                            of picking the best framework. The best thing he can
                            do is to be a catalyst to help the community to
                            arrive to a better solution.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            By the way I like your idea of having several layers
                            of framework (like JSP and Struts). If the higher
                            layer is build on top of lower layer that would be
                            even better.

                Couldn't agree more. Have developed untold lines of software in
                everything from Fortran/Basic/Pascal/Forth/APL, to
                C/C++/ObjC/Java and Python. While I still use C/C++/ObjC/Java
                occasionally, I stick to Python whenever I can because it is
                just better. That said however, I share the concern for Python's
                future because I'm selfish and don't want my Python relegated to
                the scrape heap of unsupported languages somewhere down the
                road. I fear that Python's inability to cohesively embrace the
                challenge of web-based apps provides too much opening for some
                lesser species to proliferate and push out other options in the

                    I do agree on what Ian is saying, but I want to go forward.
                    I've tried to write down the requirements the 'ultimate'
                    Python web framework needs to comply to. PHP supports all of
                    these:
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                    <ul class="simple">
                        <li>
                            a template syntax that can mix fixed HTML with
                            generated code. Sadly enough the whitespace of
                            Python does not fit very well with HTML. There have
                            been numerous attemps to overcome this (Quixote ptl,
                            psp, ...) but none of them are as easy as PHP. I
                            think this is the main reason why Python keeps on
                            struggling to become a very popular Web language.
                            This one will be the main hurdle to get an agreement
                            on because of the legacy of the existing templates
                            systems

                        <li>
                            a simple relationship: a web page is a file. Storing
                            web pages in an object database (the Zope way) only
                            increases complexity: it requires specific tools to
                            do ftp, webdav, ..., while it does not bring
                            anything more than the file system does. A web page
                            can be an object if we stick to the 'one object in
                            one file' rule.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            a RDMBS back end. While pyhton lovers will argue
                            that a ptyhon object store is more pythonic, these
                            object stores lacks the features of RDMBS like MySQL
                            and Oracle: robustness, backup/restore ,
                            scalability, replication, transactional behaviour,
                            ... People are scared to put 2 Gb of critical
                            business data in an 'unknown' OO database. SQLObject
                            might do the job to link to the back-end.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            non stop behaviour. Most Python web framework
                            requires you to stop and restart the framework when
                            you add/edit/delete a web page. In most case a web
                            page is directly linked to a Python object, which
                            cannot be easily removed/modified from a running
                            Python process. This behaviour is not acceptable for
                            operational sites. Or we need to go away from the
                            paradigm 'a web page is a Python object' or we need
                            to solve remove/modify objects issue.

                        <li>
                            a decent release policy (and not like Webware who
                            lives in the SVN repository for the last 2 years)
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            a good Apache integration (both release 1 and 2)

                        <li>
                            a good persistent session management (not like
                            Quixote). PHP dumps session info in ordinary files,
                            which is not nice, but it works.

                    Looking at the existing web framework we have (Quixote,
                    Webware, CherryPy, SnakeLets, mod_python, ...) all of the
                    frameworks miss at least one. Only if we have a framework
                    that complies to all of these requirements, we can go for
                    the last one:

                    <p>
                        I agree although a little more moderately. I am a Python
                        web developer and have been able to meet any customer
                        requirements using either Webware or Plone/Zope.

                    <p>
                        And I would argue that the reality is Zope has become
                        THE Python Web framework. Does that mean we should stop
                        working on WSGI? No. But Zope and Plone now have
                        significant backing from large organizations. Plone/Zope
                        is the official web platform for several federal
                        agencies including NASA, NOAA, and the U.S. Navy. And
                        even more large commercial companies have settled on
                        Zope including Intuit and SGI. Like it or not that's a
                        lot of market share and name recognition. Plus there are
                        plenty of mom and pop sites running Zope as well. It
                        seems that the Web has declared Plone/Zope a definite
                        leader among web frameworks in general.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        And as far as the core language, Python's weak XML
                        support is a far greater threat to its success as both a
                        web and general purpose language.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Web services and other web-related XML standards are
                        becoming more important than any given web framework or
                        paradigm in software development. J2EE and .NET are
                        killing Python in the SOAP arena not to mention all of
                        the other places where XML is applied heavily.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Count how many SOAP examples are in the latest edition
                        of the &quot;Python Cookbook&quot; (Answer: 0). Also
                        count the number of core Python libraries related to
                        Web/Network programming versus the ones related to
                        modern XML standards.

                        And if you still have doubts about Python's suitability

                        they feel about it :-)

                            As for your point about Zope being the de-facto
                            standard, I agree. I'd also point out that there has
                            been plenty of conversation about finding ways to
                            use the Twisted framework for Zope's network
                            plumbing, so that Zope can be more focused on its
                            core problem domains. Also, Jim Fulton (the Zope
                            Pope) has stated that he would like to incorporate
                            some of the desirable features of the Nevow
                            framework. The Twisted folks, for their part, have
                            dropped their Interface implementation in favor of
                            the one used in Zope 3.

                        <p>
                            Now, my point in rambling on about this stuff is
                            that I like the standardization that I've described
                            above, because it happened naturally. Nobody had a
                            big summit to lay down the law or make sweeping
                            pronouncements. I hate the kind of standardization
                            being argued for in this topic, because it is an
                            attempt to dictate a &quot;winner&quot; technology
                            stack, instead of letting the winning combination be
                            determined by the only measure that matters, which
                            is utilization in the field.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The irony here is that there is so much talk about
                            creating a standard, about limiting choices, about
                            making it easy for developers to avoid thinking
                            about which technology to use when building a web
                            application; Rails is just a framework that somebody
                            built to solve some problems, and it happens to be
                            evolving into a de-facto standard in Ruby-land. No
                            voting or consensus involved, just natural forces at
                            work.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            What is being proposed here will fail, because it is
                            an artificial, design-by-committee solution to a
                            fictitious problem. Somebody, anybody, please give
                            me a real example of how it is so easy to do X in
                            Rails/PHP/whatever, and how it is just so much
                            harder to do in Zope/Twisted/whatever.

                            <p>
                                While on some level &quot;standards&quot; are
                                decided after the fact in the Open Source
                                community, but they are rooted in conscious
                                decisions. No one said that Jim Fulton had
                                special authority over Nevow, Python web
                                programming, or anything -- the informal
                                authority he has was gained through his action
                                and involvement, and leveraging the authority
                                from a popular framework (Zope). And even in the
                                presence of Zope Corp, he still doesn't get a
                                pass when it comes to authority in that
                                community. &quot;Authority&quot; in all these
                                cases still only means that people choose to
                                listen to him, not that he can actually make
                                people do much (at least outside of Zope Corp).
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                In turn he chooses things consciously and
                                strategically. Many people in the community do
                                this -- they choose something, either to follow
                                the opinions of others, to start out on their
                                own, to become part of some project -- based on
                                conscious decisions that include their
                                <em>imagination</em> -- what they think
                                <em>will</em> happen with projects, how they
                                personally feel invested or alienated from a
                                project, how they imagine a design fitting into
                                their unknown future developments. Not all
                                programmers do this -- but almost all the ones
                                that <strong>matter</strong> do. Developer-users
                                -- people who just download packages and use
                                them in their isolated environments -- have very
                                little effect on the code or community.
                                Imaginative programmers are what make things
                                happen, and that's who I'm trying to appeal to
                                with most of what I write on this blog, because
                                sometimes code alone isn't enough to spark
                                someone's imagination. And sometimes I don't
                                have code to hawk anyway ;)
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                In conclusion, because I don't think I've made
                                my point entirely clear yet: on one level you
                                can look at the community and its decisions as
                                an organic process of evolution. And seeing that
                                you can think that conscious decisions and
                                strategies don't matter, that standards can't
                                mean much, that the best man will always win in
                                time. But the other side is that the community
                                is made up entirely of individuals -- it seems
                                organic because there are no authoritative
                                institutions, no authoritative decisions outside
                                of what an individual chooses for him or
                                herself. But individuals make decisions for very
                                conscious and personal reasons, and though it's
                                a different process to appeal to a community of
                                many individuals, it's still worth doing.

                    I have to agree. I have been through 3 generations of web
                    application development. Circa 1996 1st used Delphi to do
                    CGI programming on O'Reilly Website webserver (!). 2nd Circa
                    2000 Programmed Java servlets on Sun Javawebserver running
                    on Windows NT interacting with with Informix on HP-UX . 3rd
                    2003 to now PHP on linux/apache with Postgresql. Staying
                    there until something better...
                </p>
                <p>
                    PHP is pretty ragged sometimes but I have found that people
                    can become productive very quickly, there are lots of good
                    examples (or at least examples). I am leery of the move to
                    &quot;all objects&quot; php5. I have never seen anything
                    that was just impossible in PHP, and usually there is a
                    pre-existing built in function to use, or a PEAR class that
                    can be installed.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I like python a lot and have written extensively in it,
                    doing large Postgresql database load operations in large
                    scale conversions from legacy systems. At one point I was
                    convinced that it would be worth it to do web programming in
                    python but everything just seems to be so immature, and the
                    python web developer base is tiny.

                    Zope seems ridiculously complex, though it seems to be the
                    poster child for &quot;big time&quot; python success. And it
                    is slow, admit it. And given there are probably dozens of
                    good CMS's in PHP (mediawiki, mambo, drupal, etc) why not
                    skip it. Just because it's &quot;famous in Europe?&quot;
                    (like Slim Whitman?). I think Zope has enough momentum to
                    actually make a buck as a consultant if you get Zope
                    expertise but that is just a guess.

                    Twisted Matrix seems interesting but practical
                    examples/tutorials of significant production non-toy web
                    apps (e-commerce, CMS, business system/database apps etc.)
                    seem missing. &quot;It does everything and does it
                    fast&quot;, &quot;Write an http server in 2 lines!&quot; etc
                    sounds great but where are the real life examples?
                </p>
                <p>
                    I agree with earlier comment that requiring Apache 2 to run
                    latest mod_python is a drag for PHP users. I tried it but
                    compared to ease of development in apache anything and PHP
                    why bother.

                    I would not worry that much about Rails. Like the twisted
                    matrix crowd there is the tone of &quot;look everything is
                    easy!, a site built in 100 lines of code&quot; and again,
                    where are the real life, in use applications that I can
                    download and look at and which don't look like a high school
                    CS term project.

                    Anyhow, IMYO, too late for python to make a significant
                    impact for web development, the python news always seems to
                    be dominated by arcane and obscure discussions (i.e
                    decorators). IronPython may be the next big deal, but the
                    alliance with the dark forces of Microsoft and .Net will
                    alienate many.

                I also <em>totaly</em> agree. I ended up doing a big web project
                in php because it was too hard to do in zope (though we tried
                for 3 months) and mod_python was to difficult too use compared
                to php. I <em>really</em> wish that I had done it in python now,
                but, its too late for that. Now I have this giant beast, albeit
                written well, its written in a crappy language. If python were
                convenient to use on the web it would be a power house. I don't
                want to start flaming, but after using php for a few years I can
                confidently say its a mess, a real scritping language. I could
                almost write better scripts in bash ;) --not really. I'm
                starting a new project and looking at zope3, but I really wish
                python was as clean an easy as php, and had a tool-kit as smart
                as rails. Alas there is still hope! Let us unite and crush the
                competition, lest we be the beta-max of the web. Superior, but
                eventualy useless.

                    A quick search for &quot;webware&quot; in the comments came
                    up with nothing. I'm a web developer with a background in
                    cold fusion. I've been using python to code background tasks
                    like importing and exporting data and just about anything I
                    can think of. I recently I started playing with webware
                    because I want to see what python can do on the web. What is
                    everyone's comments on webware? Is it worth it's weight?
                </p>
                <p>
                    From the looks of it, a mixture of SQLObjects, Cheetah and
                    Webware would allow you to build a damn good/flexible webapp
                    in a couple hours.

                    , it's an application server in python that resembles
                    concepts in J2EE. Servlets, PSP, all that jazz. It's open
                    source too. Gotta love that. Thanks.

                            PHP is pretty ragged sometimes but I have found that
                            people can become productive very quickly, there are
                            lots of good examples (or at least examples). I am
                            leery of the move to &quot;all objects&quot; php5. I
                            have never seen anything that was just impossible in
                            PHP, and usually there is a pre-existing built in
                            function to use, or a PEAR class that can be
                            installed.

                    Ian, I completely agree with your analysis. I am not a
                    developper, rather a 'power user'. My first goal is to get
                    things done quickly and cleanly. I often use python for
                    different purposes and I have tried (at the tutorial level)
                    most of available python web frameworks.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I think we need a kind of easyPHP all-in-one package
                    (including python and a db) with a simple demo application
                    that you can immediately fire and which acts as the first
                    step by step tutorial.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I am not enough skilled to launch a new collaborative
                    project, but I will love to participate to one like this if
                    some python expert would accept to start and pilot the
                    project. I think python community should try to leverage the
                    huge base of good-but-not-experts programmers available
                    among its members to participate to projects like this. This
                    probably leads to invent a new kind of collaboration,
                    simpler to start with for newcomers. How to work with 20-30
                    good programmers who can provide a few hours of work per
                    week, instead of 4-5 experts much more involved.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If Python community would manage to invent this new
                    collaborative method, involving a lot of good pragmatic
                    developers (uninterested in overdesigning), I am convinced
                    that the new Python-for-web package would not need more than
                    a few months to emerge.
                </p>

                    Am I a poor lonesome-good-enough-but-not-expert python
                    programmer ?
                </p>
                <p>
                    If not, write down a line on this blog, and perhaps some
                    Python guru/leader will think it's a pity not to use such a
                    treasure of pragmatic and available task-force.

                    Simplicity is the key. Make testing changes as quick as
                    possible.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So far my python web development has been done with the cgi
                    module, zope, plone, twisted, simplehttpserver, mod_python,
                    and now lighttpd + wsgi. So like a lot of people I have
                    tried all sorts of things. I also use php, and a little java
                    on some projects(not ones I have started). Here is my brain
                    dump of where I am at, and what I'm doing with python web
                    dev stuff.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So far I think plone+zope is the most advanced, and popular
                    of all the python web development frameworks at the moment.
                    It is really simple to install and get a site up. It is
                    simple in some respects, if all you want is in the default
                    plone site. However making modifications to it requires a
                    lot of learning. It has sooo many users at the moment
                    compared to other frameworks, that it will eventually have
                    enough modifications available to do many common web tasks.
                    Also getting good performance out of plone is hard.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I like the subway effort. That's a really good idea, and I
                    wish them luck. Cheetah + SQLObject + WSCGI are pretty good
                    building blocks, and are some of the things I'm using on my
                    latest python web project. I want to see how they do
                    automatic reloading of templates.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Simple. Five lines or less to do hello world. Simple. Twenty
                    lines or less to do a CRUD application. Scalable. Should be
                    able to be moved to run on multiple servers easily. Default
                    config should handle lots of users.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Can any python framework get 'hello world' done in five
                    lines or less of explanation? What about a CRUD app in less
                    than 20 lines of explanation?
                </p>
                <p>
                    Archetypes is probably the only one I can think of that can
                    do a CRUD one quickly, and simply.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Here is a less than five line php hello world explanation.
                    It will work on most webservers around, so no need to
                    describe how to install php. Not describing how to install
                    php makes the explanation shorter than a python one would
                    be.
                </p>
                <ol class="arabic simple">
                    <li>open a new file in notepad/vi.</li>
                    <li>
                        write into it this text: &lt;?php echo 'hello world';
                        php?&gt;
                    </li>

                </ol>
                <p>
                    OR for unix shell users: echo &quot;&lt;? echo 'hello
                    world'; ?&gt;&quot; &gt; index.php
                </p>
                <p>That is simple.</p>
                <p>
                    Doing a CRUD application with the basic php libraries is
                    quite hard. There are <em>many</em> more frameworks in php
                    than there is in python.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I really like WSGI, and I will be using that for my new
                    stuff. With wide spread WSCGI support there should be able
                    to run those types of applications more easily without
                    having to do complicated install instructions. It should
                    make using these various python frameworks easier. Luckily I
                    don't have too much python code to convert on my latest
                    project.

                                I made a basic inheritence system for templates
                                on the file system. It checks to see if there is
                                a template for each content types insert,
                                update, and list things. Otherwise it uses the
                                default templates for these things. This is
                                nice, as the designers do not need to do up nice
                                looking interfaces for every object, and I can
                                prototype things really quickly without having
                                to make up html interfaces.

                <p>
                    I think lighttpd + fastcgi + python is an awesome
                    combination. Each user can have their python processes run
                    under their own userid. Then operating system security, and
                    resource constraints can actually be used! You should get
                    much better performance than apache + mod_php. You can have
                    processes running on multiple machines with load balancing
                    really easy to set up.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I tried using mod_python... but I prefer to have single, or
                    separate processes running which makes caching data easier.
                    Caching database connections, and other data is hard with
                    multithreads/multi processes used in mod_python.

                    Python has been fun for web dev :) Certainly heaps easier
                    than php. I can write a CRUD application in a few pages of
                    code(basically an SQLObject with some extra meta data in

                    this is different for most people. I mainly work with at max
                    four other programmers, and a few designers. Which is quite
                    different from one person doing the whole thing.

                <p>
                    Not many web apps use database, or OS security to its
                    fullest. Why should the appserver with a user logged in with
                    anonymous rights have the same permissions to the database
                    as an admin user logged into the app server. If you have
                    different appservers running for different users(app, db, os
                    users) then you can use those layers of security to protect
                    yourself better. The root/god/admin user for you app may
                    even be able to log into different computers than anonymous
                    users. If you have the app server for anonymous users
                    running with restricted OS, and database access then you can
                    provide different resource limits. Eg limiting the memory of
                    the user your anonymous appserver runs as, and limiting
                    their CPU use, their number of open files, number of open
                    sockets, firewall rules etc.

                        well tested outside of my Linux box, but that just takes
                        time). It doesn't support a whole lot of servers at this
                        point, but I just haven't put any effort into that yet
                        -- the WSGI part should make this easy, but easy enough
                        that it's not a Hard Problem so I feel find putting it
                        off ;)

                        The first tutorial uses Webware APIs and ZPT. The ZPT
                        library (ZPTKit) handles template reloading so that
                        works fine. WSGIKit itself has a system for restarting
                        the server when code is changed, so that handles other
                        files being edited.

                    It's been said in earlier comments but I think it's
                    important. If you're after mind-share you need an approach
                    that will work on commodity shared hosting. Even mod_python
                    is not widely installed by shared hosters.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The other thing that kills off any casual interest is the
                    dependency of so much Python produced web-related code on
                    use of a command line to run &quot;python setup.py
                    install&quot;. Shared hosting with command line access is
                    very much the exception.

                <p>interesting discussion.</p>
                <p>
                    i'm rather new to this web programming world, but i've spent
                    the better part of the last 6 months developing a web
                    application framework to build a commercial web app. a
                    considerable amount of time was spent considering the
                    existing open source solutions there were out there at the
                    time (i hate to reinvent the wheel). (FWIW, i ended up using
                    something very simple and nice called &quot;draco&quot; and
                    plugging SQLobject into it, and then writing custom code on
                    top of it.)
                </p>
                <p>
                    i think that there are no easy answers to the python web
                    programming issue. there are too many different pieces and
                    too many varying desires. it's a very exciting sphere. some
                    people what an object db backend (better conceptual mapping
                    to data structures), some people want SQL db backends
                    (solid, fast, tried tested and true). some people want to
                    use apache as a front-end server, some people want a single
                    running process (e.g. Zope). some people like a distributed
                    model of treatment (many childs running, e.g. mod_python),
                    some people like an event-based model (simpler, e.g.
                    twisted). some people want one thing to do it all (zope),
                    some people want to provide independent pluggeable pieces
                    (e.g. python webobjects). some like templates (zpt, etc.),
                    some don't (e.g. using stan directly to generate a tree).
                    some people like to write low-level unit tests (e.g. zope),
                    some people like to test from the browser's point-of-view
                    (e.g. using mechanize).
                </p>
                <p>lots of options. you want to get started in a few hours?</p>
                <p>
                    i haven't seen anything serious out there that allows you to
                    create a SERIOUS app in a few hours. sorry. it's either too
                    complicated, or there is something you have to fiddle with
                    to make it do what you want. i don't even believe it's
                    possible to do so. and it doesn't even matter. you can't do
                    this in a few hours if you're trying to solve a real complex
                    problem, with lots of customers banging on your app at the
                    same time (and you HAVE to simulate that). sure, you can
                    write a cool little happy demo in ruby-on-rails (or whatever
                    hello world comes with the python frameworks out there) but
                    writing a seriously complex app will ALWAYS require of you
                    that at some point you will be debugging some deep problem
                    down to the bare metal, some race condition, some
                    hard-to-find bug that'll suck an afternoon (or even
                    sometimes a couple of days). software is hard. the more
                    experience you acquire, the more you become aware of this.
                    it just won't go in any other way than getting hurt year and
                    year by the same tendencies to want go fast fast faster.
                    writing a serious product REQUIRES of you that you write a
                    lot of tests (or spend painful hours fixing bugs reported by
                    customers). this will seem a bit lame, but IMHO in a few
                    hours you barely have time to draw a couple of diagrams and
                    explicit the most important issues in a document. if you
                    have much development experience, you've been hurt in the
                    right places and you can sort-of &quot;foresee&quot; where
                    it's likely to hurt again. you walk about a little more
                    carefully. if you think that you can finish a
                    production-ready app in a few HOURS you're fooled. you've
                    got NOTHING. VALUE in software, real value, is acquired with
                    testing and with real usage from real customers, and years
                    of maintenance, not once you finished the code. once you're
                    code complete, you still have no value. you have a good
                    intentions and a first step. this is why there is still a
                    lot of COBOL code around. it's got great VALUE. it's
                    _working_ code. it solves _real_ problems.
                </p>
                <p>
                    this reminds me so much of OLE/COM. you had these macros
                    that were supposed to do all this magic CoCreate factory
                    stuff for you, but as SOON as you needed to move a little
                    bit away from what was intended, you had to write all this
                    goo by hand. same with the web programming frameworks: do
                    NOT judge it by its &quot;hello world&quot;. this is why i'm
                    not the least impressed with the ruby-on-rails demos i've
                    seen. all i saw was that doing the trivial thing is easy,
                    and it comes out of the box. can i really develop a large
                    serious app with it? (Maybe yes, maybe no. I still don't
                    know.)
                </p>
                <p>
                    so who cares if the newbies can't get in easily? who cares
                    if the &quot;hello world&quot; is nicer with ruby-on-rails?
                    who cares if there is nothing comparable in python? who
                    cares if PHP is attracting a lot of people?
                </p>
                <p>
                    in the end, if you're a hacker, you'll put the pieces that
                    you need together and you'll just make it work. you'll get
                    down to the bare metal and just f**ing fix it. because you
                    have to. put your hands in the grinder and the grease. i
                    truly wish that we had found the magic formula to make
                    software development easy for everyone but we're not there
                    yet. you still gotta do your homework, learn your data
                    structures and algorithms, and learn practical DIY skills.
                </p>
                <p>
                    and you know that even those writing PHP code today will
                    have to do that once their app becomes anything close to
                    serious. and they'll suffer. the grease pit of python is not
                    bad at all if you ask me. the C code embedding is super
                    nice, and the modules code is simple to understand, when you
                    have to go there. anyway, they'll eventually gain
                    experience. and they'll eventually look at it again and
                    recognize the elegance of Python and that in the end, it's
                    not that hard to pry all the pieces you need to make it
                    work, and it's worth the boot-up effort. those who don't get
                    it will keep suffering in their PHP world.
                </p>
                <p>
                    so how do we make Python more accessible to the web
                    programming world? the language already rocks. the libraries
                    are all there. all you have to do is provide one good
                    solution to get the newbies hooked up, and one good solution
                    that makes it easy to install as PHP. AFAI can see all that
                    is needed is easy deployment. what is the big deal? people
                    with serious intentions will get over the lack of quickstart
                    appeal.
                </p>

                        Smalltalk, etc. Those tools also generate these debates.

                    I DISagree with you, and most of the people that have made
                    comments here. I do not think that throwing vast amounts of
                    resources on improving Python Web programming is going to do
                    much more than make it adequate compared to the vast
                    competition out there.

                    I think we could carve out a better niche for Python by
                    making it <em>the</em> preferred language for scripting
                    applications. When software suppliers don't just do the
                    equivalent of packaging up their software for COM, but are
                    actually delivering functionality by extending their core
                    application using Python. For this to happen we need to
                    focus more on things like KDE/OpenOffice/Gnome/Mozilla/...
                    support.

                    I am not advocating abandoning WEB tools development in
                    Python, I'm just observing that there are a lot of
                    competitors there and whilst it is very important to show
                    that Python can work there too, I don't think we can ever
                    become the preferred language for web programming.

                        I agree that Python applications are a valuable space,
                        even as stand alone applications lose share to web
                        applications.

                    <p>
                        If you meant embedding Python in applications then look
                        to LUA's successes.

                        If you meant applications then look at the cross
                        platform problems with wxWindows (Microsoft-specific),
                        Qt (licensing issues), GTK (unMicrosoft-specific), and
                        so on. Similar issues didn't stop Java (AWT's, Swing,
                        and the unSun solutions). Or maybe they did, Java
                        applications are novelties, OpenOffice and Eclipse are
                        blimps.

                        My personal hope is that Parrot will be uncomplicated,
                        fast, scalable, and very friendly to Python, even on
                        Apache. Python on Parrot may attract those with the
                        skills and mindset necessary to implement the desired
                        Python modules.

                            But I have to take issue with the Qt licence jibe -
                            the GPL should surely be good enough for open source
                            applications, and if you're in the business of
                            writing closed source commercial software for sale,
                            but you can't make the money back to pay the
                            licensing fees for Qt, perhaps you ought to consider
                            another business model.

                            (As for Parrot, if it has finally moved off defining

                            Otherwise, I'm not holding out much hope for it, I'm

                                The posts in this thread indicate that people
                                understand the issues involved, what is required
                                to address the issues, and some are moving
                                forward as I type this post. Instead of helping
                                I will continue typing...

                                I should mention that these are all personal
                                choices, for personal reasons, for personal
                                projects. I'm not aware of any available Python
                                GUI wages.

                                With that in mind: I choose to avoid writing KDE
                                or GNOME specific applications. I don't keep up,
                                I'm tired of it, I don't care if D-BUS wins or
                                loses. Like Debian, GNOME seems to need more
                                bizarre life and less dusty dust. KDE needs more
                                speed. I prefer the GPL but will put up with the
                                Python license. I suspect OpenOffice is a dead
                                end but would be happy to be wrong. If the first
                                post had mentioned Firefox instead of Mozilla I
                                may have been more enthusiastic. Is it easier to
                                embed Python or Lua? I don't know but would
                                guess Lua wins (given its footprint and
                                popularity). Extending applications externally
                                begins to look like web services, which begins
                                to look like the original subject. :)

                                confusion, the markets. Qt license threads are
                                not new.

                                through hoops. But my personal choices weren't
                                the point of the quoted statement. The point was
                                that there is not a substantial Python answer to
                                the GUI question when the multiplatform planet
                                is asking (commercial, anti-fascist, and all the
                                rest). The planet sized version of the GUI
                                question begins to look like the web version of
                                the original subject too, and other languages
                                have better answers. My hope is that a personal
                                project might wag the long, killer app tail and
                                that perhaps others will react by cleaning up
                                the messes. If not, at least I am enjoying PyGTK
                                (except for the Menu parent/tearable/popup
                                breeding headaches).

                                certainly a valid choice that choice also
                                surrenders the benefit of network effects, the

                                I first became nervous when Ruby brought up
                                Visual Basic compatibility. Then Dan
                                disappeared. Maybe Parrot is a dead end. Sadly I
                                think the Python VM is too. So something needs
                                to come along, if not Parrot. Not that I care
                                all that much; I hold my personal language
                                choices close but am prepared to release them at

                            &lt;quote&gt;If you meant applications then look at
                            the cross platform problems with wxWindows
                            (Microsoft-specific), &lt;/quote&gt;
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            wxWindows is MS-specific, but wxGTK works fine for
                            me under Linux. Either way, wx has generally been my
                            GUI of choice. And, after reading this thread, I'm
                            going to re-think my stance on php. The pages I have
                            created with it are a mess.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            BTW, as far as the hosters go, I'd say there are
                            basically 4 levels of python support: 1. python's
                            installed and you can run CGI with it 2. mod_python
                            3. zope 4. plone
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I really should start evangelizing the joys of plone
                            to try to convince more hosts to offer it. Then
                            again, I'm not sure how hard it is to actually keep
                            it running. Having it on my development box at home
                            isn't really the same.

                        I disagree with you vigorously. Do we want to tread the
                        steps of such language titans as Tcl and Lua? Ha!
                        Scripting doesn't build community and doesn't build
                        participation, and that matters tremendously to an open
                        source project. Scripting isn't <em>bad</em> for the
                        language, it's just not very <em>good</em>. Honestly,
                        I've never usefully scripted any application with
                        Python, and I've only uselessly done it once or twice.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Also, the idea we can dominate that position is silly.
                        Anyone can create a language powerful enough for
                        &quot;scripting&quot;. And they do it all the time --
                        Lua, rep, JavaShell, yada yada. It's stiff competition
                        for a fairly pointless niche.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If you mean gluing together applications, yeah, okay...
                        but that's not even a niche, it's just an idea. And the
                        web has as much to do with that as anything.

                    To succeed in the web framework, Python will need to answer

                                    also do the dirty work of synching between
                                    local and remote servers.

                    I remember touching on this issue on Web-Sig last year.
                    Although I recall that you had some sympathy for my
                    position, others were far more interested in either trying
                    to emulate Java, or favouring framework developers over web
                    application developers (mainly because most people on the
                    list were framework developers). I still think WSGI solves
                    the wrong problem, and that its existence distracts from the
                    fact that Python could, and should, be a great alternative
                    to PHP or ASP, if the framework developers were willing to
                    work together to create something approaching a standard,
                    rather than offering a bewildering array of complex partial
                    solutions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Unfortunately this is just one of several problems holding
                    Python back. A similar situation applies to multimedia,
                    which Python doesn't support very well out of the box. I
                    find it bewildering that we have lexical analysis,
                    scheduling, and curses support as standard yet OpenGL
                    support has to be downloaded along with its dependencies.
                    Versioning issues (at least on Win32) are a significant
                    problem for me too - there are all these new features in
                    Python 2.4, yet I can't use it until the libraries I rely
                    upon are recompiled/repackaged for this version, which may
                    never happen. It is unfortunate that Python, despite being a
                    language that is incredibly convenient to use, does not have
                    the necessary structures in place to make its adoption
                    equally convenient.

                    You say that programmers like Python and thus it deserves to
                    do well in Web Programming space (or should do better
                    anyway)....
                </p>
                <p>
                    But programmers also apparently like Ruby quite a bit and it
                    IS doing well in the Web Programming space. So why does it
                    really matter which of the Object Oriented, dynamic
                    languages &quot;makes it&quot; in the web programming space?
                    Maybe Ruby is 'making it' there for some good reasons. You
                    often hear how similar the languages are, but really the
                    mindset does seem to be different between them. I suspect
                    that Ruby has something going for it that Python finds more
                    difficult.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Anyway, I repeat the question in another way: Why not cheer
                    Ruby along since it has most of the things you feel are
                    important (except for the whitespace-as-syntax which most of
                    us can live without anyway)?

                    <li>Why are we obsessed with Ruby on Rails?</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Ruby on Rails has made such a stir in the Python community
                    because of the hype and popularity of it. Those of us who
                    feel that Python is a superior language are kind of jealous
                    of the hype. Why not Python? Why not a Python based web
                    framework? Waaaaaa!
                </p>
                <p>
                    I've never used RoR, so I don't know whether I would like
                    doing web development in it. I suspect I would like some
                    aspects of it and not others (based on seeing Dave Thomas's
                    presentation in it at a conference I went to). I suspect
                    after the hype starts dying down, we'll get to hear about
                    RoR's drawbacks.
                </p>
                <ul class="simple">
                    <li>What makes up a good web framework?</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    I agree that a really good Pythonic web framework would be
                    neat. However different people have different ideas about
                    what makes up a good web framework. And I'm not sure what a
                    truly Pythonic framework would be like.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Personally I can't stand having code embedded with HTML.
                    Yuck-o! Usually when I work on a project the HTML is done
                    and redone by a graphic artisty person and I don't want code
                    in there for them to muck up. I don't want to have to
                    re-integrate code every time I get the HTML back. I want as
                    little code as possible in my HTML please. That is a huge
                    deal to me.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So things like Spyce and &lt;insert your templating language
                    of choice&gt; are not very appealing to me. Heck, why not
                    pure HTML with unique IDs on everything, and a parser that
                    compiles the HTML into Python with a way to access all the
                    ID'd HTML elements?
                </p>
                <ul class="simple">
                    <li>What about ASP.NET?</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    I am a fan of ASP.NET actually. Yeah, boo hiss I know. Evil
                    Microsoft, etc. I'm surprised someone hasn't developed
                    something similar to ASP.NET in Python (look at Tapestry for
                    Java and Prado for PHP). I don't think ASP.NET is perfect,
                    but I think it has some really kick butt ideas that take the
                    drudgery out of coding web forms and forms processing.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Server Controls are a great way to componentize HTML +
                    logic. User Controls are a great way to re-use forms and all
                    the form processing code. They aren't perfect, but they are
                    pretty darned good.
                </p>
                <ul class="simple">
                    <li>What about PHP?</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    I have used PHP off and on over the years. Its kind of the
                    lowest common denominator web development language. I'm not
                    a big fan. It is popular because it is really freaking
                    simple. You don't have to do any OO programming. You can
                    just start spewing out code. And much of what people write
                    in PHP is ugly spaghetti code. Forms processing is painful
                    and can quickly get out of hand. There is not a good way to
                    componentize form+logic.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If there were a Python framework that were as popular as
                    PHP, it would probably have similar limitations as PHP. It
                    would be too simple.
                </p>
                <ul class="simple">
                    <li>What about whitespace?</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    People are so weird about the whitespace issue in Python. It
                    is a huge turnoff to people. I know it discouraged me from
                    learning Python. Eventually I broke down and learned it
                    anyway.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The funny thing is - we all use whitespace to show program
                    structure in any programming language we use. Why do having
                    those curly braces make us feel so safe? Why does it feel so
                    dangerous to not use the curly braces? It is some bizarre
                    psychological issue that annoys programmers way more than it
                    should. Giving up the curly braces is scary.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Yet when you give them up, and get used to it, it seems so
                    silly that you so staunchly defended them in the first
                    place.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Dammit, we all use whitespace to denote structure anyway.
                    Give up the curly braces. They don't matter. Really. Trust
                    me. Seriously.
                </p>
                <ul class="simple">
                    <li>Conclusion</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    So where does that leave us? Python has what..200 different
                    web frameworks? And there are probably 20 more in
                    development at any one time? Well, maybe not, but it seems
                    like it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    What puzzles me is that many of these frameworks seem to be
                    solving pretty much the same problems. So they seem fairly
                    interchangeable to me. The truly innovatives ones are few
                    and far between.
                </p>
                <p>
                    People have different ideas of what they want a web
                    framework to be. People have different requirements.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I don't care about whether my Python framework is supported
                    by an ISP. I am never using a hosting account. So that is
                    never a big deal to me. I've got root on whatever box is
                    going to be my server. So I can install whatever I need to.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I've not seen a Python web framework that feels good to me.
                    Maybe I just haven't looked hard enough at the ones out
                    there now. It takes time to sit down and start playing with
                    a new framework and seeing what it is really like to develop
                    with. You pretty much have to commit to doing some kind of
                    project in the framework to really get a feel for what it is
                    like.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Are there people out there working on an innovative Pythonic
                    (whatever that means) framework that isn't just a reaction
                    to RoR or PHP? Is there a component and event based Python
                    web framework out there?

                <p>&gt; Python could have been PHP</p>
                <p>
                    I disagree. I think PHP is the visual basic analog. It
                    allows people who don't have an incredible amount of energy
                    to invest in the field to get a measure of success quickly.
                    It will give you some measure of functional success for a
                    time but doesn't allow experienced people the flexibility to
                    flex their might that experienced people in better platforms
                    have.

                        Agree, although &quot;some measure of functional
                        success&quot; is an understatement in my opinion. You
                        are not going to get the most efficient and powerful
                        programs out of Visual Basic or PHP, but rather tons of
                        useful applications of lesser status in a short period
                        of time. While the former is crucial and glamorous, the
                        later is just as important to say the least. Take the
                        world we live in--almost all state-of-the-art products
                        we see on newspapers will not see common usage until
                        years later, and by the time they do they will certainly
                        be considered outdated. Will we say the appliances we
                        use everyday as less important just because they are not
                        state-of-the-art? On the other hand, the fact that
                        state-of-the-art products are not popular does not make
                        them any less important.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This ties back to where Python should head. A good and
                        important programming language need not be popular, just
                        as popular and important languages need not be good
                        ones. How important is being popular? For mass
                        appeal--if that is the way to go--Python has to be
                        <em>easy to use</em>. That includes better
                        documentation, more support from hosting solutions and
                        crucially sacrifice in times &quot;the right way to do
                        things&quot;. If in the worst scenario Python goes down
                        to history as a good, important but not popular
                        language, is that something for us to regret? I am not
                        saying that nothing should be done, but just that
                        popularity should not be seen as essential.
