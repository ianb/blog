                As long as I'm talking about
                <a class="reference" href="where-next-for-formencode.html"
                    >FormEncode</a
                >, I thought I'd mention
                <a
                    class="reference"
                    href="http://svn.colorstudy.com/trunk/Validator/validator/htmlfill.py"
                    >htmlfill</a
                >. <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">htmlfill</span></tt> is
                an anti-form-generator; it doesn't generate forms at all, but
                given a bunch of default values and potentially some errors,
                it'll fill in all the
                <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">value</span></tt>
                attributes in your form. This way you can design the form
                however you want, rearrange things in whatever order, without
                worrying about form generation rules.
            </p>
            <p>
                Automatically-generated forms seem cool, especially to
                programmers, but they don't really work for many public forms,
                and even for backend administration forms they feel more
                transitional than essential. Form generators have a terribly
                time with small exceptions, but small exceptions are the stuff
                that brings polish to a product, and I don't like putting up a
                barrier to small tweaks. So I'm inclined towards this technique,
                given a knowledge of HTML that allows me to fill a form without
                special templating instructions.
            </p>
            <p>
                The module doesn't have any dependencies outside of the standard
                library.

print parser.text()
</pre
                    >
                    <p>
                        Output (well, slightly reformatted, since it eats
                        newlines right now for some reason):
                    </p>
                    <pre class="literal-block">
&lt;form action=&quot;&quot;&gt;

</pre

                    <p>
                        The errors are formatted using
                        <tt class="literal"
                            ><span class="pre"

                            ></tt
                        >, or you can use
                        <tt class="literal"
                            ><span class="pre"
                                >format=&quot;formatter_name&quot;</span
                            ></tt
                        >
                        to specify your custom formatter. I'd like to include
                        errors by default (if you don't include a specific
                        <tt class="literal"
                            ><span class="pre">&lt;form:error&gt;</span></tt
                        >
                        tag), but I haven't figured out how to do that properly;
                        you'd have to double-parse the form, to check which
                        errors were left unused. For now it (optionally) gives
                        you an exception if you include an error without a
                        corresponding
                        <tt class="literal"
                            ><span class="pre">&lt;form:error&gt;</span></tt
                        >
                        tag, but this has been problematic.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You can also use
                        <tt class="literal"
                            ><span class="pre">&lt;form:iferror</span>
                            <span class="pre"
                                >name=&quot;field_name&quot;&gt;</span
                            ></tt
                        >
                        to conditionally include text, in case you need to put a
                        <tt class="literal"
                            ><span class="pre">&lt;br&gt;</span></tt
                        >
                        or somesuch into the markup only if you have an error.
                        But for the most part
                        <tt class="literal"
                            ><span class="pre">default_formatter</span></tt
                        >
                        (or your custom formatter) is an easier way to put in
                        such tags.

                    I think the nicest part of form generators is automatic
                    generation of widgets (form controls), which IMHO often have
                    much of business logic that shouldn't be putted into HTML
                    (template), things like size, maxlength etc. Another problem
                    are more advanced / combined widgets (date widget, for
                    example), which require lot's of javascript - I don't want
                    to code them over and over again in every template.
                </p>
                <p>
                    But I agree that the rendering of the form itself needs more
                    freedom - order of the widgets, two widgets on the same line
                    etc. Currently I use Quixote form package with HTMLTemplate
                    (<a
                        class="reference"
                        href="http://freespace.virgin.net/hamish.sanderson/htmltemplate.html"

                    >), and have the best of both worlds, IMHO :)

                        Data-driven Javascript is reasonably easy to use with
                        these techniques; in that model, the Javascript reads
                        and writes to a normal input element (maybe hidden), and
                        is set up separately from the tag. For example, I've
                        used htmlfill with
                        <a
                            class="reference"
                            href="http://www.dynarch.com/projects/calendar/"
                            >jscalendar</a
                        >
                        with no problem. That kind of Javascript is generally
                        accessible to non-Javascript-supporting browsers too, so
                        it's a good feature anyway.

                            Yes, I see.... Also sorry for the last comment, I
                            didn't notice that input attributes (size, maxlength
                            etc.) can be passed with add_attributes. I think
                            htmlfill is very usefull right now, but just out of
                            curiosity: do you think it needs some extra
                            functionality? Do you miss something in htmlfill
                            already? :)

                                Missing... well, there's the automatic error
                                insertion, which I noted before. It would also
                                be nice if there was a purely information
                                parsing option. Like, you'd be able to put an
                                attribute in like
                                <tt class="docutils literal"

                                and then parse that out of the form and create a
                                validation schema from that (using whatever
                                validation system you chose). When actually
                                rendering the form, all those attributes would
                                be removed. I think that's mostly it.
