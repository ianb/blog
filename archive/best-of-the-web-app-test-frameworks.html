</div><h1>Best of the web app test frameworks?</h1>
 
<div class="document">
<p>What are the best web application test frameworks people have seen?
Any language, though I'm thinking more about unit tests, not as much
about through-HTTP acceptance testing.</p>
<p>I'm curious mostly because I want to see other useful features for me
to borrow.  Right now the <a class="reference" href="http://pythonpaste.org/testing-applications.html">test framework in Paste</a> is pretty simple,
but IMHO in a good way.</p>
<p>There's some other features I've seen that I'm unsure of.  For
instance, the <a class="reference" href="http://ibofobi.dk/blog/archive/2005/11/08/django-doctest/">ibofobi framework for Django</a> uses
<a class="reference" href="http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/">Beautiful Soup</a> for
extracting response strings for testing.  Do people think this is
useful?  Personally I'm happy enough testing for the simple existence
of strings, without caring about where in the structure of the
document they appear.  Also it works better for negative assertions,
i.e., asserting that a string doesn't appear <em>anywhere</em> in the
document; I do a lot of these in my tests.</p>
<p>Also, what do people think about <a class="reference" href="http://python.org/doc/current/lib/module-doctest.html">doctest</a> in this
context?  I started out using that, but ended up reverting to <a class="reference" href="http://codespeak.net/py/current/doc/test.html">py.test</a> because my tests
quickly became more complicated than doctest could really handle
elegantly.  Doctest still <em>worked</em>, I just wasn't using any of the
features that make it convenient (and I was missing the py.test
features).  Note that <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">paste.fixture</span></tt> doesn't really <em>require</em>
py.test, since py.test is a kind of null framework; I just don't go
out of my way to add any special unittest hooks (like, say, a custom
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">TestCase</span></tt> subclass).</p>
<p>I haven't looked closely at <a class="reference" href="http://www.idyll.org/~t/www-tools/twill.html">Twill</a> since shortly after
it split from PBP.  I like in-process tests a lot, so Twill doesn't
really test in the way I'd want it to.  Though I bet I could tweak it
to test in-process too... anyway, a feature it has is how it fills in forms nicely.  I
just added <a class="reference" href="http://pythonpaste.org/testing-applications.html#id1">form filling to Paste</a>, but it's
very rough still.  And I feel bad that I'm using regexes and not
<a class="reference" href="http://wwwsearch.sourceforge.net/mechanize/">Mechanize</a> or
something similar.  One thing Paste can do is require reasonably well-formed
markup, because it's not intended for testng applications you can't control
(but I'm not willing to require XHTML, just reasonably unambiguous HTML 4).</p>
<p>Zope 3 emphasizes testing, but I have to admit that I am unimpressed
by the <a class="reference" href="http://www.zope.org/Wikis/DevSite/Projects/ComponentArchitecture/Zope3Book/ftests.html">functional testing</a>
(and <a class="reference" href="http://www.zope.org/Wikis/DevSite/Projects/ComponentArchitecture/Zope3Book/fdoctests.html">doctest functional testing</a>)
there.  It seems long-winded.  There might also be better systems
people have set up there.  Paste creates a wrapper around the
&quot;application,&quot; which seems much better than the kind of manual request
setup I see for many frameworks (like in <a class="reference" href="http://turbogears.org/docs/testing.html">TurboGears</a>).</p>
<p>One thing I've done in <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">paste.fixture</span></tt> is to expect success unless
told otherwise.  So you don't confirm a request returned a 200 status
code -- it's an error if it doesn't, unless you explicitly say you
expect something else.  I think explicitly checking for a 200 status
code is crazy.</p>
<p>What about patterns for matching markup?  I test strings against a
normalized form of the page (mostly whitespace normalized), but
sometimes you do want to test the structure, and I want to avoid fragile
tests that test for more than they should (and will fail, for example,
due to small design changes).  Regular expressions
aren't good here; instead it's good to have something that knows about
the structure of markup, knows to ignore attribute order, knows when
to ignore whitespace (and where not to), etc.  I've <a class="reference" href="http://svn.colorstudy.com/FormEncode/trunk/formencode/doctest_xml_compare.py">played with this
before</a>,
but I'd be very happy if there was someone else's code I could use here.</p>

<p>I have, and we'll probably use it on some level, but it doesn't really apply to unit-style testing, or even what I would classify as functional testing.  It's much more about acceptance and regression testing.  I find the tests too verbose to write by hand; there's a nice Firefox extension for recording, but you can only record after the application is written.</p>

<p>i still use py.test for most of my testing but for acceptance testing of web apps, Selenium has proven itself extremely useful. there's something extremely comforting about seeing that everything works together from end to end all the way to the browser.</p>

<p>That project has an awesome schematic!  It seems like an interesting project, and after playing around with several recorders the translation seems very reasonable -- capturing higher-level information than just HTTP requests is useful, and best done at a browser level, but it doesn't need to be that closely attached to the target test framework.</p>
<p>However, like I mentioned in the Selenium comment, this doesn't really feel right for unit testing IMHO, and certainly doesn't work well for TDD.</p>

<pre class="literal-block">
Zope 3 emphasizes testing, but I have to admit that I am unimpressed by the functional testing
</pre>
<p>Zope 3.2 will include zope.testbrowser which is a much nicer way to do functional tests.  See <a class="reference" href="http://svn.zope.org/Zope3/trunk/src/zope/testbrowser/README.txt?rev=40035&amp;view=markup">http://svn.zope.org/Zope3/trunk/src/zope/testbrowser/README.txt?rev=40035&amp;view=markup</a> for example usage.</p>
<p>It is also usable outside of Zope, and I hope on packaging up a stand-alone version around the time 3.2 is released (December).  If I get time I'd also like to do a WSGI version.</p>

<p>Yes, that's much better indeed.  Now I can't remember quite why I wrapped my application in an object, instead of using a browser object as the central metaphor.  In the end it's not that much different, except that some things like &quot;back&quot; don't exist for an application, and it's not as stateful (which has pluses and minuses).</p>
<p>It looks like zope.browser actually uses HTTP requests?  WSGI would definitely be nice, as it would allow in-process requests, something that I have found very convenient.  Seeing the framework's nice-formatted HTTP exception reports is not particularly useful when you are running automated tests.  I also like that I can send out-of-band information; for instance, I use REMOTE_USER to set the username (or sometimes put it in test-specific configuration), instead of simulating a full login.  Then I don't need fake logins, or to put my password in the tests, etc.</p>
<p>Another feature that I added to paste.fixture -- in part after looking at Rails' and CherryPy's tests -- is the <a class="reference" href="http://pythonpaste.org/testing-applications.html#framework-hooks">framework hooks</a> which allow frameworks to record internal information into the response object.  This means you can simultaneously test the full-stack rendering and response, and internal details like what variables were passed to the template.  Obviously you can only do this in-process.</p>

</pre>
<p>For Zope 3 it directly communicates with the in-process publisher.  Not only is it much faster that way, you can have non-testbrowser code do other types of tests (as you mention below).  There's also a generic browser object you can use that makes connections over the wire for testing &quot;remote&quot; applications or doing non-testing tasks.</p>
<p>I intend on integrating the same way with WSGI; zope.testbrowser would actually be a WSGI server into which you would plug the application(s) under test.</p>
<p>Of course this fits into my desire to make Zope 3 paste.deploy compatible.</p>

<p>A couple quick comments re testing &amp; twill.</p>
<p>I'm starting to use 'nose' for unit testing, and it's great.</p>
<p>In conjunction with my 'nose' unit tests, I've also just added a fairly simple interface for specifying (a) an app to run and (b) a twill script to use to test that app.  Watch planetpython for my blog post on that.</p>
<p>The maxq recorder for twill sucks.  Or should that be Sucks?  I'm hoping to get some work done on it soon, but right now it's not terribly useful.  (Ironic, given that one of the reasons I wrote twill was so that I could play back recorded tests.)</p>
<p>I'm intrigued by John's opinion of zope.testbrowser.  I liked the look of it too, but it'd be a big change for twill and I'm not feeling that energetic right now ;).</p>
<p>Why not define a new URI scheme, e.g. 'wsgi://', and then put in a urllib2-like WsgiHandler or some such?  That could potentially be a simpler way to do &quot;in process&quot; tests than monkeypatching urllib... either way, I like the idea of getting twill/mechanize/* to talk to things without going through HTTP.</p>
<p>John -- I promise I'll start using the new mechanize code soon ;).  Right now I'm a bit overwhelmed, but it's on my TODO list.</p>

<p>At the risk of repeating myself, no monkeypatching is required to add wsgi: URL support -- urllib2 is designed so that adding new URL schemes and behaviour is easy iff you have access to the OpenerDirector instance (the thing you call .open(urlOrRequest) on).

<p>This is a good direction for twill, IMO, so I'm moderately enthusiastic about implementing it, too.</p>

<p>zope.testbrowser looks nice, but it's unclear to me what the compelling advantage is.  I've got to look at it more before

<p>the twill API doesn't provide direct access to anything mechanize-tic, but the full mechanize interface is of course accessible to extension functions,

<p>Why invent the 'wsgi:' scheme, when you can just reimplement urllib2.HTTPHandler?</p>

<p>When I wrote my webapp framework last year, I too found that Zope testing was inadequate, and I still do.  I ended up writing my own app end-to-end (I could not bear without an autoreload feature for the source code, and all Zope3 facilities for fast development were broken, couldn't use webdav to upload files, had to restart server on every change, there was no way I was going to work like that), and using mechanize for testing it.  IMO best testing for the web should be done from a browser's perspective to really be effective.  I have found so many problems that would have slipped by without my tests.</p>
<p>One useful idea that I introduced in my app was to return custom meta fields in the head, that reflect some of the internal state of the server app, for example, the currently logged in user, and a return status string.  These only show up when the app is in debug mode, and the tests assert that the return statii are what is expected.</p>
<p>Another idea was to add extra test resources/pages in debug mode.  For example, when my app sends email to other users, well, in debug mode, it doesn't really send, rather, it puts the emails in a DB table (only the last email for each user) and then the tests can recuperate the last email sent for a particular user, whose contents it then validates.  I can parse the email to get some links with tokens, etc.  Just trying to do as close to the real processes as possible.</p>
<p>cheers,</p>

<p>paste.fixture does both of these:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>There's a special key for putting values for use in tests (<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">paste.testing_variables</span></tt>), which takes the place of headers.  It's out-of-band with respect to any HTTP information, and values needn't be serialized to strings.</li>
<li>There's also ways to detect when you are in a debugging environment (<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">paste.testing</span></tt>) -- some people think this is really bad, but I think those people are just scarred from having someone abuse that feature to put workarounds in the code for the tests.  The rule of consenting adults say, to me, that the variable belongs there.  Though, I suppose, those people want to set up all the mock objects ahead of time using a complicated setup process (e.g., dependency injection).  A boolean is easier.</li>

<p>I have been playing around with Turbo Gears and the first thing I wanted to do from the begining was write web tests. TurboGears testing simillar to Paste. However the one thing I missed alot was testing forms, this is usually what I want to test in my webpages.</p>
<p>Also, if you give some semantics to your html, like use classes you can extract more data out of it and, with the aid of BeautifulSoup, match the number of, let's say divs with the class 'product_entry' exist in the page and compare it with your model representation.</p>
<p>Here are the posts I wrote about the functions I mentioned:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Post 1: <a class="reference" href="http://s1x.homelinux.net/node/150">http://s1x.homelinux.net/node/150</a> talks about <cite>form_fill</cite>, <cite>form_to_dict</cite> and <cite>browse_url</cite></li>

<p>Web surfing is fun, but many tasks are repetitious: Checking on the same sites everyday, remembering passwords, submitting to search engines or testing web sites over and over again. With iMacros you record these tasks once and then let the iMacros software execute them whenever you need them.
Any combination of browsing, form filling, clicking and information gathering can be recorded into a macro and the iMacros software assists you during the recording with visual feedback.
Do you need to extract price lists, stock information or any other data from websites?</p>
<p>iOpus Internet Macros can help you:
