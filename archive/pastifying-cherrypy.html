                After
                <a
                    class="reference"
                    href="http://groups.google.com/group/turbogears/browse_thread/thread/c2033d1b4afb9ef1/5d41390b6347ecf0"
                    >some discussion</a
                >
                on the TurboGears list about Paste, I started looking more
                closely into what it will take to get CherryPy to work with
                Paste. I had
                <a class="reference" href="http://www.cherrypy.org/ticket/145"
                    >written a ticket</a
                >
                on the matter some time ago, but progress there was slow, and it
                wasn't clear any resolution was going to come about anyway.
            </p>
            <p>
                Ultimately I decided I could do it myself, even if I had to work
                against the CherryPy code a little bit, using threadlocal
                storage and some monkeypatching to make every CherryPy
                application think it was the root, and keep all the applications
                isolated and relocatable, as Paste wants them to be. I didn't
                read
                <a
                    class="reference"
                    href="http://www.defuze.org/oss/cpirc/%23cherrypy.2006-01-11.log.html#t2006-01-11T20:01:03"
                    >this discussion</a
                >
                until I was well into the project, but that's probably just as
                well; the CherryPy developer there doesn't think threadlocal
                will work, but really we're coming at it from different
                directions; I just want <em>one</em> good API, I don't need for
                it to be the only API in CherryPy (I understand that they have
                to provide backward compatibility), and I don't need
                <em>every</em> CherryPy application to work, just the ones that
                do the Right Thing (where the Right Thing is still somewhat to
                be determined).
            </p>
            <p>
                Anyway, the result is
                <a class="reference" href="http://pythonpaste.org/cherrypaste/"
                    >CherryPaste</a
                >. With it you can write a config file like:
            </p>
            <pre class="literal-block">
[app:main]
use = egg:CherryPaste
root_object = mypackage.rootobj:root

[server:main]
use = egg:Paste#http
</pre
            >
            <p>
                And then serve that up with
                <tt class="docutils literal"
                    ><span class="pre">paster</span>
                    <span class="pre">serve</span>
                    <span class="pre">config.ini</span></tt
                >, as well as using that to potentially run multiple instances
                of the same app under different paths, or behind authentication,
                or with the Ajax debugger in Paste, or what-have-you. I don't
                have a lot of concrete experience with CherryPy and haven't
                tried this on many (well, any) large CherryPy applications, but
                I welcome feedback and experience reports, and hopefully some of
                the inevitable kinks can be worked out.
            </p>
            <p>
                One of the misunderstandings that came up in the IRC discussion
                is about control. Part of the difficulty of CherryPaste is that
                CherryPy expects to have control of the process, and expects all
                CherryPy applications to register themselves centrally. So, why
                should CherryPy support Paste, isn't that just Paste saying that
                <em>it</em> should be at the top, that <em>it</em> is the more
                fundamental or proper abstraction?
            </p>
            <p>
                No, that's not it at all. To work with Paste, an application or
                framework has to be well encapsulated. It has to be in its own
                package, it has to have an identifiable entry point, it has to
                have a clear concept of configuration. Then Paste can work with
                it. But Paste does not want to <em>own</em> the application
                (except perhaps at runtime, if it has been so configured). If
                the application provides a function supporting the
                <a
                    class="reference"
                    href="http://pythonpaste.org/deploy/#paste-app-factory"
                    >paste.app_factory</a
                >
                API, it doesn't have to do so exclusively. The application
                doesn't have to make Paste a requirement, and probably doesn't
                have to import anything from Paste.
            </p>
            <p>
                So no, it's not that Paste wants to wrest control from CherryPy,
                it just needs CherryPy apps to have a clear boundary and not to
                demand control.
            </p>
            <p>
                Next up... I'm not sure... create a similar Paste adaptation of
                <a
                    class="reference"
                    href="http://projects.edgewall.com/trac/ticket/2581"
                    >Trac</a
                >
                (where I could use it to experiment with
                <a class="reference" href="paste-app-installation.html"
                    >installation</a
                >) or
                <a class="reference" href="http://www.djangoproject.com/"
                    >Django</a
                >
                (which would be more like CherryPaste, but probably requiring
                less cleverness)?

                    Yep, and while WSGI doesn't explicitly forbid them doing
                    that, it is a rather problematic design flaw from an
                    interoperability perspective. It prevents a web server from
                    deploying independent CherryPy-based applications in the
                    same process at user-defined locations, on different ports,
                    etc. It also makes applying middleware extremely complex.
                    The only reason WSGI <em>doesn't</em> warn against such
                    bizarre behavior is that it never occurred to me that
                    anybody would make a framework with such a peculiar
                    limitation; had I known that it existed, I'd have included
                    <strong>should</strong> statements to cover it. (E.g.,
                    &quot;a framework or application
                    <strong>should</strong> support creation of independent
                    application objects for use within a given process, to allow
                    deployers to serve multiple instances from the same process,
                    even if single-threaded. Applications
                    <strong>should not</strong> use global variables whose state
                    is maintained across requests, since this would interfere
                    with creation of multiple application instances.&quot;)

                    I would like to see Django. I am not sure of all of the
                    advantages of Paste yet. Still, maybe I will once I want to
                    use more than one web-framework. Although, for now, it looks
                    though Django will cover my bases.

                        A web framework is simply inappropriate for some kinds
                        of applications, like a WebDAV server, so I think it is
