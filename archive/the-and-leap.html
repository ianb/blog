            </p>
            <p>
                My skepticism is because Raskin seems to be really

                (and everything I read by or about him seems to reinforce this
                impression). That annoys me. When I read through the

                speak of him quite fondly.) But this all probably isn't fair,
                I'm sure he is a very smart guy.
            </p>
            <p>
                Anyway, one big idea for Raskin seems to be LEAP, which shows up
                even in the early history of the Macintosh. LEAP is the idea of
                having a special meta key, that acts similar to a shift key.
                When you want to type in a command, you hit the LEAP key and
                start typing the command (all commands are named) -- when you
                release the LEAP key the command is run. It's THE's answer to
                Emacs' M-x. The standard line is that it's really great, but
                without the right keyboard it doesn't work well -- the
                <em>right</em> keyboard would I think have a key below the
                space, so you can hit LEAP with your thumb and keep typing.
            </p>
            <p>
                Personally, I think it's really stupid. Like, ruins-a-good-idea
                stupid, because it's just <em>too hard</em> to type like that.
                The benefit of LEAP is based on this theory of minimalizing
                keystrokes -- specifically counting each key when it is pressed
                and release -- but even that doesn't add up, in part because it
                doesn't acknowledge that chords (more than one key at a time)
                are harder than single keys, and extended chords (holding one
                key while typing several others) are <em>much</em> harder. With
                a simple chord you can arrange your hands properly for that
                combination -- e.g., right pinky hitting shift, left hand
                hitting T -- but you can't do that for an extended chord.
            </p>
            <p>
                And what do you buy? The only thing you buy is
                <em>one keystroke</em>. Counting up and down strokes make no
                difference! Every key you hit you'll eventually release. Using a
                modal selection -- one where you hit a key and enter a new mode,
                type your command, then signal that the command is done -- takes
                only one more keystroke, the keystroke that says you're done
                (e.g., enter). I think it's mostly modal paranoia, the idea that
                <em>any</em> mode is bad, which is just silly in my mind.
            </p>
            <p>
                Also LEAP is Raskin's one clear invention, the one thing that he
                <em>owns</em> (literally, since he has a patent). So it just
                <em>has</em> to go in there.
            </p>
            <p>
                The other related theory in THE is that there's no keyboard
                shortcuts, you type every command out. (Actually, I believe
                there is <em>one</em> shortcut, equivalent to C-s in Emacs,
                which is important because you use incremental search for all
                navigation instead of arrow keys! I like incremental search a
                lot, but not <em>that</em> much!) I'll let you judge the wisdom
                of that on your own.
            </p>
            <p>
                Oh well. I wouldn't care so much if I didn't otherwise really
                like the ideas. I'll try to write a positive article next.

                    on the Mac. My &quot;LEAP&quot; key is command-space. I hit
                    that key combo, type in a command (with incremental search
                    on the results and a learning algorithm) and hit return to
                    run the command. I can even make advanced command selections
                    using arrow keys and tab to further refine or enhance the
                    action I have selected. I can be in the middle of one app,
                    and with a few keystrokes append a note into a text file and
                    pop back without evern needing to lift my hands from the
                    keyboard.

                        There is some distinction in that THE commands are much
                        more granular than Quicksilver commands -- basically
                        every command that is available, things like
                        &quot;save&quot; and &quot;next page&quot;. Of course
                        part of the idea of THE is that there's no fundamental

                        larger commands.

                    LEAP is not about counting the key strokes but about modes.
                    I am not sure the LEAP key can leap us from all the modes,
                    and for sure it will be very awkward to type when keeping to
                    press it, but the argument against modes is quite strong.

                    Talking about other his ideas - I like the Zoom Interface
                    very much, but I am sure they need to think up a way to add
                    links to it. The way we connect things one to another does
                    not allways look good as a planar graph.

                        Well, no, it's not, actually, though the dogma certainly
                        is -- statements of the above form are paradigmatic of
                        dogmatism. Paraphrasing, &quot;sure we put you through
                        ergonomic hell, but we have a good theoretical basis for
                        doing so&quot;.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        There are good ways to do modes and bad ways to do
                        modes, and LEAP is the very worst way -- it has two
                        modes, the &quot;LEAP key is up&quot; mode and the
                        &quot;LEAP key is down&quot; mode; denying that these
                        are modes is pure sophistry, since they affect the
                        meaning of keystrokes just like any of form of mode
                        specification. But &quot;LEAP key is down&quot; requires
                        the user to enter a different personal physical mode --
                        one that is in fact very limiting and demanding. This
                        makes LEAP an ergonomic disaster.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        emacs does modes right. modes are attached to buffers --
                        different logical spaces. There's never any question
                        what mode you're in, since you have both a different
                        conceptual/logical space -- you're operating on some
                        specific buffer -- and an explicit message on the screen
                        indicating what mode (actually modes, a major mode and 0
                        or more minor modes) are in effect in that buffer. There
                        are many different possible modes, which is a very good
                        thing in terms of functionality and usability. Raskin
                        would perhaps put several dozen different &quot;hold
                        this key down while ...&quot; keys on the keyboard, or
                        more likely simply not provide the functionality while
                        providing a dogmatic claim as to why that's a good
                        thing. Meanwhile, emacs users get work done,
                        pleasurably.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A special case of emacs moding, which isn't referred to
                        as such, is the minibuffer. In order to search or to
                        enter a command or to find a file or to do almost
                        anything where the entered text has semantic meaning to
                        emacs, you type an appropriate control key or sequence
                        which enters you into the minibuffer, with an explicit
                        message at the front of the minibuffer indicating what
                        sort of information you are entering. The key sequence
                        that puts you in the minibuffer of course is putting you
                        into a mode, but that mode is conceptually isolated by
                        transferring the cursor to a special place that is
                        clearly marked. It so happens that, since the minibuffer
                        is a buffer, you can switch from the minibuffer to any
                        other buffer -- the buffer switching key
                        <em>isn't moded</em> -- and then you're in the mode of
                        the buffer you have switched to, where you are free to
                        continue typing, but most likely you have switched to
                        that buffer to select text that you wish to enter into
                        the minibuffer -- text to search for, text that's a
                        command invocation or part of one, text that's a file to
                        open, etc. Try doing that with your finger holding down
                        the LEAP key, hah hah -- so much for modelessness. emacs
                        in fact gives you modelessness in the way it counts --
                        by being able to switch from mode to mode at will,
                        <em>without destroying the moded space</em>. This is
                        exactly equivalent to non-modal popups, which allow you
                        to continue to look at and even perform operations in
                        the windows they cover. We all know how badly modal
                        windows suck -- we shouldn't be trying to recreate that
                        experience in an editor.

                        The emacs mode model works, and it works very well,
                        which is a very strong refutation of the a priori claim
                        that there are strong arguments against it.

                    LEAP is actually C-s. You type &quot;[LEAP key down] f o o
                    [LEAP key up]&quot; to do the equivalent of &quot;C-s f o o
                    [RET]&quot; in Emacs. That's why it's called LEAP. It lets
                    you LEAP to another part of the document. I don't remember
                    how commands other than LEAP work in THE.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The rationale for it is not <em>just</em> the
                    saving-half-a-keystroke thing, it's also that it reduces the
                    problems of modes; since you have to hold down the LEAP key
                    to use it, you can't possibly forget that you're in search
                    mode rather than edit mode.

                    But I agree totally about the crack-smoking-ness of it
                    physically. My carpal tunnels would explode before the end
                    of the first week.
