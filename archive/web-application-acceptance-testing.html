                Grig Gheorghiu wrote up a description of using
                <a class="reference" href="http://maxq.tigris.org/">MaxQ</a> to
                test web pages in
                <a
                    class="reference"
                    href="http://agiletesting.blogspot.com/2005/02/web-app-testing-with-python-part-1.html"
                    >Web app testing with Python part 1: MaxQ</a
                >. I've recently been looking into web acceptance testing for my
                job, though my progress has stopped as I've been distracted with
                other things for a while.
            </p>
            <p>
                I haven't actually used MaxQ -- mostly because I find it hard to
                set up Java programs on my development systems. Sun's unfriendly
                attitude towards Free systems is incredibly stupid and shitty,
                but I digress...
            </p>
            <p>
                Anyway, I also came upon MaxQ from
                <a
                    class="reference"
                    href="http://www.advogato.org/person/titus/diary.html?start=18"
                    >Titus Brown</a
                >, but indirectly as I was looking at
                <a class="reference" href="http://pbp.berlios.de/">PBP</a>, and
                saw that Titus had also written some code for MaxQ that
                generated PBP scripts instead of Jython/unittest-based scripts.
            </p>
            <p>
                After writing some PBP scripts, it did get boring and
                error-prone quickly. I think the PBP-style of script would be
                considerably easier to <em>edit</em> than a Jython unittest, but
                MaxQ's recording feature is a better way to start the testing
                process. But like I said, I didn't want to install MaxQ...
            </p>
            <p>
                Anyway, instead I installed a wonderful little Python program
                <a
                    class="reference"
                    href="http://hathawaymix.org/Software/TCPWatch"
                    >TCPWatch</a
                >
                -- it's a small HTTP proxy that shows you the exact stuff that
                goes over the wire (good for learning and debugging lower-level
                HTTP stuff), and also has an option to record the transactions.
                It just dumps every request and response in a directory.
            </p>
            <p>
                This suited me nicely, because I could get an accurate recording
                without having to worry about the accuracy of my
                &quot;interpretation&quot; of the recording. The PBP or Jython
                script is a heuristic of sorts -- an attempt to abstract out the
                important parts of the transaction, not to simply create an
                exact recording. So you might see that the user went to
                <tt class="docutils literal"
                    ><span class="pre">/show_items</span></tt
                >
                first, then
                <tt class="docutils literal"
                    ><span class="pre">/view?id=1</span></tt
                >
                second. But it's smarter if you figure out that they went to
                <tt class="docutils literal"
                    ><span class="pre">/show_items</span></tt
                >
                and then followed the first link labelled
                <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">view</span></tt
                >. But that translation isn't <em>correct</em>, it's just best
                effort -- while tcpwatch is pretty much &quot;correct&quot;, in
                that it doesn't interpret or add any commentary to its
                recording.
            </p>
            <p>
                Anyway, I had issues with PBP, and I don't know if it's really
                the best thing for what I want. While interactive use is useful
                and important (I like the basic feel), you also have to have
                good support for rerunning scripts, getting concise and accurate
                output from those automated scripts, and rerunning or undoing
                portions of those scripts as you adapt them when the application
                changes. Now I'm thinking that
                <a class="reference" href="http://ipython.scipy.org/"
                    >ipython</a
                >
                offers a good compromise between ease of interactive use and
                translatability to a more automated environment.
            </p>
            <p>
                TCPWatch could also use a couple more features. The only real
                problem I found with the core was an inability to proxy HTTPS,
                but I imagine that's hard (since making that hard is the whole
                point of HTTPS). There were some other problems -- for instance,
                I couldn't for the life of me parse
                <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">gzip</span></tt>
                responses from Google and other sources --
                <a
                    class="reference"
                    href="http://python.org/doc/current/lib/module-gzip.html"
                    >gzip</a
                >
                barfed on them no matter what I did; I think the module is
                pickier than other gzip implementations. So it would be nice if
                TCPWatch would correct the request and remove the
                <tt class="docutils literal"
                    ><span class="pre">Accept:</span>
                    <span class="pre">gzip</span></tt
                >
                header. It would also be nice to extend the Tk frontend so you
                could annotate the requests (probably just a textbox that would
                produce a text file that went alongside the rest of the
                recording). In that case you could paste strings that were
                important to you (and that the generated test script should
                check for), or otherwise make notes for use by the script
                generator. These features would probably be easy to add --
                TCPWatch is delightfully small, at just under 1000 lines of
                code, and my first run at a script generator was just 300 lines,
                with an abbreviated but reasonable number of features.
            </p>
            <p>
                I hope to be able to revisit this stack soon as a testing
                framework: TCPWatch, Mechanize, ipython, and maybe unittest or
                py.test (or maybe even doctest). But if anyone else finds this
                idea interesting and wants to kick off an effort, I'm more than
                happy to jump on board.

                    The Zope 3 project use something called
                    <a
                        class="reference"
                        href="http://dev.zope.org/Zope3/Zope3Book/fdoctests.html"
                        >&quot;functional doctests&quot;</a
                    >. The idea is that you run tcpwatch and use your browser to
                    create a functional test for your Zope 3 application. Then
                    you run a small Python script that converts record files
                    produced by tcpwatch into .txt files that contain embedded
                    doctests, and include that file into your functional test
                    suite.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We started using functional doctests for the

                    By the way, I've found it easier to write new tests with vim
                    by copying and modifying existing tests, rather than
                    starting up tcpwatch and doing it with a browser, but I
                    suppose that depends on how geeky you are...

                        Cool, that's just the kind of thing I was thinking of.
                        It seemms a tad crude -- what with the raw requests
                        right in the code. It seems like with a little care
                        (plus something based on mechanize's stateful browser
                        object) you could improve the narrative quality nicely.
                        For instance (from your example):
                    </p>
                    <pre class="literal-block">
&gt;&gt;&gt; print http(&quot;&quot;&quot;
... POST /frogpond/resources/lily/edit.html HTTP/1.1
... Authorization: Basic mgr:mgrpw
... Content-Length: 29
... Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
...
... field.title=Foo&amp;CANCEL=Cancel
... &quot;&quot;&quot;)
HTTP/1.1 303 See Other
...
Location: http://localhost/frogpond/resources/lily
...
</pre
                    >
                    <p>Might instead be:</p>
                    <pre class="literal-block">
&gt;&gt;&gt; b.click('CANCEL')
&gt;&gt;&gt; b.response.status
303 See Other
&gt;&gt;&gt; b.response.headers.location
'http://localhost/frogpond/resources/lily'
</pre
                    >
                    <p>
                        Note that
                        <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">b</span></tt> (the
                        browser object) specifically has knowledge of the
                        context and the last request, so in this case you are
                        submitting a form that you just received. I think this
                        statefulness better represents the thing you are
                        testing, plus doctests are sequential and narrative
                        anyway -- might as well take advantage of it. In general
                        I've thought that the Zope 3 doctests I've seen seemed
                        like they didn't have enough scaffolding; there should
                        be more helper functions written solely for the purpose
                        of doctesting.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Anyway, it's still cool that it's useful and works for
                        you. The XML doctest extension I wrote might also be
                        useful for this sort of thing -- though it still needs
                        wildcards.

            I would note that the kind of testing you're referring to
            (presumably making sure nothing is broken) is not what one might
            think of as &quot;acceptance testing&quot;. To me, after you write
            the program, acceptance testing is when the user makes sure the
            program is fast enough, usable enough, and works right to solve the
            problem, which is larger in scope than automated testing to find
            bugs.<br /><br />At my work, we've considered this sort of automated
            testing for some time, but there is one increasingly important part
            of web development that they almost completely ignore: JavaScript.
            What would be nice is a Firefox plugin for acceptance testing that
            works with the JavaScript interpreter -- almost like an old-school
            macro recorder. Unfortunately, this brings up the issue of testing
            between browsers.<br /><br />Ultimately for my money on normal-size
            apps, I think there's no true replacement for spending a few hours
            each release trying everything on your site off a todo list. We do
            that each with separate browsers and usually end up catching most
            problems.<br /><br />-Ken<br /><br />

                        True... I tend to use &quot;acceptance testing&quot; for
                        everything that isn't &quot;unit testing&quot;, but
                        that's probably not very accurate. Functional testing or
                        system testing is probably a better term. Though Grig
                        pointed me to this:
                        <a
                            class="reference"
                            href="http://atomicobject.com/systir.page"
                            >http://atomicobject.com/systir.page</a
                        >
                        (a Ruby test system) which is really an acceptance test
                        (specifying requirements at a fairly low but not
                        obscenely low level), and that could fit into this
                        model. It's not a comprehensive acceptance test, but it
                        isn't too far off. Automated acceptance testing is
                        possible -- FIT is an example of that sort of thing.

                        Selenium or Pamie are options for Javascript-run tests
                        (from Grig's article). John Lee also put Javascript in
                        his to-do for his stack (ClientForm, ClientCookie,
                        Mechanize, etc); I think using Mozilla's interpreter or
                        something. But who knows about that...
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Generally I do manual Javascript testing, but that still
                        leaves a place for automated tests. By avoiding dynamic
                        Javascript and making sure your app degrades properly in
                        the absence of Javascript, you can avoid regressions in
                        your Javascript and make the application accessible to
                        an automated testing tool.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Also, by doing this as a script you can avoid
                        sensibility entirely -- you can jump to another page
                        based on any calculation you choose, possibly derived
                        from a regular expression-based parsing or whatever
                        works. You aren't restricted to just following links and
                        filling in forms that you can find on the page.

                        I have looked at it before, but my natural laziness with
                        respect to function testing kept me from using it. PBP
                        was the first thing that really felt right. Though now
                        I'm also thinking positively about doctest, and I can
                        imagine webunit and doctest being a good combination
                        (maybe also building on the XML doctest extension I
                        talked about earlier:
                        <a class="reference" href="xml-and-doctest.html"
                            >https://ianbicking.org/xml-and-doctest.html</a
                        >
                        )
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I guess webunit and Mechanize have similar scopes, but I
                        haven't really thought about how they compare.
