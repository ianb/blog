        <h1>WSGI Implementations</h1>
        <p>
            There's been a number of implementations of
            <a href="http://www.python.org/peps/pep-0333.html">WSGI</a> in the
            last week or so:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                Alan Kennedy released version 0.2 of
                <a href="http://www.xhaus.com/modjy/">modjy</a>, which is a WSGI
                server that runs in a Java servlet container (using Jython).
                He's had to deal with some of the issues of implementing WSGI
                under Python 2.1, particularly iterators, but he's done some
                work to mitigate those problems (in part by simulating the
                Python 2.2 interator protocol).
            </li>

            <li>
                Peter Hunt has implemented a Twisted Resource version of the
                WSGI server, in addition to some other miscellaneous WSGI code
                and tests. It's at
                <a
                    href="http://colorstudy.com/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/trunk/WSGI/phunt/"
                    >svn://colorstudy.com/trunk/WSGI/phunt</a
                >, but I can't get to that site at the moment. Using the Twisted
                server just requires an import and a single method call (once
                Twisted is installed, of course) -- doesn't even seem to require
                mktap. For all of these the setup is fairly simple.
            </li>

            <li>
                Phillip Eby (author of the WSGI PEP) has converted his web code
                in <a href="http://peak.telecommunity.com/">PEAK</a> (Python
                Enterprise Application Kit) to WSGI. It includes a CGI, FastCGI,
                and SimpleHTTPServer implementation. FastCGI is a protocol where
                the webserver (e.g., Apache) talks to a separate long-running
                Python process. SimpleHTTPServer is a
                <a
                    href="http://python.org/doc/current/lib/module-SimpleHTTPServer.html"
                    >standard library module</a
                >
                that implements a stand-alone HTTP server.
                <a
                    href="http://mail.python.org/pipermail/web-sig/2004-October/000966.html"
                    >Read more in his mail to Web-SIG</a
                >. The FastCGI server looks particularly interesting to me.
            </li>
        </ul>

        I think there's a good working set of servers now. To fill it out there
        should also be a <a href="http://modpython.org">mod_python</a>
        server, an ASP/IIS server, and maybe a Medusa server. I can't think of
        any other servers that we really need, except maybe a server for
        interactive debugging, and perhaps some other non-production "tool"
        servers.

        <p>
            Really the next step is to get some more frameworks ported. I'm
            really hoping other frameworks can also be factored into
            framework-neutral portions, like I've been working with in
            <a
                href="http://mail.python.org/pipermail/web-sig/2004-October/000929.html"
                >WSGI Webware</a
            >. But even if not, for most frameworks it should be fairly easy to
            port the framework in one big chunk -- any framework that supports a
            non-CGI option should be easy to port.
