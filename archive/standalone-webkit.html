            It's been sitting on my hard disk for a while now, and I thought I'd
            put it out there even though it's quite rough. I think this
            addresses some of the biggest problems with Webware right now, and
            giving it the potential to be more accessible.

            this could be the last chance for me to use webware, i don't wanna
            sound agressive or anything, i just want to share some thoughts
            about ww.
            <br />

            <br />
            i've spent months playing around with ww but recently i've started
            to hate it, since i need more freedom in the web app layout (i'm
            considering to have the sitemap in a separate conf file).
            <br />

            <br />
            what i find frustrating in webware is that it caches everything.
            yes, i known, turn on "autoreload". :)
            <br />

            <br />
            ...and another irritaning thing: one-servlet-per-file. i just find
            the mod_python publish approach a lot more elegant.
            <br />

            <br />
            if this version is more flexibile than the original it would be cool
            to give it a try.
            <br />

            <br />
            i'll keep an eye on it, i promise.
            <br />

            Webware already has a lot more flexibility than people often
            appreciate. Webware's Servlets, and the Page class that people
            usually use, are just the beginning of building an application --
            application and site customizations are an important part of
            adapting it to your needs.
            <br />

            <br />
            This could probably stand to be better documented, but it's
            difficult to say how -- it's more like presenting Webware recipes
            than specific documentation you can follow along with. There's some
            stuff along this lines that people have contributed to the

            Not to belittle the work put into Webware since the early days, but
            Webware seemed to be ripe for a refactoring. As for whether
            mod_python is more suitable for certain kinds of Web applications,
            I'd say that Webware provides enough interesting functionality for
            you to build a plug-in for other kinds of resources that present
            themselves in different ways.
            <br />

            <br />
            However, mod_python does seem to step more out of the way in certain
            areas, whereas Webware seems to make certain decisions for you (eg.
            resources must be "concrete" files) whether that is what you want or
            not.

            Webware has some changes to URL handling in CVS (and in WebKit
            standalone) that are quite flexible, which would allow you to
            introduce considerably different ways of representing a servlet.
            (Servlets are still core, but the actual servlet interface is so
            minimal that it can serve as the basis for pretty much whatever you
            want to do)

            Ian,
            <br />

            <br />
            1. I have tried to trackback to your stories a few times but it does
            not seem to be working. Also typepad's quickpost bookmarklet does
            not pickup your trackback url automatically (I guess
            possibly/probably related).
            <br />

            <br />
            2. Although I don't yet use webware I have found this exciting
            progress, but there does not seem to have been a great deal of
            reaction on the mailing lists. Can you see this going forward to
            become the standard webware?
            <br />

            <br />
            Dee,
            <br />

            "...and another irritaning thing: one-servlet-per-file. i just find
            the mod_python publish approach a lot more elegant."
            <br />

            <br />
            In large projects with rapid change and a sizable team I find this
            is a big advantage.

            Dave: sigh, I don't know about traceback... I've not had the easiest
            time with the server software (PyCS), so I'm not feeling
            enthusiastic about diving into it :( Maybe I'll switch to Syndicato
            sometime, it looks neat.
            <br />

            <br />
            There hasn't been a lot of reaction on the mailing list. The Webware
            mailing list isn't that reactive. It's kind of sad -- there's just
            not a lot of enthusiasm or experimentation in the Webware community,
            for whatever reason. Maybe other frameworks have been able to steal
            away the developers who would be more interested in that sort of
            thing. Maybe all those developers just start their own projects
            (there's so damn many). I'll come back to it, but I already have a
            number of other projects which I'm involved in, so I'm spread a
            little thin, and I find it hard to keep my enthusiam going on
            Webware. I'm sure I'm not the only one. It's a problem. I've even
            had a hard time keeping my enthusiasm going with Web-SIG, which has
            the potential to deal with a lot of these same issues, and issues
            which I think are extremely important to Python.

            Ian,
            <br />

            <br />
            No worries about trackback.
            <br />

            <br />
            I tend to agree with your feelings about the status of a lot of
            python stuff. WebSig, Cheetah and Webware are good examples of
            projects that seem to be dying. SqlObject is looking much more
            positive. Unfortunately I can't find other active projects with
            architectures that I like as much as webware and cheetah.

            To its credit Cheetah isn't really dying -- people seem to use it a
            fair amount. But no one who uses it is really modifying Cheetah
            itself. Webware has been similar in some ways. It's probably in
            large part on the basis of the original author's focus -- both Chuck
            and Tavis have not been focused on their software. I don't really
            know, but I imagine they are just focused on work, life, etc. So it
            goes. Making a piece of software that is developed in a lively
            fashion while the original developer is away can be difficult, and I
            don't know what the trick is. Open Source isn't nearly as easy as
            it's made out to be ;)

            Regarding Trackback and PyCS/PyDS: the problem here isn't the server
            software, it's more the site structure. PyDS generates no single
            posting pages like MoveableType or other systems do, it generates
            multiple postings pages (and archive pages) like Radio does. The
            problem here is that trackback autodiscovery based on HTML only
            works good if you have one posting per page, as the client software
            can't know which of those multiple postings to refer by what
            trackback URL. So PyDS doesn't generate autodicovery for trackback.
            But PyDS does add trackback:ping headers to the RSS feed, so
            aggregators should be able to get the trackback URL for individual
            postings from there. The trackback URL for entries is the same to
            ping as to see the trackbacks. So if you wan't to trackback one
            article, just use the "trackbacks" link and add that individually to
            your posting to ping. This might be possible with Typepad, but I
            don't know much about Typepad - but it is possible with moveable
            type, at least if you disable the autodiscovery stuff.

            Yep I can enter the trackback url's into typepad manually, but they
            have not seemed to be picked up here. Anyway I can just use the
            comments instead. Thanks for the hints.

            INRE WebWare enthusiasm....
            <br />

            <br />
            For what it's worth, I picked up on WebWare for a project I'm
            working on, and I hope WebWare stays around for a while. I was
            impressed by installing it, getting it to work, and bootstrapping my
            own project with it in just a few days, having only a few minutes
            each day to tinker.
            <br />

            <br />
            I plan on expanding the project to use Cheetah, once I get things
            sorted out.
            <br />

            <br />
            I've continued to research other options since finding WebWare, but
            none of the other frameworks or application servers have made me
            reconsider.
