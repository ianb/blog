                >) on the state of the encryption business. But he doesn't just
                whine, he comes up with an interesting analysis:
            </p>
            <blockquote>
                <p>
                    The decline of the security industry is based upon a basic
                    disconnect between the business world and the security
                    world.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Within the security industry we base our models of trust
                    upon mathematics. We strive to continually push the envelope
                    by codifying security and improving it. On the other hand
                    the business industry bases its models of trust upon risk.
                    It balances the risk of a bad outcome, the cost of that bad
                    outcome, and the cost of reducing that risk. Even if a
                    system is technically insecure, the business world will
                    accept it if the risk of a security breach is low, the cost
                    of a security breach is low, or the cost of closing that
                    breach is high.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Where our model is mathematics, theirs is economics. These
                    two models worked well in tandem for quite a few years; the
                    need for a security industry was initially obvious because
                    of the totally undefined risks and the potentially high
                    costs that were out there, waiting to be taken advantage of.
                </p>
                <p>
                    But now, years later, we've done our job too well. We've
                    taken all those undefined risks and codified them -- made
                    them real and quantifiable. We've offered real
                    demonstrations of online security through years of
                    ecommerce, and in doing so we've proven lower rates of
                    credit card fraud, and almost total proof from high-cost
                    offline problems like extortion and bad reputation. We've
                    helped fill out business' risk models and so shown when we
                    were necessary and when weren't.

                I would add that it's not just the cost of closing a breach or
                implementing a secure system -- increased security often has a
                significant effect on usability and reliability of systems (for
                the worse). But then
                <a
                    class="reference"
                    href="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2004/02/security_crypto.html#reliability"
                    >he brings this up too</a
                >. We don't need more secure systems -- at least in most
                traditional areas of security concern -- we need more usable
                security.
            </p>
            <p>
                Outside of business concerns -- i.e., for individuals -- there's
                still a lot of security problems. But then,
                <a
                    class="reference"
                    href="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2004/02/security_crypto.html#enabling"
                    >he talks about that too</a
                >, so now I'm just repeating him. Anyway, interesting article.
