                second one. If Sun got rid of their stupid licensing I suspect I
                might even grow to care about the JVM; but because Sun is
                stupid, Java related tools are a pain to deal with on open
                source platforms. Open source developers are good at making
                things less painful, but Sun is too caught up in its
                self-importance to let us. But that's an aside.
            </p>
            <p>
                But my point: here is a bandwagon we can jump on! So you want
                the JVM for you web app, but you don't want to write it in Java
                and J2EE? Python is right on the cusp of being highly usable
                there.
            </p>
            <p>
                What needs to be done? Not that much.
                <a class="reference" href="http://www.jython.org/">Jython</a> of
                course needs to be updated to match Python 2.4. Luckily after a
                dormant period I hear Jython development has picked up some, and
                it's pretty close already. Then we need web frameworks. But we
                already have those in spades. So we need a WSGI adapter -- which
                we have in
                <a class="reference" href="http://www.xhaus.com/modjy/">modjy</a
                >. Every WSGI-enabled web framework won't magically work when
                that happens, but we'll be <em>really close</em>. There will be
                stuff to tweak, new database drivers to test (I thought there
                was a JDBC DBAPI driver, but I can't find it), and installation
                processes to figure out. But there's no huge leaps that have to
                occur.
            </p>
            <p>
                I personally remain indifferent to the JVM (and frankly
                indifferent to the corporate culture it represents), but there's
                real opportunity here for someone to take up.

                    I can't say I disagree. There seems to be a certain mindset
                    that comes with the Java/JVM bandwagon that kind of turns me
                    off to the entire thing. Let's not even talk about the J2EE

                        The JVM is a platform of sorts. Though from what I see,
                        it's not a particularly popular platform for the open
                        source community; I feel like the open source
                        development that occurs on it is disassociated from the
                        rest of the open source community. Nevertheless, there's
                        a lot of disaffected programmers on that platform, some
                        of who <em>may</em> be a benefit to the open source
                        community. And most of who may not be any benefit at
                        all. It's a testiment to a certain disfunction there
                        that Jython isn't a more active project, as it seems to
                        get a signficant amount of use, but not contributions.

                        I go back and forth on this sort of thing. I recognize
                        some people need the JVM. A lot of people, really, for
                        legacy reasons. I don't have any particular problem with
                        the JVM -- except that the most common implementations
                        are proprietary. But I also think most people on that
                        platform aren't choosing to get off it, and if they
                        aren't willing to make that choice, it doesn't
                        necessarily help us to bring people a choice they don't
                        really care about.

                            I develop a Open Source app with Jython/Java and I
                            use Sun's VM on Linux. Guess what I don't have one

                                By &quot;Sun is dumb&quot; I only mean
                                Sun-the-company and their Java licensing. The
                                Java policy seems to put a lot of importance in
                                compatibility and certification and whatnot,
                                which would be fine for people who care about
                                that stuff (a rapidly diminishing number of
                                people), except Sun keeps people from fixing
                                their packaging and distribution as a result. If
                                you are serious about Java you figure these
                                things out -- you run their installers, set up
                                your CLASSPATH, etc. If you aren't serious (like
                                myself) you don't figure these things out, and
                                you ignore Java as a platform. If it was easy
                                for me to run test suites on Jython I would.
                                There's lots of other platforms that I'm not
                                serious about that I use regardless, because
                                they are easy and well integrated into whatever
                                OS I'm on (since that OS is often Debian-related
                                all the more reason this licensing causes
                                problems). Java is not one of them.

                                Sun's concern about the cross-platform
                                compatibility of their platform is outdated. The
                                only real malicious forker (MS) has dropped Java
                                for .NET. And I don't think Sun every really
                                delivered in a practical way on the
                                write-once-run-anywhere promise anyway. Maybe
                                their accomplishments would mean something to
                                someone coming from a proprietary C background,
                                but it's thoroughly unimpressive to anyone using
                                Python, and not even very impressive compared to
                                open source C projects (where compatibility is
                                achievable through feedback, not restrictions).
                                It's created a situation where Java seems
                                hostile to the host platform, hostile to
                                packaging systems of all kinds, and ultimately
                                hostile towards users. But every system has
                                flaws; the problem with Java is that Sun won't
                                let other people fix those flaws.

                                    I don't have any of these problems your
                                    talking about so I guess were on different
                                    pages of the universe. :) Ive been using
                                    Java on my Linux Suse distro for 4-5 years
                                    and Ive never had a problem installing the
                                    software. For someone who develops with Java
                                    it is important to me that my app(s) will
                                    run on Windows as it runs on Linux, and they
                                    do. So the cross platform compatibility is a
                                    plus for me. I don't know if you pay much
                                    attention to what goes on in the Java world
                                    but there definately is work going on to
                                    provide better integration with the native
                                    platforms. You can look at the JDIC project
                                    for example.

                <p>The JVM give me a few key features:</p>
                <ul class="simple">
                    <li>
                        Allows me to take a single file and hand it off to
                        operations - They can then run it in a 'container' and
                        they can monitored and care for the app
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Allows use of third party services via libraries (JVM
                        has a better public/private notion then python)
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    I know that a good sysadmin can manager a python app as
                    well, and the ability to make a python wrapper around c/c++
                    takes us a long way as well, but the JVM is important.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I've been thinking about the JVM to support a ESB (<a
                        class="reference"
                        href="http://mule.codehaus.org/"
                        >http://mule.codehaus.org/</a
                    >). Do the Java bits in java, and the agile parts in python,
                    and link them up with clean API's. Unless the overhead of
                    the extra socket call is too much I like this better then
                    running Jython in the JVM.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Once you have the overhead of a J2EE server I don't think
                    scripting langs buy you that much. And I feel that you would
                    lose a lot by trying to run a java app server in a non-J2EE
                    environment. J2EE is complex because it helps solve complex
                    problems, its just that not all web apps are all that
                    complex......

                        the only place I can see scripting saving you anythin is
                        in a JSP, but really you shouldn't have that much code
                        in those things anyway. A Jython instance is not that
                        hard to embed and work with, in fact its quite simple. I
                        have a custom shell for Jython fairly well developed and
                        it not that hard to manipulate the PythonInterperter via
                        its api. Im going to assume that it will be much simpler
                        to work with the interpreter in the runtime than playing
                        with a socket connection, even if it is hidden behind a
                        good API.

                    With respect to Python Web framework technologies and the
                    Java platform, WebStack has supported the Java Servlet API
                    for some time. Of course, even with your Web application
                    code running in Jython, you still need to be able to access
                    all those convenient libraries that are available for
                    CPython. Consequently, it takes a bit of work to have things
                    like libxslt, rdflib and the other interesting stuff
                    switched out with capable equivalents using the same API -
                    more work than I'd be willing to put in right now, anyway.

                <p>I can't understand what people have against Java or Sun.</p>
                <p>
                    Java is the best language for some jobs - it has great
                    tools, great documentation and a great speed. It has also
                    some bad parts as swing, but Overall it's really great. Ok,
                    the web frameworks suck compared to Python frameworks, but
                    that is not so much because of Java, but because of stupid
                    framework designs.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now I have read a lot of people bashing Java (especially the
                    Rails folks), and frankly their bashing is groundless.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I code a lot in Python and I love that language. But I have
                    also had experience with Java, and Java is also pretty neat
                    for some applications. Now, Python and Java combined could
                    produce some great results! Python because of the very nice
                    syntax, nice design and Java because of speed, documentation
                    and &quot;tools&quot;...
                </p>
                <p>
                    I share you thoughts on Sun freeing Java, BUT it's a very
                    bad argument to hate Sun. Sun does a GREAT deal for free
                    software - - like OpenOffice and Solaris! And I can't
                    understand that people don't credit them for that...
                </p>

                        I can't believe it would be that terrible of a chore to
                        develop a Jython based Web framework for j2ee. The web
                        side is primitive because you are supposed to build a
                        framework up from it, the freedom is yours to decide.
                        Sun acknowledges this and its considered a good practice
                        to use a web framework. Ill have to check some of the
                        links on this page out, maybe one alread exists.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In my experience in developing both in Java and Jython
                        at the same time, its been enjoyable. Both are simple
                        languages, so its not hard to reason about the code in
                        either case. It also isn't that hard to translate
                        between the two. The biggest headache Ive encountered is
                        reasoning about how a python truth can be mapped to a
                        java truth. Python: if something: ..do something
                    </p>
                    <p>java: if ??????</p>
                    <p>
                        since something can be true in many cases, not like the
                        good ol simple if(true){
                    </p>
                    <p>}</p>
                    <p>
                        I had the choice of buying &quot;Beyond Java&quot; or
                        &quot;Swing Hacks&quot; this last weekend. I perused
                        &quot;Beyond Java&quot; and saw that it seemed to
                        dismiss Python as a language because it relies too much
                        on whitespace and the community isn't friendly and too
                        academic. At that juncture I didn't care what the author
                        had to say anymore and put the book back up on the
                        shelf. Ive read one of his other books and really didn't
                        get anything out of it. Not sure why I would need to
                        read another of his &quot;I Dont Like Java Books&quot;,
                        you'd think one would be enough. :D I would think people
                        could be able to decide if they like a technology or not
                        by just using it. Then I perused &quot;Swing Hacks&quot;
                        and after reading a couple of pages thought that it
                        looked like a lot of fun, and it is! If your a Swing
                        user who likes to play with the internals of the widgets
                        and make cool stuff, it probably would be a book you'd
                        like. If your a Swing user who just likes to plop
                        widgets together, well it might be for you to! It might
                        just inspire you to dig into the Swing source and make
                        magic happen.
