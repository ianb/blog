                system. Zero Install is kind of like MacOS X application
                bundles, though with an important added feature: instead of
                explicitly copying bundles into your application folder, you
                only run them remotely (NFS?), with heavy caching so that
                effectively you are running them locally (but updates can happen
                magically). As usual there's lots of people talking about how
                wonderfully simpler MacOS packages are compared to Linux.
            </p>
            <p>
                In some ways this seems better than Mac's system, because it
                saves a lot of management issues, including dependency (since
                one bundle can refer to another bundle, and installation is
                implicit). Though it opens up a lot of issues as well -- what
                happens when different updates conflict, e.g., package A and B
                both depend on package C, but A and B both depend on different
                versions. This will be quite common as the packages are
                incrementally updated by their respective authors. Explicit
                updating of installed software gives an opportunity to manage
                these conflicts.
            </p>
            <p>
                Ultimately, I think bundles are the wrong solution to packaging.
                They handle the simple case, and that's not very interesting.
                But part of why they appear to be a good solution on MacOS X is
                because that is largely a proprietary platform. Proprietary
                applications tend to be more self-contained, and include all
                their dependencies, because proprietary software makers can't
                cooperate with each other (there's just little incentive). Open
                source applications, however, are part of a whole community of
                software, and have extensive dependencies and interactions.
                Because there's no commercial overhead, the factoring of
                applications also tends to be more fine-grained.
            </p>
            <p>
                But even in the proprietary world, MacOS's system is deficient.
                Installers are still fairly common -- perhaps those installers
                just place the bundle in the right location, but that is
                impossible for me to know. And there's no common way to choose
                or understand important configuration settings: Which
                application is the default handler (for a mime type, email,
                etc)? If I install a plugin, how does it know which browsers I
                have installed? If I install a service, how do I know it doesn't
                conflict with other services? (Only one service per port, after
                all)
            </p>
            <p>
                Obviously much of Linux software can't be put in bundles
                currently. Part of the ideal of bundles is that they encourage
                decoupled application design, so even if we can't do it now,
                maybe the discipline would make our software better. But
                decoupling simply isn't possible, and the entire point of a
                packaging system is to robustly deal with the times when
                decoupled applications aren't possible: to deal with the
                <em>system</em>. Naive systems like bundles simply aren't robust
                with respect to conflicts and application interactions, even as
                simple as they seem from the outside. Software that isn't robust
                isn't user friendly, <em>especially</em> when it comes to system
                management (a task every user has and no user wants).
            </p>
            <p>
                If packaging is seen as too complicated, I think that's because
                we pay too much attention to the filesystem. The user has no
                place in the modern filesystem. There's nothing useful for them
                to do there. There are some select places where they can do
                something --
                <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">/etc</span></tt
                >, some parts of
                <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">/var</span></tt>
                (e.g.,
                <tt class="docutils literal"
                    ><span class="pre">/var/www</span></tt
                >), and
                <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">/home</span></tt
                >. That's it. (And while paths differ, the same is largely true
                for Windows and MacOS as well.) All the other parts of the
                filesystem are managed by specific applications (and even
                <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">/etc</span></tt>
                should really be managed as well). Even inside
                <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">/home</span></tt>
                there are managed areas --
                <tt class="docutils literal"
                    ><span class="pre">Library</span></tt
                >
                on MacOS, or a pile of
                <tt class="docutils literal"
                    ><span class="pre">.whatever</span></tt
                >
                files in Linux.
            </p>
            <p>
                The filesystem isn't even any good for users where they should
                have control. Files that users manage need to be versioned and
                well indexed -- things that aren't particular important for
                application files. The dumb pile-of-bits filesystems that we use
                are perfectly fine for storing program files and associated
                data, and there's no reason we should forgo that. But we
                shouldn't ask more of that pile of bits than it can provide.
                Bundles turn the file system into a package manager. But it
                should be fairly obvious that the file system (or the Finder or
                ROX filer) isn't going to be the kind of rich interface
                necessary for this most essential of system administration
                tasks.

            An important feature of application packages is the separation of
            authority between the OS and the application. The installer needs to
            protect the system from the vendor. Most of the problems with
            Windows applications arise because the vendor-provided application
            installers have always been allowed to walk all over the operating
            system. RPM was a great leap forward, since the executable code was
            provided by the system and the package contained only information.
            Essentially, packages are interpreted by the RPM runtime. This
            leaves control in the hands of the root user, not the app provider.
            The Amiga installer was actually a lisp dialect interpreter! One
            could argue the the usefulness of the the Gentoo Portage system
            comes from layering a standard install api on code from varied
            sources and allowing the system to set common options across all
            installs easily. I'm sure Debian users would preach the joys of that
            system as well.

            Dependencies are clearly a hard problem, especially with binary
            packages, since the unix idiom is that all options and dependencies
            need to be configured at compile-time. That problem really centers
            around code design, not packaging. The best that a packaging system
            can do is NOT MAKE IT WORSE. A good packaging system makes a system
            manageable by putting the authority in the hands of the operator. A
            weak or nonexistant packaging system leads to dll hell, packages
            breaking other packages and brittle, unstable systems.

            Note that RPM and dpkg both allow for arbitrary code to be run on
            package installation or removal -- but because a lot of the process
            is automated by the tool, these scripts can be more limited in
            scope. This doesn't tend to be a problem, because package authors
            don't go too crazy -- it's used for things like byte compiling code,
            doing database upgrades, updating configuration scripts, etc. But
            if, say, Gator (or whatever they're called now) created a Linux
            package of their product, they could be nearly as evil as they are
            on Windows.

            I want a packaging system that relies on the features of a
            transactional filesystem. OK, I want a transactional filesystem too.
            ;-) This would make it possible to install packages without fear of
            fucking things up too badly on a running system, as I could just
            roll the back the transaction implied by the install. I can dream,
            anwyay.
            <br />

            <br />
            Also, I think current Linux packaging systems like RPM and dpkg are
            too centered around the "one instance of this piece of software
            installed in a canonical location" theme. This is really nice for
            lots of "singleton" things that you don't really want to think too
            hard about (for instance, bash), but it kind of sucks if you want to
            install more than one instance of a piece of software on a machine
            or want to install as a nonroot user. Granted, it's possible to
            create "retargetable" RPMs and spell explicit installation locations
            in different ways, but most dpkg and RPM packages aren't created in
            ways that allow you to do this easily. I also don't want to need to
            install packages as the root user just to maintain the shared
            package metadata database... I'd rather install as a "normal" user
            and have per-user metadata databases that allowed me to choose the
            files on which the packages' dependencies relied interactively. I'll
            stop now, because if I don't, I'll have to do something about it.
            ;-)
