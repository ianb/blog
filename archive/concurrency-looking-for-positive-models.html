                about threading. Which is odd, since I hadn't mentioned
                threading, and it really was entirely off-topic. (OK,
                technically it related to Prothon's lack of a Global Interpreter
                Lock, but I ignored that in my post because the GIL

                During PyCon Bruce Eckel talked a little bit about threads in
                his speach. Not a lot -- it was incidental to the main topic.
                But it got a strong reaction from people -- heckling from the
                crowd (good spirited though it was), and I'm sure Bruce heard
                other reactions after. Whenever someone asks how to use threads,
                there's always someone else who says &quot;don't&quot;.
            </p>
            <p>
                Personally, my experience hasn't been so bad. There's been some
                annoying problems, but frankly concurrency is hard, and a lot of
                the problems have been due to concurrency issues that wouldn't
                be magically solved by a different form of concurrency. And a
                lot of people get things done with threads... isn't that the
                real test?
            </p>
            <p>
                What I don't see is a practical alternative being presented in
                most cases. That is, an alternative that is easy to use,
                reliable, and doesn't require you to twist your mind around new
                ways of programming (pun not intended... or maybe it is
                subconsciously?)
            </p>
            <p>
                When people are getting stuff done using threads, it's not a
                very convincing argument to tell them they are just wrong. And
                you can take my blocking calls from my cold, dead hands! So
                what's the realistic alternative? What's the example application
                that deals with concurrency safely and pleasantly, with a
                manageable codebase that is friendly to outsiders? I don't want
                to drink the Kool Aid, I just want to get things done. For all
                those that feel the same, threads so far have been the safe bet.
            </p>
            <p>
                (Okay, I'll admit it, I wrote this while procrastinating on
                fixing some threading bugs; oh irony!)

            Reading through this and the previous discussions, Jython seems to
            provide an MP solution for those who need it. IronPython might as
            well, so why throw out the baby (python) or the bathwater (GIL)?

            The "Why events are a bad idea" paper DOES NOT APPLY TO PRE-EMPTIVE
            THREADING IMPLEMENTATIONS LIKE PTHREADS! Yes, of course, if you
            write your own specific threading implementation designed to be
            faster, easier and more predictable than standard
            works-in-my-compiler-right-now events, then YES IT WILL BE EASIER.
            No shit!
            <br />

            <br />
            If you want "blocking" calls without koolaid, use Stackless. It
            offers a CSP paradigm. Otherwise, you're going to need to drink some
            koolaid because Python needs macros and/or new syntax to do other
            kinds of "sugar free" magic concurrency.

            One word: Oz!
            <br />

            <br />
            Oz isn't the last (or the first) word in declarative concurrency,
            but I strongly recommend playing with it, if only for a little
            while, just so you can see how much the DC/CSP approach changes
            things. It doesn't solve all your problems at once, but it gives you
            a perspective from which the "low-hanging fruit" appears in
            *completely* different places.

            I agree with you Ian. Until I'm dragged into some environment that
            provides a relatively easy alternative to threads (by which I mean,
            I can do blocking calls or something that looks a lot like them),
            I'm sticking with threads. A lot of people say that "threads are for
            people who don't understand a state machine". I've written my share
            of event-driven asynchronous code in which I need to maintain a
            state machine, and I'll just need to admit that, yes, I'm too dumb.
            The faster I need to get the job done, the dumber I become. It just
            takes me far too long to figure out what the states *are*,
            especially in anything more than something trivial. time.sleep(30)!

            In static languages like C, an event-based system offers some
            complication and hindrance. But in Python, it has been relatively
            easy for me to write in an event-based manner, because of dynamic
            function declaration.
            <br />

            <br />
            Here's a code snippet from my application, Mnet, boiled down to
            minimal form:
            <br />

            <br />
            def request_block_from_peer(self, peerId, blockId):
            <br />
            def _handle_request_block_result(outcome, failure_reason=None):
            <br />
            # No matter what comes out of this reply, we are removing this
            <br />
            # blockId/peerId pair from the located-blocks data. (Because either
            <br />
            # this result means that we now have the block, or it means that the
            <br />
            # peer does not have the block!)
            <br />
            self.data.remove_Ids_of_located_blocks(peerId, blockIds=(blockId,))
            <br />
            if failure_reason or (outcome['result'] != "success"):
            <br />
            # Inform reliability handicapper that this was actually a failure.
            <br />
            self.mtm._keeper.get_counterparty_object(peerId).decrement_reliability()
            <br />
            # Wake the block wrangling strategy -- failure to retrieve a block
            is the kind of thing that it might want to respond to.
            <br />
            self.strategy.schedule_event()
            <br />
            else:
            <br />
            self._handle_block(blockId, outcome['data'], peerId)
            <br />

            <br />
            self.mtm.initiate(peerId, "request block", blockId,
            outcome_func=_handle_timely_request_block_result)
            <br />

            <br />
            Back in the bad old days when this project used Python's
            multithreading, this code would have looked something like this:
            <br />

            <br />
            def request_block_from_peer(self, peerId, blockId):
            <br />
            try:
            <br />
            outcome = self.mtm.initiate(peerId, "request block", blockId)
            <br />
            except TransactionFailure, le:
            <br />
            outcome = {'result': "transaction failure", 'le': le}
            <br />

            <br />
            # No matter what comes out of this reply, we are removing this
            <br />
            # blockId/peerId pair from the located-blocks data. (Because either
            <br />
            # this result means that we now have the block, or it means that the
            <br />
            # peer does not have the block!)
            <br />
            self.data.remove_Ids_of_located_blocks(peerId, blockIds=(blockId,))
            <br />

            <br />
            if outcome['result'] != "success":
            <br />
            # Inform reliability handicapper that this was actually a failure.
            <br />
            self.mtm._keeper.get_counterparty_object(peerId).decrement_reliability()
            <br />
            # Wake the block wrangling strategy -- failure to retrieve a block
            is the kind of thing that it might want to respond to.
            <br />
            self.strategy.notify()
            <br />
            return None
            <br />
            else:
            <br />
            return (blockId, outcome['data'], peerId,)
            <br />

            <br />

            <br />
            Now, the multithreading version might be easier to read because the
            sequence of runtime events follows the sequence of code, but I hope
            you will agree that the event-based version is clear enough.
            <br />

            <br />
            The nice thing about the event-based approach is that I don't have
            to spend any time worrying about the possibility that data will
            change out from under me during the execution of the
            "_handle_request_block_result()" function. That function, and *all*
            functions, get executed atomically, in their entirety, without any
            of the data that they depend on changing in any way other than as
            dictated by the code of that one function. It is difficult to
            express what a blessed relief it is to be able to just naively read
            the code and assume that if it says "remove the id and then
            decrement the reliability" then both of those effects will happen
            atomically, and it will not make any difference which order you do
            them in, and the data will not unexpectedly change between the first
            event and the second.
            <br />

            <br />
            Anyway, when I started out to write this note I just wanted to
            emphasize to you that for me, using Python, switching from
            multithreaded to event-based was relatively painless. I've also had
            to do the same in some C code recently and it was a lot more hassle
            in C.

            easy for me to write in an event-based manner, because of dynamic
            function declaration.
            <br />

            <br />
            Here's a code snippet from my application, Mnet, boiled down to
            minimal form:
            <br />

            <br />
            ____def request_block_from_peer(self, peerId, blockId):
            <br />
            ________def _handle_request_block_result(outcome,
            failure_reason=None):
            <br />
            ____________# No matter what comes out of this reply, we are
            removing this
            <br />
            ____________# blockId/peerId pair from the located-blocks data.
            (Because either
            <br />
            ____________# this result means that we now have the block, or it
            means that the
            <br />
            ____________# peer does not have the block!)
            <br />
            ____________self.data.remove_Ids_of_located_blocks(peerId,
            blockIds=(blockId,))
            <br />
            ____________if failure_reason or (outcome['result'] != "success"):
            <br />
            ________________# Inform reliability handicapper that this was
            actually a failure.
            <br />
            ________________self.mtm._keeper.get_counterparty_object(peerId).decrement_reliability()
            <br />
            ________________# Wake the block wrangling strategy -- failure to
            retrieve a block is the kind of thing that it might want to respond
            to.
            <br />
            ________________self.strategy.schedule_event()
            <br />
            ____________else:
            <br />
            ________________self._handle_block(blockId, outcome['data'], peerId)
            <br />
            _
            <br />
            ________self.mtm.initiate(peerId, "request block", blockId,
            outcome_func=_handle_timely_request_block_result)
            <br />

            <br />
            Back in the bad old days when this project used Python's
            multithreading, this code would have looked something like this:
            <br />

            <br />
            ____def request_block_from_peer(self, peerId, blockId):
            <br />
            ________try:
            <br />
            ____________outcome = self.mtm.initiate(peerId, "request block",
            blockId)
            <br />
            ________except TransactionFailure, le:
            <br />
            ____________outcome = {'result': "transaction failure", 'le': le}
            <br />
            _
            <br />
            ________# No matter what comes out of this reply, we are removing
            this
            <br />
            ________# blockId/peerId pair from the located-blocks data. (Because
            either
            <br />
            ________# this result means that we now have the block, or it means
            that the
            <br />
            ________# peer does not have the block!)
            <br />
            ________self.data.remove_Ids_of_located_blocks(peerId,
            blockIds=(blockId,))
            <br />
            _
            <br />
            ________if outcome['result'] != "success":
            <br />
            ____________# Inform reliability handicapper that this was actually
            a failure.
            <br />
            ____________self.mtm._keeper.get_counterparty_object(peerId).decrement_reliability()
            <br />
            ____________# Wake the block wrangling strategy -- failure to
            retrieve a block is the kind of thing that it might want to respond
            to.
            <br />
            ____________self.strategy.notify()
            <br />
            ____________return None
            <br />
            ________else:
            <br />
            ____________return (blockId, outcome['data'], peerId,)
            <br />

            <br />

            <br />
            Now, the multithreading version might be easier to read because the
            sequence of runtime events follows the sequence of code, but I hope
            you will agree that the event-based version is clear enough.
            <br />

            <br />
            The nice thing about the event-based approach is that I don't have
            to spend any time worrying about the possibility that data will
            change out from under me during the execution of the
            "_handle_request_block_result()" function. That function, and *all*
            functions, get executed atomically, in their entirety, without any
            of the data that they depend on changing in any way other than as
            dictated by the code of that one function. It is difficult to
            express what a blessed relief it is to be able to just naively read
            the code and assume that if it says "remove the id and then
            decrement the reliability" then both of those effects will happen
            atomically, and it will not make any difference which order you do
            them in, and the data will not unexpectedly change between the first
            event and the second.
            <br />

            <br />
            Anyway, when I started out to write this note I just wanted to
            emphasize to you that for me, using Python, switching from
            multithreaded to event-based was relatively painless. I've also had
            to do the same in some C code recently and it was a lot more hassle
            in C.

            I'm coming into this late and with only a partial comment, but
            another approach is coroutines (a special case of continuations).
            Coroutines feel like threads but are non-preemptive like events.
            Python generators are themselves a special case of coroutines and
            Stackless Python has [had?] coroutines and continuations (although
            theirs seems a little more obtuse than I think it should be).
            <br />

            <br />
            As an example application, SimPy uses generators in a "coroutine
            like" fashion for creating dozens or hundreds of "threads of
            execution". The code for the each "thread" is straightforward and
            linear, normal Python methods.
