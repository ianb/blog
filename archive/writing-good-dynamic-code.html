                (I've corrected the obvious non-Pythonness of the original code,
                since that wasn't the point.) The author is unhappy that he
                doesn't know the value (i.e. implementation) of
                <tt class="docutils literal"
                    ><span class="pre">channel.isValid</span></tt

                <tt class="docutils literal"
                    ><span class="pre">msg.body</span></tt
                >
                and
                <tt class="docutils literal"
                    ><span class="pre">channel.send</span></tt
                >. If he knew the type of
                <tt class="docutils literal"
                    ><span class="pre">channel</span></tt
                >
                and
                <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">msg</span></tt>
                he would know these things. And realistically these types are
                going to be relatively static, but you can't tell from a
                localized snippet of code. (Note that type inference doesn't
                help here at all, since with inference the types will be just as
                mysterious from simple code reading.)
            </p>
            <p>
                The problem here is that the code has a language of its own. It
                talks about things like &quot;channels&quot; and
                &quot;messages&quot; without specifying what exactly it means.
                These terms probably are all over the code. And once you become
                familiar with the code base it is probably obvious what they
                mean, and tedious to constantly describe them.
            </p>
            <p>
                This is a common situation in frameworks, though in this case
                the &quot;framework&quot; might simply be the rest of the code
                in the application outside of the module or function you are
                looking at.
            </p>
            <p>
                It's often a very good tradeoff to ask the programmer new to
                your code to spend some time familiarizing him or herself with
                the lay of the land -- the basic ideas that are pervasive in
                your application, the objects that form the core of it, the
                words you use to describe its process.
            </p>
            <p>
                Generally in Python (and elsewhere) we lack good conventions for
                doing this. Extracted documentation (ala Javadoc) is horrible
                for this; doctests aren't much better. Interfaces are generally
                quite good, if you separate the important interfaces from the
                incidental ones. Narratives and code maps are usually the best.
                But they often not present, or incomplete, or hidden, or not
                trustworthy. (Even when documentation is <em>true</em> it may
                still not be <em>trustworthy</em>.)
            </p>
            <p>
                We (meaning &quot;we programmers&quot;) should try to do better
                here. We should also be careful about the tradeoff -- adding new
                fundamental ideas to your code can be a great way to increase
                the expressiveness and cohesiveness of the code. But it also has
                a very real cost; it should not be done lightly. It is often
                better to repeat oneself than to introduce a new metaprogramming
                construct, a new object type, a subtle polymorphism, or use
                higher-level functions. I know, it feels cool to do all these
                things. It makes higher level languages seem justified -- if you
                are writing code that looks like C, why not write C? It lets you
                keep from repeating yourself. But it's often not worth it. It's
                often better to repeat yourself, to write dumb imperative code,
                to use short statements instead of long expressions, to add
                extra names to your code, to use lots of vertical space, to use
                a for loop, to use fundamental types over custom types, to avoid
                subclassing, to reimplement instead of generalize, to calculate
                eagerly instead of lazily, to bind tightly instead of loosely,
                to use functions over methods... all the things that are so
                often called bad are usually good, because they are usually
                easy. People overstate their case on these matters because it is
                hard to keep other people from doing the easy thing when it
                <em>is</em> the wrong thing. But programming-in-the-small (one
                function, one line, one simple routine) is best done in the easy
                way, even if it isn't as exciting.

                    While it's always been true that the man with only a hammer
                    sees all problems as nails, the man with a toolbag
                    containing a rich collection of function and object-oriented
                    tools can have a tendency to see even the simplest problems
                    as excuses to write a meta-framework that will never be used
                    in any other context.

                    Or, as people have been saying for a long time now, and in a

                    This is especially important if we want to enourage much

                    some posts, including the one you mention. But I had read it
                    earlier, and I also raised an eyebrow when he illustrated
                    the &quot;correct&quot; way to write code, which to me just
                    seemed to use slightly longer expression chains with
                    identifier names that i guess were supposed to be more
                    descriptive (they were talking about chess pieces or
                    something). but there was nothing clearer about it at all,
                    if you didnt know <em>those</em> particular names...it did
                    not illustrate any advantage inherent in erlang that couldnt
                    be true for python or most any other language as well.
                </p>
                <p>
                    anyway ++1 on every point you made. when writing code that
                    is to be consumed by others, you have to question every
                    little trick and shortcut you think is cool and/or
                    convenient and insure it has a proper and consistent place
                    in the overall concept. I also try to focus on
                    &quot;narrative&quot; style documentation...since API docs
                    dont say much by themselves. though I do receive some
                    complaints that illustration through example is
                    &quot;inaccurate&quot;.

                    However, terse-ness has merit in efficiency. We use
                    shortcuts in language all the time. Idioms, contractions
                    (not sure if that's the proper name), et al.
                </p>
                <p>
                    While I agree with the KISS paradigm, sometimes I feel it's
                    getting taken too far in the web-development space. I have
                    no evidence to form an argument, but I do wonder if coding
                    for this level of read-ability will lead to &quot;picture
                    book&quot; code -- code that is overly-simplified to the
                    point of being a hindrance to efficiency.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Maybe I don't have experiences where using OO and
                    &quot;high-level&quot; concepts has been a hindrance, but I
                    do believe that the benefits out-weigh the cost when
                    everyone understands the concepts. I believe there is a
                    sweet-spot of balance between writing complex code
                    efficiently and elegantly while still being readable and
                    maintainable.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Extreme terseness can lead to obfu, but extreme verbosity
                    can also have the same effects on maintenance AFAIK.
                </p>
                <p>It might also be a matter of preference.</p>
                <p>
                    Interesting article -- good argument, but I think coding
                    this way is too extreme. Or perhaps I am simply still too
                    perl-ish for the python world, I dunno.
