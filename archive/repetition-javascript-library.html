        <h1>Repetition Javascript Library</h1>

        <div class="document">
            <p>
                <a class="reference" href="http://imagescape.com"
                    >Imaginary Landscape</a
                >
                open-sourced some work I did recently on a Javascript library
                for handling repeating elements in forms. I've rewritten it more
                than once since then, and might just rewrite it again before it
                settles down.
            </p>
            <p>
                After the last rewrite it more-or-less follows the
                <a
                    class="reference"
                    href="http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-forms/current-work/#repeatingFormControls"
                    >WHAT-WG Web Forms 2.0</a
                >
                spec with respect to repeating forms. The implementation
                practically falls out of the spec, so after I just read it
                closely it was pretty clear how to implement it. Though, having
                implemented it, I need to bring some questions back to the
                WHAT-WG group -- especially related to moving repetition blocks
                around.
            </p>
            <p>
                Conveniently, the spec works very well with
                <a class="reference" href="http://formencode.org">FormEncode</a>
                and
                <a
                    class="reference"
                    href="http://svn.colorstudy.com/FormEncode/trunk/formencode/variabledecode.py"
                    >variabledecode</a
                >
                in particular. But it's actually expedience that made me
                implement it in the first place. Without repeating form
                elements, you have to have multiple complex forms, with lots of
                add/edit/delete functionality. With repeating forms you just
                have a single form, and the update is a single HTTP request.
                Less templates, less things to explain, less controllers, and a
                better user experience to boot.
            </p>
            <p>
                I still have to figure out where this will go. I like
                <a class="reference" href="http://mochikit.com">MochiKit</a>,
                but I've ended up factoring out nearly all the MochiKit
                dependencies (not because I was trying, it just happened). And
                it also fits a somewhat different style -- the Javascript is
                largely implicit, based on declarative HTML as defined in the
                spec. A big feature of the Web Forms 2.0 spec (IMHO) is that it
                <em>isn't</em> expressed in Javascript, and you don't have to
                think about Javascript while using it.
            </p>
            <p>
                OTOH, I have no desire to set up a separate project or deal with
                any of that. I'd much rather glom onto someone else's project ;)
            </p>
            <p>
                I've seen other implementations of portions of WHAT-WG. But they
                all seem complicated, or tied to one browser. (Well, I haven't
                tested on IE yet, but that's incidental.) That seems
                unnecessary, because at least large portions of Web Forms 2.0 is
                pretty simple Javascript. Plus I have a hard time finding them.

                    fyi, I just tried out your demo page and it doesn't work at
                    all in ie. Not sure if you're aware of this, so I thought
                    I'd point it out :).

                        Indeed; I just fixed some of the most obvious problems.
                        It seems that IE returns properties as Attributes,
                        including bound functions. Also there's no
                        .hasAttribute() method. I'm still crashing IE when I add
                        multiple moons, I'll have to look into that some more.
                        Some sort of loop problem, I'm guessing.

                <p>
                    One thing I didn't quite get about this spec was : how do
                    you work out reordering on the serverside? Do they expect
                    the order in the POST or query string to be
                    preserved/examined?
                </p>
                <p>
                    Maybe it needs an event so it is possible to twiddle with a
                    hidden field on reorder or something.

                        The spec does specify events, which this library doesn't
                        do -- I don't understand Javascript events that much at
                        the moment. I actually followed this post up with a

                        where I mention this problem. Hopefully some resolution
                        will come up for this; though as I was writing it
                        occurred to me that it's not too hard to fix by putting
                        in a field like this in the template:
                    </p>
                    <pre class="literal-block">
&lt;div repeat=&quot;template&quot; id=&quot;foo&quot;&gt;
  &lt;input type=&quot;hidden&quot; name=&quot;foo-order&quot; value=&quot;[foo]&quot;&gt;
  ...
&lt;/div&gt;
</pre
                    >
                    <p>
                        Then
                        <tt class="docutils literal"
                            ><span class="pre">foo-order</span></tt
                        >
                        will contain an ordered list of the indexes -- the spec
                        specifically indicates that <em>all</em> attributes are
                        substituted, not just input names. So if you don't think
                        of index as representing order -- just some relatedness
                        -- it's not so bad. I think this is a reasonable way to
                        handle it, the more I think about it, and it's
                        definitely something I can add to
                        <tt class="docutils literal"
                            ><span class="pre">variable_decode</span></tt

                        (so it orders the lists for you).

                    Javascript is not just for web. MochiKit has some real
                    potential for things like string formatting functions.

                <p>
                    Does your work have some generic usefullness, as well. I
                    mean usefull for things outside of the web world, also.

                        This library? No, I don't think so -- it's very closely
                        tied to the DOM, and HTML forms. I suspect XForms
                        already has functionality like this built into the spec.
                        This just happens to work today, unlike XForms. I have
                        no idea what Flash programming is like, but I assume
                        they also don't have something similar enough to the DOM
                        for this to matter.

                            Well... I really did not expect this library to be
                            useful in this context. However, I guess what I am
                            really wishing for is some general usable runtime
                            functions used to create these javascript things.
                            You see, Javascript is now showing up everywhere.
                            It's easy to embed SpiderMonkey or WebKit's
                            version... And there does not seem to be many
                            libraries out there which help in doing basic
                            operations. Instead, Javascript coders keep
                            rewriting the same code over and over. When I saw
                            MochiKit I had/have high hopes of abstracting out
                            the generally usefull methods. Likewise, it would be
                            helpful if the Repetition Javasript library used
                            some abstraction between the web stuff which I do
                            not know and some generally usefull Javascript
                            methods.

                            out there but have not have had the time to look and
                            unsure if any exists of this quality.

                                MochiKit could certainly be used in those other
                                contexts; the only difficulty might be the
                                packaging and loading system, which is quirky in
                                Javascript, and what tools that do exist are
                                usually tied closely to their environment, e.g.,
                                a web browser. But MochiKit's things like
                                iteration, adaptation, comparisons, etc., are
                                all core Javascript things with no relation to
                                the web.

                                    MochiKit will eventually end up getting
                                    refactored and tested such that it works in
                                    some non-browser environments, but that's
                                    not an immediate plan of mine -- unless I
                                    end up writing Yet Another Goddamned
                                    JavaScript Unit-Testing Library.

                                    Test.Simple is OK, but the implementation is
                                    ugly, non-portable, and could behave better
                                    in Safari. I could do better, but I really
                                    need to look at what Dojo is doing first as
                                    they also have their own unit test library.
