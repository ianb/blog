</div><h1>Big Blocks</h1>
 
<div class="document">
<p>When I was a child I had a friend with custom lego-like blocks, maybe
4&quot;x6&quot;x12&quot;in or so.  They were pretty cool, but never enough to really
satisfy me.  Seeing some legos on TV, I remembered those blocks, and a
do-it-yourself idea occurred to me.</p>
<p>You can get different kind of large building blocks.  <a class="reference" href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00005ICC4/emilymurphymostl">ImagiBricks</a>
(<a class="reference" href="http://edushop.edu4kids.com/catalog/product_info.php?products_id=1173">also here</a>) are the classic cardboard building blocks you'll find
in finer daycare establishments; <a class="reference" href="http://www.mtm-kidzstore.com/Merchant2/merchant.mvc?Screen=PROD&amp;Store_Code=MK&amp;Product_Code=4196">Little Tyke</a> building blocks are
nice and rounded, and look sturdy; <a class="reference" href="http://www.target.com/gp/detail.html/602-3373569-8882203?asin=B0001YNI04&amp;AFID=Shopping&amp;ref=tgt_adv_XSC10001">Chicco Maxi Modo</a> blocks look
like giant Legos, as do <a class="reference" href="http://store.yahoo.com/brandsplace/0222-8060x6.html">EduShape Edu Blocks</a> (but fancier), and the
<a class="reference" href="http://www.creativityinstitute.com/index.asp?PageAction=VIEWCATS&amp;Category=34">Children's Factory Soft Blocks</a> look like fun pillows; <a class="reference" href="http://kvm.kvcc.edu/content/preschools/waffleblocks.htm">Waffle
Blocks</a> seem like easy ways to build larger structures, the
<a class="reference" href="http://www.forkidzonly.com/blockplay/plastic5.htm">EduBlock</a> seems particularly sturdy, and the <a class="reference" href="http://www.forkidzonly.com/blockplay/plastic.html">Dusyma</a> blocks look
pretty neat too.</p>
<p>But I enjoy making things, so what if you just buy a bunch of
cardboard boxes and make it yourself?  And to make them a little more
fun, add some velcro so they stick together?  So here's the supplies I
might imagine getting (all in inches):</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>25 (1 bundle) of <a class="reference" href="http://www.uline.com/ProductDetail.asp?model=S-4876">6x6x6 boxes</a> (heavy duty): $8.00</li>
<li>75 (3 bundles) of <a class="reference" href="http://www.uline.com/ProductDetail.asp?model=S-4784">12x6x6 boxes</a> (heavy duty): $32.25</li>
<li>25 (1 bundle) of <a class="reference" href="http://www.uline.com/ProductDetail.asp?model=S-4240">24x6x6 boxes</a>: $10.75</li>
<li>box shipping: $23</li>
<li>1 roll of 1/2inch <a class="reference" href="http://www.fastenation.com/cartSpecify.tmpl?id=332">velcro dots</a> (1440 dots; you need about 1100):
$67.00 ($59+$8s/h)</li>
</ul>
<p>Total: $141.00</p>
<p>Well, it's not that cheap; about $1 a block, with shipping, which is 
only slightly cheaper than ImagiBricks (though the boxes are larger and
include velcro).  And you
have to assemble them and add dots.  You can draw on them, but they
are brown; white boxes aren't available in the full variety of sizes.
And they aren't water resistent like the ImagiBrics (which have a
glossy surface), and I think Imagiblocks may have an internal
structure making them stronger.  And it takes 34 cubic feet to store
the boxes, about a 4x4x2 foot area.  You could enclose a 4x4x4 foot
house-like structure with them.  And of course you could leave some
unassembled as replacements.</p>
<p>So, I'm not sure if it's the best do-it-yourself idea.  But I'm sure the
kids would have fun.</p>
