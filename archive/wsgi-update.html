</div><h1>WSGI</h1>
 
<div class="document">
<p>Things in WSGI-land have been going well lately, I think.  Paste is
<a class="reference" href="paste-1-0.html">at 1.0</a> and doing fine
there.  <a class="reference" href="http://pylonshq.com/">Pylons</a> has been gaining in
popularity, and it's been doing really well as a traditional and
familiar framework on the outside, but with WSGI just under the skin.
It's been a compelling introduction to WSGI for many people.  Other
WSGI-based frameworks have been appearing; I especially like niche
frameworks like <a class="reference" href="http://bitworking.org/news/wsgicollection">wsgicollection</a> because they wouldn't be
viable frameworks at all if they had to stand on their own.  But with
WSGI you really can just solve <em>one</em> problem, and not worry about <em>all
possible</em> problems.</p>
<p>There's been <a class="reference" href="http://wsgi.org/wsgi/Learn_WSGI">several recent articles</a> on WSGI.  I'm never sure how WSGI
should really be presented -- on one level it's an implementation
detail of higher-level frameworks.  Creating WSGI middleware and
dispatchers and whatnot is not terribly advanced, and is genuinely
useful even if you aren't inclined to write your own framework from
scratch, but it's not a prerequesite to getting things done in
WSGI-based environments.  But WSGI's success will definitely rely on
the community of people that feel comfortable with both the details
and the architecture of these systems, so building wide familiarity is
important.  I've personally come to believe that talking about the
architecture of WSGI is more important than the details (which are
easy enough to pick up if you are motivated).</p>
<p>I started talking about more standards on <a class="reference" href="http://www.python.org/community/sigs/current/web-sig/">Web-SIG</a>.  Python is
ripe for new standards in lots of areas, and WSGI stacks are among
them.  The <a class="reference" href="http://wsgi.org/wsgi/Specifications/routing_args">first proposal</a> I introduced just
because it seemed like low-hanging fruit, but people seemed to really
like it.  I guess it's not surprise that low-hanging fruit is usually
the best stuff to pick.  The proposal describes an environment key
(<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">wsgiorg.routing_args</span></tt>) that dispatchers can use to store captured
information.  In the process we discussed a fairly light process for
introducing and accepting proposals, centered now on a <a class="reference" href="http://wsgi.org/wsgi/Specifications">wsgi.org page</a>.  I also added a bunch of
ideas for specs to the bottom of that page; so if you see one you are
thinking about yourself, now you know someone else is thinking about
it too.</p>
<p>In my own coding, I've been working on <a class="reference" href="http://pythonpaste.org/wsgiremote/">WSGIRemote</a>, which is a library to help
with making subrequests, both external requests and what should be
very fast internal requests (not that I've benchmarked anything).
This should make apps using REST internally more manageable -- they
should scale <em>down</em> a lot further, requiring less setup and less
general overhead.  Of course the performance characteristics will
change a lot when you actually move services to other processes or
servers, but I'm more concerned with manageability at this point.  A
lot of the tools in Paste (and <a class="reference" href="http://pythonpaste.org/deploy/">Paste Deploy</a>) are about managing lots of small
pieces without letting that turn into external complexity.  One aspect
of this is to let applications self-provide the services they need,
because most of the time simple internal implementations of an API
will be sufficient.  Turning a Python library into a service is kind
of like adding another level of formality to it; and I think more
formality is useful as we try to share pieces of code.</p>
<p>Another earlier-stage project is <a class="reference" href="http://pythonpaste.org/wsgifilter/">WSGIFilter</a>, perhaps notably one of the
only frameworks for building WSGI <em>middleware</em>.  It's not a very big
framework, to be sure (it's really just the <a class="reference" href="http://svn.pythonpaste.org/Paste/WSGIFilter/trunk/wsgifilter/filter.py">one file</a>)
but it should help implement output filtering in WSGI, which can be
really tricky.</p>
<p>WSGI development can seem kind of plodding at times, because we're
building up slowly from a low-level foundation.  But as the tools
emerge they work together really well; I think we're starting to see
real returns from that process.  If there was a motto for using these
WSGI tools together, it might be <em>making large problems smaller</em> --
it's not doing much <em>for</em> you, it's not fancy or magic, things like
&quot;convention over configuration&quot; don't even <em>mean</em> anything on this
level, it's not code or a framework, it's just an idea and an
architecture.  Describing what that really means remains a challenge.</p>
