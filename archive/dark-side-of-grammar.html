                    >grammar quiz</a
                >, and I was reminded of an article I had just read,
                <a
                    class="reference"
                    href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/usa/story/0,12271,1033904,00.html"

                <p>
                    Soon after arriving [at Andover, a boarding school?] he was
                    asked to write an essay on a soul-stirring experience in his
                    life to date; he chose the death of his sister. his mother
                    had drilled into him that it was wrong when writing to
                    repeat words already used. Having employed &quot;tears&quot;
                    once in the essay, he sought a substitute from a thesaurus
                    and wrote &quot;the lacerates ran down my cheeks.&quot; The
                    essay received a failing grade, accompanied by comments like
                    &quot;disgraceful.&quot;
                </p>
                <p>
                    This incident may be an insight into Bush's strange tendency
                    to find the wrong words in making public pronouncements. (He
                    once famously declared that critics of his intellect had
                    &quot;misunderestimated&quot; him.) Perhaps these verbal
                    faux-pas are a barely unconscious way of winding up his
                    bullying mother and waving two middle fingers at his
                    cultured father's sensibility.

                The article then continues to dissect W. psychologically, which
                is a much more disturbing portrait than merely W. as a buffoon.
                I feel there's some message in this, maybe
                <em
                    >don't correct your child's grammar or you may create a
                    monster</em
                >, though obviously that's a small part of the whole picture.
