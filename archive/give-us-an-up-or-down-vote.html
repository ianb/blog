                    I really don't know weather I support the idea of a national
                    ID card yet, but both Democrats and Republicans vowed to
                    take action based on the 911 Commission's report, which
                    included a recommendation for a national ID card. The
                    Republican's didn't come up with this idea! This is not a
                    Bush scheme, just the result of a promise to take the
                    recommendations of the 911 commission seriously.

                    The reason it's in the spending bill for the military is
                    because the Democrats didn't want it as part of the bill to
                    appoint a national director of intelligence. To get a
                    concession they struck a deal with Republicans by allowing
                    it to be included in the next must-pass piece of
                    legislation.

                        I would have been against it anyway on principle, but I
                        think this analysis makes it clearer that the purported
                        reasons and security gains are not correct.
