                        for the keys inside them. Lastly, parenthesis can be

                <li>
                    Add some more converters, like a string converter that

                    I ran into the same issue. In my config format, I found that
                    I never needed a depth greater than 2, so the following
                    works pretty well (as a method of the Application object):

                <pre class="literal-block">
def config(self, branch=None, leaf=None, default={}):
    &quot;&quot;&quot;config([branch], [leaf], default={}) -&gt; tree, branch, or leaf.

    If branch is not specified, the entire config dict is returned.
    If branch is specified, but leaf is not, the requested branch
        is returned (or default if it does not exist).
    If branch and leaf are specified, the leaf value is returned (or
        default if either the branch or leaf does not exist).

    In the case where either branch or leaf are not found, the config
    tree is not modified--you simply get back empty or default values.
    &quot;&quot;&quot;
    if branch is None:
        return self._config
    if leaf is None:
        return self._config.get(branch, default)
    return self._config.get(branch, {}).get(leaf, default)
