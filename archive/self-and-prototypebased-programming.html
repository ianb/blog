        <h1>Self and Prototype-based Programming</h1>
        <p>
            When comparing languages, I often feel that Python is closer to
            <a href="http://research.sun.com/research/self/">Self</a> than
            Smalltalk. I was reminded of that again with
            <a
                href="http://zephyrfalcon.org/weblog/arch_d7_2003_09_13.html#e343"
                >this blog entry</a
            >
            by Hans Nowak. Python <i>has</i> classes, but Self had classes too,
            even if they weren't part of the core language. Python classes are
            just a pattern of object creation, and a syntax to go with it.
            Python is entirely <i>concrete</i>. Classes aren't strongly named
            (at least not enough to allow
            <a href="http://blog.colorstudy.com/ianb/weblog/2003/09/15.html#P6"
                >reloading</a
            >). They aren't global. They have a special syntax for definition,
            but none for instantiation. Python almost goes out of its way to
            keep you from overemphasizing instantiation by making it an
            innocuous call, identical to a function or method call.
        </p>

        <p>
            So it's not that hard to do Self-like things in Python. A simple
            pattern I've been using feels this way to me:
        </p>

        <pre>
class SelfLike(object):

    def __init__(self, **kw):
        for name, value in kw.items():
            setattr(self, name, value)

    def __call__(self, **kw):
        if not kw: return self
        newdict = self.__dict__.copy()
        newdict.update(kw)
        return self.__class__(**newdict)
</pre
        >

        <p>
            Then, when using <tt>SelfLike</tt> objects I usually call them right
            away, so that classes can be used in the place of instances. A
            metaclass solution would probably be even more elegant, but I
            haven't figured out quite how that would work -- the metaclass could
            return an instance, but how could you inherit from an instance?
        </p>

        <p>
            I've been using this pattern in places where people often use
            configuration files. It allows both a brief or longwinded way of
            specifying some interface, for instance. For instance (taken from
            <a
                href="http://cvs.sourceforge.net/viewcvs.py/webware-sandbox/Sandbox/ianbicking/FormEncode/"
                >FormEncode</a
            >:
        </p>

        <pre>
class FullName(Schema):
    firstName = String(notEmpty=True)
    lastName = String(notEmpty=True)
    mi = String(maxLength=1)

# Equivalent to:
NotEmpty = String(notEmpty=True)
FullName = Schema(firstName=NotEmpty, lastName=NotEmpty,
                  mi=String(maxLength=1))

# Equivalent to:
class FullName(Schema):
    class firstName(String):
        notEmpty = True
    class lastName(String):
        notEmpty = True
    class mi(String):
        maxLength = 1
</pre
        >

        <p>
            Especially as these become nested (e.g., an address that includes a
            <tt>FullName</tt> entry) the class syntax can be a useful way to
            organize all the settings. But you can also express things very
            briefly, like <tt>age = Int</tt>. And specifying a single field can
            turn into a category of specifications that can be reused and
            further specialized, like <tt>NotEmpty</tt>.
        </p>

        <p>
            Unfortunately, the simple <tt>SelfLike</tt> pattern doesn't quite
            live up to this. You can't inherit from <tt>NotEmpty</tt> in this
            example, because it is an instance, not a subclass of
            <tt>String</tt>. Perhaps this calls for a metaclass that implemented
            __call__ to create a subclass instead of creating an instance, and
            then turns all methods into class methods [<a
                href="https://ianbicking.org/software/self_like.py"
                >code</a
            >]:
        </p>

        <pre>
from types import MethodType

class SelfLikeMeta(type):

    def __call__(cls, **kw):
        newdict = cls.__dict__.copy()
        newdict.update(kw)
        return SelfLikeMeta('Anonymous%s' % cls.__name__,
                            (cls,), newdict)

    def __getattribute__(cls, attr):
        v = type.__getattribute__(cls, attr)
        if type(v) is MethodType:
            # Here we turn instance methods to class methods:
            def newv(*args, **kw):
                return v.im_func(cls, *args, **kw)
            return newv
        return v

class Test(object):
    __metaclass__ = SelfLikeMeta
    value1 = 'from Test'
Test2 = Test(value1='from Test2')
# Doesn't have a real name, unfortunately:
print repr(Test2)
# >>>
class Test3(Test2):
    def returnValue(self):
        return self.value1
print Test.value1
# >>> from Test
print Test2.value1
# >>> from Test2
print Test3.returnValue()
# >>> from Test2
</pre
        >

        <p>
            Unfortunately it breaks some new-style features, like properties. It
            will take some thought to figure out just how those features should
            interact with this (distorted) class/instance fuzzy system.

            But, Guido said it's not a prototype based language.

            I've had a lot of fun with
            <a href="http://iolanguage.com" target="_blank">Io</a>, a
            prototype-oriented language that reminds me of Self on its good
            days; I would love to use a more prototype-based metaphor for
            programming in Python, but Python really hasn't had any good
            facilities for writing anonymous functions for assignment. This
            makes it difficult to incrementally expand the functionality of a
            prototype.
            <br />

            <br />
            Simply copying the dictionary from one object to another also won't
            permit a derived instance from picking up the addition of new
            attributes to its prototype. An override of the getattr method that
            would check the local dictionary for an item, then proceed to
            checking the prototype, would be a bit better for this.

            Scott: in some new thinking along these lines I've used classes
            instead of instances, and __call__ creates a new anonymous class.
            This way you get the parent/child relationship. I haven't tested the
            performance of this -- it could mean a lot of new classes, and I
            don't know how fast that is compared to instance creation.
            <br />

            <br />
            The other issue with using classes is that you can't really
            <i>use</i> them. You really want to use a singleton associated with
            the class (which I create upon class creation). Unfortunately this
            is annoying. Maybe I could put a __getattr__ in the metaclass and
            delegate all the calls to the metaclass to the instance, but I don't
            know how well that will work.
