                didn't immediately install for me (such impatience). uTidyLib
                doesn't ship with any C code, but uses

                I thought that was clever. Then I looked at the actual code that
                does the interfacing; then I was <em>really</em> impressed: the
                entire interface to tidy is 216 lines long. It's not incredibly
                easy to understand -- it's glue code, after all -- but it's
                really not too bad. And it's so short!

            ctypes is pretty great, but caveat emptor..
            <br />
            (a) there's no automatic way to convert a C header to ctypes code
            <br />
            (b) some C-isms are terribly difficult to express in ctypes code
            <br />
            (c) debugging ctypes code is HARD
            <br />

            <br />
            pyrex still has (a), partially solves (b), and almost entirely
            solves (c).

            Where ctypes excels is deployment. It's very difficult to setup a
            build env. on w32 (see my docs on
            <a
                href="http://cvs.sourceforge.net/viewcvs.py/mnet/mnet_new/w32/BUILD.mingw?rev=1.1.1.1&view=auto"
                target="_blank"
                >building Mnet on w32</a
            >). For my ctypes based module I have one .py file, and the w32
            users can copy the DLL need to c:\windows\system32 and be off and
            running.

            For deployment you can just as easily offer a precompiled pyd. It
            only takes one correctly configured environment in order to target
            windows.
            <br />

            <br />
            FWIW, if you own VS.NET, it's easy to build on windows ;)

            I mostly agree with Bob's three points, although for me (a) is not
            that important. I mainly use it to call win32 apis, and I gave up to
            wrap windows header files automatically, after some experiments (I
            got most far parsing header files with Simon Burton's cdecl.py
            module). Automatic wrapping may be more sucessful for simpler header
            files, if someone wants to work on this and submit code I'm open.
            <br />

            <br />
            The ctypes.com package imo shows the real power of ctypes. And I
            don't want to fire up the C compiler for each and every new com
            interface I have to use. (Has anyone used pyrex to use com
            interfaces?)

            I think that Thomas uses APIs that take simple pointers and integers
            more often than I do ;) It seems that I have to write three or four
            lines of code, or more, per function call whenever I use ctypes..
            which puts it more or less on par with Pyrex.
            <br />

            <br />
            It's also half-broken on non-win32 platforms right now. Several
            important tests that should pass don't. This is where debugging is
            important. From gdb and pdb, it's REALLY hard to tell when and why
            it's ctypes fault.
            <br />

            <br />
            I do like to experiment with ctypes, but I'll be damned if I use it
            in a production app any time soon :)

            <hr noshade />
            Of course it's partly broken on non-win32. I only left the
            cross-platform code because some users wanted it, but nobody so far
            complained or provided patches. I've seen that you posted a patch
            now, so it can improve.
            <br />

            <br />
            I'll continue *this* discussion on the ctypes-users mailing list ;-)
