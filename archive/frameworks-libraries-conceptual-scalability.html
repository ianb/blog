                    class="reference"
                    href="http://www.softwareresearch.net/site/publications/J013.pdf"

                Framelets are small frameworks that can be used together. A
                framelet is (to quote):
            </p>
            <blockquote>
                <ul class="simple">
                    <li>is small in size ( &lt; 10 classes);</li>
                    <li>does not assume main control of an application; and</li>
                    <li>has a clearly defined simple interface.</li>
                </ul>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
                I don't like the term, but the concept is important. In the past
                I've talked about the distinction between a framework and a
                library, and this is the kind of thing I'm talking about, though
                I consider a library to be simpler than a mini-framework (I
                can't make myself use the term <em>framelet</em>, I just can't).
            </p>
            <p>
                The Python standard library is mostly made up of
                &quot;libraries&quot; as opposed to frameworks (though not
                entirely). I think of a library as:
            </p>
            <blockquote>
                <ul class="simple">
                    <li>Imperative; it does things.</li>
                    <li>
                        Public interface made up of functions and
                        <em>maybe</em> a small number of classes (maybe one or
                        two). Internally it may use more.
                    </li>
                    <li>Users do not subclass anything.</li>
                </ul>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
                Examples are things like
                <a
                    class="reference"
                    href="http://python.org/doc/current/lib/module-pickle.html"
                    >pickle</a
                >,
                <a
                    class="reference"
                    href="http://python.org/doc/current/lib/module-shelve.html"
                    >shelve</a
                >,
                <a
                    class="reference"
                    href="http://python.org/doc/current/lib/module-urllib.html"
                    >urllib</a
                >,
                <span class="nowiki"
                    >csv<a
                        class="wiki reference"
                        href="https://ianbicking.org/csv.html"
                        >?</a
                    ></span
                >, etc. Even
                <a
                    class="reference"
                    href="http://python.org/doc/current/lib/module-logging.html"
                    >logging</a

                is more a library than a framework, despite its complexity.
            </p>
            <p>
                It also has some more mini-framework modules, like
                <a
                    class="reference"
                    href="http://python.org/doc/current/lib/module-HTMLParser.html"
                    >HTMLParser</a
                >,
                <a
                    class="reference"
                    href="http://python.org/doc/current/lib/module-threading.html"
                    >threading</a
                >,
                <a
                    class="reference"
                    href="http://python.org/doc/current/lib/module-urllib2.html"
                    >urllib2</a
                >, and
                <a
                    class="reference"
                    href="http://python.org/doc/current/lib/module-asyncore.html"
                    >asyncore</a
                >.
            </p>
            <p>
                Generally when I work with these mini-frameworks I have to look
                up the documentation each time. I still can't remember quite how
                to spawn threads, even though I've written code to do so many
                times -- the actual subset of the interface I use is simple
                enough, but I'm always distracted. And urllib2 has annoyed me
                many times in the past, because things that should be simple are
                not -- the excuse is that you <em>can</em> do anything with
                urllib2 by subclassing various pieces, but I think it's wrong
                that you should subclass anything that could be easily expected
                (like HTTP authentication). [John Lee has been making good
                progress on some
                <a class="reference" href="http://wwwsearch.sourceforge.net/"
                    >improved interfaces</a
                >
                for client web usage, though.]
            </p>
            <p>
                Still, the mini-frameworks in the standard library are generally
                easier to deal with than larger frameworks -- they are
                relatively generic and can usually be distilled into a
                application-specific library-like interface. For instance, if I
                use HTMLParser I immediately make a function-based interface to
                do the specific parsing or transformation I need for my
                application.
            </p>
            <p>
                It's still a challenge -- how do you make something that is easy
                to start with, but complete and generic enough to grow with your
                application? The old
                <em>make easy problems easy, and hard problems possible</em>.
            </p>
            <p>
                I've decided to make this the more general topic of my talk on
                <a class="reference" href="http://formencode.org">FormEncode</a>
                at

                    >PyCon</a
                >, describing some of the design decisions I've made in
                FormEncode to try to make that particular framework both easy to
                use and complete.
