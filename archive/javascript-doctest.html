                Since I'm thinking about writing a Javascript Logo, I decided I
                needed a good test framework. I was happy with my hack to use
                Python's
                <a
                    class="reference"
                    href="http://python.org/doc/current/lib/module-doctest.html"
                    >doctest</a
                >
                for testing Logo, so I thought I'd try to use doctest style
                testing in this project too.
            </p>
            <p>
                I haven't started on the Logo part yet, but I did write a
                Javascript doctest runner. It uses MochiKit, located at
                <a
                    class="reference"
                    href="http://svn.colorstudy.com/doctestjs/trunk/"
                    >http://svn.colorstudy.com/doctestjs/trunk/</a
                >
                -- but more interesting is the
                <a
                    class="reference"
                    href="http://svn.colorstudy.com/doctestjs/trunk/docs/index.html"
                    >demo</a
                >.
            </p>
            <p>
                Python has oodles of different ways to do testing; but if there
                was one kind of testing I'd want to port to other systems from
                that the diversity of projects, it'd be doctest. Especially for
                an environment like Javascript where the lightness of the system
                is more important than organization. So I'm fairly pleased with
                how this feels so far, even though I haven't yet used it much.

                    &quot;...but if there was one kind of testing I'd take away
                    from that diversity of projects, it'd be doctest.&quot;

                    That sounds like you want to eliminate doctest from Python's
                    list of available testing modules. I had to re-read that
                    phrase three times before I realized what you really meant:
                    doctest is unique and special among Python testing
                    libraries.
