        <div class="document">
            <p>
                Yesterday was kind of fun; I spent the whole day programming,
                with a clear direction and lots of forward movement. It's always
                very satisfying when that happens.
            </p>
            <p>
                Of course, I was really just distracting myself, tweaking out a
                form that didn't need to be tweaked out. I was doing it
                primarily in Javascript, and was using the
                <a
                    class="reference"
                    href="http://bob.pythonmac.org/archives/category/javascript/mochikit/"
                    >MochiKit</a
                >
                library some; though unfortunately that library didn't help me a
                great deal, and I had to avoid spending the day simply creating
                enhancements to it because that really <em>would</em> be a total
                distraction. I'd probably have gotten by fine with a couple bits
                of DOM traversal code.
            </p>
            <p>
                What I ended up spending my time on was a little Javascript
                validation and repeating fields library. About half-way through
                I realized I was implementing bits of
                <a
                    class="reference"
                    href="http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-forms/2005-04-11-call-for-comments/#repeatingFormControls"
                    >the WHAT-WG Web Form spec</a
                >
                (though with different names). Which is a good sign all around,
                I suppose. For instance, for repeating fields I could write:
            </p>
            <pre class="literal-block">
&lt;tr class=&quot;form-template&quot; form-group=&quot;urlmap&quot;&gt;
 &lt;td class=&quot;field&quot;&gt;URLMap:&lt;/td&gt;
 &lt;td&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;text&quot; template-name=&quot;urlmap-${number}.path&quot;
      style=&quot;width: 30%&quot; title=&quot;path&quot;&gt;:
     &lt;input type=&quot;text&quot; template-name=&quot;urlmap-${number}.url&quot;
      style=&quot;width: 60%&quot; title=&quot;URL&quot; value=&quot;http://&quot;&gt;
     &lt;button form-delete=&quot;1&quot;&gt;-&lt;/button&gt;
 &lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr class=&quot;add-button&quot; id=&quot;urlmap-before&quot;&gt;
 &lt;td colspan=2&gt;
   &lt;button form-add=&quot;urlmap&quot; form-before=&quot;urlmap-before&quot;&gt;
     Add URL Map
   &lt;/button&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
</pre
            >
            <p>
                Basically I look for elements with a
                <tt class="docutils literal"
                    ><span class="pre">form-template</span></tt
                >
                class (Web Forms uses a
                <tt class="docutils literal"
                    ><span class="pre">template</span></tt
                >
                attribute), and collect them (they are also hidden by CSS). And
                I look for buttons with a
                <tt class="docutils literal"
                    ><span class="pre">form-add</span></tt
                >
                (Web Forms uses
                <tt class="docutils literal"
                    ><span class="pre">type=&quot;add&quot;</span></tt
                >) and add onclick handlers for them. Then when you hit the
                button it clones the template and substitutes
                <tt class="docutils literal"
                    ><span class="pre">${number}</span></tt
                >
                with next next highest index (Web Forms uses
                <tt class="docutils literal"
                    ><span class="pre">[urlmap]</span></tt
                >). Oh, and detect the buttons with
                <tt class="docutils literal"
                    ><span class="pre">form-delete</span></tt
                >
                attributes and set their onclick handlers to delete their
                enclosing row (Web Forms uses
                <tt class="docutils literal"
                    ><span class="pre">type=&quot;remove&quot;</span></tt
                >).
            </p>
            <p>
                It works pretty nicely, and the resulting fields can be unpacked
                into a nice nested structure by
                <a
                    class="reference"
                    href="http://svn.colorstudy.com/FormEncode/trunk/formencode/variabledecode.py"
                    >variabledecode</a
                >.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the past I've looked at Web Forms longingly, but haven't been
                able to find a reference Javascript implementation (despite a
                Javascript implementation being central to WHAT-WG's strategy).
                This code wasn't particularly hard to write -- lots of boring
                looping (Javascript looping SUCKS!) and a few little quirks
                (Gecko doesn't like you to make up your own tags). At some point
                I'll probably convert it to use Web Form's specs exactly.
