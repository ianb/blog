        <h1>Ah, for a decent bit of Javascript!</h1>
        <p>
            I'm still at the stage where I don't go writing my own Javascript --
            maybe modifying someone else's, but I don't trust myself to write it
            from scratch. Mostly because of the cross-browser issues.
        </p>

        <p>
            But now I'm looking for something that should be simple, but I can't
            find it -- a simple drop-down menu that <i>isn't</i> a flyover.
            There's a ton of flyover menus, despite flyovers being obnoxious.
            It's probably only the tiniest modification to change those menus to
            require a click, but lack the confidence.
        </p>

        <p>
            Where do people go to find good Javascript? There's a fair amount of
            fair-to-middling (or maybe just middling-to-mediocre) Javascript out
            there, but so far nothing seems both good and comprehensive. I'd
            love to see a real open source library, using the kind of
            infrastructure and development techniques typical for open source
            projects.
        </p>

            And what about a CSS menu ? I hacked one for XMLObject's website.

            oops the menu I have is a flyover one. Not really what you're
            looking for

            The BrainJar code looks just right, thanks! (Why does every bit of
            JS code turn into a freaking multi-page recipe, though?)

            I think you know the answer to this.

            If you're interested in learning more about cross-compatible
            JavaScript, I'd highly recommend Peter-Paul Koch's site:

            now a JScript *shell* that runs in page context or on its own.
            <br />

            <br />
            It's not as easy as learning to use lisp by eval'ing buffers in
            Emacs but it's close :-)
