<div class="document">
<p>After too long, I've finally got my new blog up.  It's still not
finished, but it's a start, and I can finally start posting again.</p>
<p>I had to change servers, and in the process <a class="reference" href="http://www.myelin.co.nz/wcswiki/w/PythonCommunityServerSetupHowto">PyCS</a> got rather broken;
everytime there was a write it segfaulted.  These days I don't really
know what to do with myself when I encounter a segfault.  Anyway,
though it looks like <a class="reference" href="http://www.myelin.co.nz/post/2004/12/15/#200412151">PyCS will be able to use PostgreSQL</a> soon, I'm
afraid it's too late for me.</p>
<p>So it goes.  And, of course, every red blooded web programmer has to
make their own blogging software.  I should not deny these primitive
desires that lie in my heart.  I must go where so many have gone
before...</p>
<p>Along the way I made an atom exporter for <a class="reference" href="http://svn.colorstudy.com/home/ianb/pyds_to_atom.py">PyDS</a> and <a class="reference" href="http://svn.colorstudy.com/home/ianb/pycs_to_atom.py">PyCS</a> -- the
articles are exported from PyDS, and the comments from PyCS.  I
haven't got comments working, so I haven't imported them to the site;
I'll fix that soon.  I just needed to get something up.</p>
<p>The underlying software is <a class="reference" href="http://wiki.webwareforpython.org/thiswiki.html">this wiki</a>, tweaked.  I'm not sure if a
wiki and a blog really fit together, but we'll see.  Maybe before too
long I hope to be able to finish all the features that I've started,
then package the whole thing up, using it as an experiment in how well
I can package a Python web application.  But that will wait.</p>
<p>Ah, to post again!  (Now I wait, will this post really appear?)</p>
