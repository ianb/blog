                Python. (Peter Lount seems to have a bunch of apropos articles
                there, but no syndication feed...?)

                Anyway, I haven't read through them all, but this made me think:
            </p>
            <blockquote>
                Validations, all forms of them, are really a form of &quot;meta
                data&quot; about the program. &quot;Meta data&quot; are program
                statements (using a special syntax or using the general purpose
                language syntax) about the program itself. As Smalltalk has
                demonstrated the most powerful and general method of having meta
                data in a language is to have that meta data written in the
                general purpose syntax of the language itself. In this way meta
                data programming is the same as regular programming and many
                more programmers will be able to access this powerful dynamic
                capability. In Smalltalk style languages the &quot;meta
                data&quot; are first class objects. The impact of this is that
                much of the added meta data functionality can be written in the
                language itself and added as a group of &quot;classes&quot; (or
                objects) otherwise known as a Framework.

                >. These are simple, work right now, and really don't look bad
                at all:
            </p>
            <pre class="literal-block">
&#64;require(int, int)

            <p>
                It's rather simplistic, but the nice part is that it's easily
                implemented and easily <em>reimplemented</em>. If it was to
                become Part Of Python (i.e., included in the standard library,
                <em>not</em> in the syntax) then no doubt there's be a lot of
                debate and work on it, with respect to interfaces, sequences,
                adapters, etc., as well as extensibility.
            </p>
            <p>
                We also want inspectable metadata as well, not just imperative
                validation at runtime.
                <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">require</span></tt> can be
                modified to set known attributes on the function (e.g.,
                <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">__argspec__</span></tt
                >), or maybe something more sophisticated. Things like
                auto-completion would still have to load modules (and execute
                those decorators) to infer types and signatures, but I think
                that's okay. We should just get rid of modules that can't be
                safely loaded, they are a pain in the butt for everyone
                (including their authors); much better that than static typing!

                Even better, you could start with a stdlib module before you
                went to the builtin. I've always cringed at the thought of a
                &quot;decorators&quot; module as some have proposed (which seems
                to me about as meaningful as a module called
                &quot;functions&quot; or &quot;objects&quot;). But a module to
                collect type-checking techniques would be ideal. You could then
                provide the same tools for earlier versions of Python
                (pre-decorators, pre-unified-types, etc.). Various names present
                themselves. Perhaps it should be a submodule of pychecker?
                &gt;:)

                    Maybe the decorators could be part of the module that
                    implemented interfaces, since we sure should get interfaces
                    into the standard library before we start thinking about
                    type declarations anyway.

                    Using decorators for type signatures for callable arguments
                    has an important benefit: because of the extra typing
                    involved, and being a separate line from the 'def' statement
                    line, the 'syntax' alone would suggest to Python 'newbies'
                    to only use them if really needed.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I like <em>everything</em> about optional argument type
                    signatures for callables, except the idea of reading the
                    code from Java programmers beginning to use Python. They
                    would use it on <em>every darn thing under the sun</em>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As a separate line, at least it is trivial to 're-factor'
                    the code to remove unnecessary type signatures: just delete
                    the line.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Kudos on using &quot;restructured text&quot; as the markup
                    mechanism! Great stuff!
