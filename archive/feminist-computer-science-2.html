            </p>
            <p>
                I think history offers an interesting parallel here. Feminists
                criticized historical texts as being dominated by white men
                (which they were). The retort was that, in fact, historical
                events had been dominated by white men, and historians should
                not be criticized for writing about the truth. (The parallel
                being my own argument that women aren't particularly
                discriminated against in computer science, but rather they are
                not particularly attracted or naturally inclined to the field.)
            </p>
            <p>Feminists responded to this in various ways:</p>
            <p>
                One particularly pernicious group then went and denied there was
                any such thing as &quot;truth&quot; (the poststructuralists).
                Those people were intellectual bullies and hypocrites. I hate
                them. I'm not talking about them.
            </p>
            <p>
                Another group tried to find the women that were left out of
                history, like Amelia Earhart or Cleopatra. Frankly, this was a
                rather pathetic attempt, because the old school historians were
                right, history had been dominated by white men.
            </p>
            <p>
                A third group of feminists actually did something great, when
                they realized that the Great Women of History weren't going to
                provide a real alternative to the Great Men of History. There
                have always <em>been</em> women, but the way we looked at
                history didn't include them -- history based on battles and
                monarchs and contemporary historical accounts. To really look at
                the history of women, you had to look at the history of the
                people, not the history of the leaders. This kind of feminist
                history actually can speak a great deal about men -- about all
                the men who were left out of history just like the women had
                been. It talks about <em>life</em> through the ages, instead of
                just events. This history doesn't just serve to highlight women
                in history, but provides a whole new kind of history, and I
                think has been very influential on the entire field, and in a
                very positive way.
            </p>
            <p>
                To bring this back to computer science, it may require the same
                kind of redefinition of the field, and a radical reconstruction
                of the field. In the same way, this wouldn't benefit
                <em>just</em> women, but it would open up computer science to a
                whole new segment of people, men included. This is nothing new,
                really -- this is the dream of Logo, or the Dynabook, or a
                number of ideas of subtlely popularizing programming. Certainly
                it's not an easy path, and we can't simply will it to happen.
                But the result might be a &quot;humanized&quot; computer
                science.
            </p>
            <p>
                One could argue that we're already moving in that direction, but
                not due to the idealists. But I'll leave that for yet another
                day.

            True, but this is a recent change, and there are still not as many
            women as men in that field.

            <br />

            <br />
            Like accounting has been "humanized"?
            <br />

            <br />
            The great driver for getting women into IT is the gradual
            redefinition of gender roles in society. Women are getting into
            "male" jobs such as construction, emergency services and the
            professions, while more men are getting into "female" jobs such as
            primary school teaching and nursing.
            <br />

            <br />
            It's just a matter of time and I see no need to either hurry it, or
            hold it back.

            <hr noshade />
            Again, I'm coming from a pretty much feminist position here:
            <br />

            <br />
            I agree with Alan on the societal bases of the gender "divide" in
            IT, but disagree that there's no need to work upon it. I've been on
            equity committees at companies, and there has really been a lack of
            understanding about the effects of workplace environment and
            corporate culture on those who aren't outgoing straight white males
            (these are South African companies).
            <br />

            <br />
            When I started programming and playing with computers, there were
            always girls my age playing too. The culture was accepting to
            anyone, generally. Now, as "mainstream" influences started to
            dominate the culture (only in the past five to seven years ago),
            I've found there's less acceptance of others w.r.t. gender,
            sexuality, and culture. And the (now-) women I knew went into other
            fields.
            <br />

            <br />
            Lately, though, I've noticed a reversal in that as society (although
            not normally company cultures) becomes more accepting of women in
            what society previously considered "male" pursuits, there're more
            women coming into the market. If they're lucky, they find places
            that don't automatically require them to prove themselves to a
            higher level just because they're female. I'm currently working at a
            company where this doesn't appear to be an issue (although, we're
            still all white in the tech department).
            <br />

            <br />
            At a previous company, it really just took one incredibly skilled
            woman programmer to show the men that they're really boys and that
            they have a lot to learn too, and we had a lot less of a problem
            finding other women to join our staff, and the culture changed quite
            considerably.
            <br />

            <br />
            So, I don't think it's a matter of changing the subject to attract
            women. Rather, we should work to change the environment/culture and
            acceptability of the field so that those who are already attracted
            to the field are able to maintain and grow that attraction. And
            this'll happen anyway, but it's in our own interests to help it
            along as we're able to as members of the communities and corporate
            cultures.

            Neil: In the environments I've been in I really haven't seen
            discrimination, and I don't believe it's because I've been blind to
            any discrimination. That said, it is possible (indeed, probable)
            that the environments I've experienced are not entirely
            representative. <i>But</i>, while I've seen women-friendly
            environments (evidenced at least by the number of women), I haven't
            seen that lead to many women in programming positions in particular,
            or IT to a lesser degree. And in the open source community -- where
            I think there is very little discrimination (because, after all, no
            one even needs to know you are female), I also see very few women.
            <br />

            <br />
            One could redefine discrimination to include ways of interacting
            which may intimidate women... but I think that's expanding the
            definition of discrimination too far.

            Hey Ian,
            <br />

            <br />
            I think you may be surprised by the Open Source community. One of
            the leaders on the gender session at Africa Source, Fernanda Weiden,
            explained to us exactly how it felt joining certain communities on
            freenode, for example, and how being female affected the way people
            interacted with her, and so forth. That's something that guys don't
            have to deal with, and as such is a form of discrimination (which,
            ultimately is just behaving differently based on a characteristic).
            <br />

            <br />
            Or, as you mention, it's not so much intentional discrimination as
            an intimidating environment. The off-topic gender-based jokes on one
            LUG have led to a number of women leaving the group, for example.
            These weren't necessarily IT professionals, but they were interested
            enough to have Linux installed at home and to join a user group;
            exactly the people we need to keep advancing through the ranks.
            Hopefully they found homes elsewhere.
            <br />

            <br />
            (I guess that's what I meant about the culture becoming more
            "mainstream". The tech and Open Source communities I've been a part
            of were a lot more accepting of, for example, gay or transgendered
            members, than the mainstream then. But that gap is closing as tech
            and Open Source become more mainstream. Or I've just been unlucky in
            my choices of communities.)
            <br />

            <br />
            Back on work: one study that the other session leader related found
            that women tend not to over-inflate their ability, while men tend to
            do so by about 25% (IIRC). This leads to less self-advertising and
            thus less promotions and opportunities in the work-place.
            <br />

            <br />
            I suppose I just question the need to simplify or change the subject
            matter. I don't believe that there's anything inherently masculine
            about it, it's currently equally available, and there's only a
            little that one can focus on female issues that aren't just
            generally useful. I think the gender divide boils down to social
            acceptance, community, role models, and work environment, all
            working towards self-acceptance. Work on those, and we'll speed up
            the inevitable change.
            <br />

            <br />
            Perhaps humanisation should be focussed on the workplace/community -
            a sensitivity for the way that women tend to behave differently from
            men. Understanding that women might be a little less likely to brag,
            for example, would be useful for decision makers to decide on job
            applicants, promotions, and other opportunities. Understanding that
            confrontational styles would probably not be very effective with
            women too - although I think that's just a generally good idea.
            Understanding that inviting "The Boys" to the pub every Friday
            afternoon is just creating the impression of a "popular" sub-group
            unless other activities are found to bring in those who feel left
            out.
            <br />

            <br />
            But, as I said, I come from a pretty feminist position, so we may
            just be talking past each other on the basic causes.

            <br />
            Accessibility doesn't necessarily mean simplification, though it
            does mean change. Sometimes that change can be shallow, breaking
            down a perceived (but not actually present) barrier. Or it can be a
            radical redefinition. Even how you make that categorization is
            probably subjective. But anyway, that's not really what we disagree
            on. Mostly, I think the gender differences are based on inherent
            structure in the subject matter itself, while you feel it's based on
            the social structure. I wouldn't say one is more feminist than the
            other -- though certainly they are different kinds of feminisms. Not
            all feminists come down on the nurture side of the nature vs.
            nurture debate. (Not all... but maybe most ;)

                    I know this thread closed, well, quite some time ago. I'm
                    writing a report on gender bias in the computer industry,
                    and was wondering if anybody could answer a question for me.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As a female pursuing a career in computer science, would you
                    say the mainstream acceptance of the Internet and Personal
                    Computers has helped or hurt your pursuit?
                </p>
                <p>
                    My thought is that the white male computer culture has
                    gradually been entering society. That is, geeks, nerds,
                    gamers, whatever, are slowly being accepted into society.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This is a problem though, shouldn't it be the other way
                    around? Shouldn't the computer society's culture accept
                    EVERYONE, rather than impose its standards on the rest of
                    society?
                </p>
                <p>
                    Hope I explained that well, and don't worry about delay, the
                    paper's due tomorrow :D Just curious now.
