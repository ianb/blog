                I passed by some new-contruction luxury houses in my area. They
                had 4 bedrooms and 3-1/2 bathrooms.
            </p>
            <p>
                We saw a new contruction condo with two bedrooms, and two full
                bathrooms. One of the bathrooms had his and her sinks. It wasn't
                a big condo.
            </p>
            <p>
                What is wrong with people that they can't share bathrooms? Are
                we trying to maintain the highest per capita toilet rate? I
                can't find any numbers on the net, except that

                I have some friends who recently had a baby and bought a house.
                We went to see it, and they seemed almost apologetic about the
                house and its state. But it was <em>far</em> nicer than any
                house I grew up in (and I certainly never felt deprived). I
                think they hang out with the wrong people; it's easy for your
                expectations to increase in accordance with your peer group. I
                actually find I have to check myself often, I find myself
                drifting away from my frugal upbringing if I don't pay
                attention, surrounded by so many people intent on wasting their
                money on stupid little things.

                There's those that say our standard of living has been
                declining, but I don't really see it. Or rather, the quality of
                living is lowered because people are making stupid choices, not
                because the choices available to them are worse than before.
                (Except maybe for health care, where we have a shitty overpriced
                system that is only becoming more shitty and overpriced with
                time.) And if

                    You really are talented so, please don't get caught up in
                    never ending cynicism that just may not be true.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I read the link on 'economic collapse around the corner',
                    and truly, if you are taking this guys views to be even
                    somewhat objective with regard to the global economy then
                    you need to think twice.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I am an expat. living and working in Germany (one bathroom,
                    two flush options to save water), and I have a pretty good
                    sense of the world outside the US. That said, I also believe
                    that the US is still the best place on earth for real
                    _personal_ economic opportunity.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I know you are going to say what about Europe, what about
                    Asia, what about the debt, and what about the trade and
                    current account deficit..
                </p>
                <p>
                    Well, even though you will find this hard to believe,
                    especially if you are used to thinking that everything in
                    the US is crap and the grass is green on the other side, but
                    the first two have far more corruption, positions of favor,
                    and analysis paralysis then even the US. Not to mention a
                    complete lack of personal economic opportunity, you wouldn't
                    even believe it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The debt and the current account deficit is economics at
                    work. There is an ecomomic correction happening in the US.
                    It started back in the 80's, and one of my best economics
                    professors actually taught us about it back in the early
                    90's. His hypothesis basically was that the dollar was
                    overpriced then, as it is now, and would be weakened by
                    increases in the debt and trade deficits vs. the GDP. All
                    these things are still happening now. The impact of which
                    would be dampened by increasing the US's position as a
                    better investment for stronger currency investors and
                    eventually lead to a situation where the economy both
                    intact, more inline with reality, and a better value for new
                    opportunity.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As we are still in the middle of this correction no one
                    knows for sure where we are heading, but just maybe it is
                    not the hard landing that some are talking about..

                        I'm not sure we'll head for economic collapse. How would
                        I know? I do see real irrationality in the economy, and
                        problems in things <em>I</em> see as fundamental -- like
                        the fact we, as a nation, have turned to a service
                        economy. We spend all our times doing things for each
                        other, rather than making things. That sucks (but heck,
                        maybe a declining dollar will help change that).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        But, economy aside, I see a situation where economic
                        wealth (which is plentiful, recession or not) is not
                        providing much happiness, security, or freedom. Instead
                        of using wealth to put away some money for a rainy day,
                        people are spending furiously to match any gains they
                        see. Instead of using wealth to increase their
                        happiness, they are squandering it on stupid material
                        goods, like overbuilt houses and overbuilt vehicles.
                        Putting aside any moral consideration about the world
                        and limited resources, these things simply are
                        <em>effective</em> at making people happy. And instead
                        of using wealth to follow dreams, by squandering their
                        wealth people are cornering themselves, creating a
                        lifestyle that cannot withstand any transition. It's
                        concerning, and it's bad for everyone; not just the
                        individuals, but the families and communities and the
                        entire world. Hell, economic collapse might just be
                        better for everyone in the long term. Well, probably
                        not...

                        So you have been to Europe and have worked there. I also
                        have been to Europe and for you to say that Europeans do
                        not have a fairly high standard of living really is not
                        truthful. Also It depends where you live in Europe, In a
                        big expensive city or a smaller, less expensive town.
                        The average European worker receives over 50 days off a
                        year (Monday through Friday) which is over 10 weeks. The
                        average European receives free education and also free
                        Healthcare. The average European receives Sick Day when
                        they are ill. The average European works 38 hours a
                        week. Europeans receive complete Workers Injury
                        Compensation, Unemployment benefits, retraining, help
                        with Daycare, Many countries also help families obtain
                        flats and houses. In fact many European countries such
                        as Spain has Home Ownership over 80 percent of the
                        Population. The working population between the ages of
                        18 to 65 is around 64 percent, The U.S. is around 62 so
                        all this misinformation really is crap. My family is a
                        small busines owner and she is paying $1020.00 per month
                        for healthcare coverage with a $3600.00 deductable. That
                        does not cover dental work so if she wanted to have the
                        medical coverage they have in Germany it would cost her
                        probably $20,000 per year. What about going to college?
                        I have already been to college and have Graduated 10
                        years ago but would like to train for something else
                        because Our America Wages are so high. I'm looking into
                        Sonography but the college wants $30,000 for a 16 month
                        course. maybe the Government would pick some of the bill
                        up through grants but most of it they will not. How does
                        this help me? My Friend in Germany spends around $30
                        dollars a month on electricity for a 1000 square foot
                        flat in Essen. The total land tax, street cleaning,
                        heating, electricity and basic upkeep on the building is
                        around $1000.00 per year. Her Phone service is about
                        $30.00 per month. Her car Insurance for a new toyota
                        corolla is $500.00 per year. Germany's Income taxes are
                        between 15 to 42 percent depending on Income. For 4
                        liter of milk the price is around $2.30. The Price in
                        Florida would be over $3.00. Pineapples $2.00 Florida
                        $4.00 Monthly Florida Electricity bill: $100.00 Yearly
                        Florida Car Insurance: $1200.00 Phone Bill: $50.00
                        monthly basic service. Land Tax on typical house:
                        $1500.00 Water: 600.00 per year Garbage: 400.00 per year
                        House Insurance: $2000.00 What the Hell are you saying
                        about how good we have It? Bullshit! You can fool some
                        of the people some of the time but not everyone all of
                        the time. The U.S. has the most expensive Healthcare,
                        University costs and Insurance costs in the world. We
                        have a huge housing bubble, with prices far outstripping
                        Income. We have a 700 billion plus current account
                        deficit and rising. We have a 600 billion dollar
                        government debt and rising. We have almost 3 million
                        people in prison and another 5 million on parole by far
                        the most in the world! In Holiday, Florida which is near
                        Tampa the typical house is around $180000 and rising,
                        these are very moderate houses nothing to brag about. In
                        Tampa It would be over $200,000. The typical Wage for
                        the area is around $25,000 with many people making
                        $15,000 to $20,000. So the price to earnings ratio is
                        between 8 to 10 times income. It should be between 2 and
                        3 so the house prices versus income is 3 times higher
                        then they should be or a $200,000 house should be
                        between $65,000 and $70,000. The new houses they are
                        building are crap, they build then with pressed wood and
                        cheap materials throughout, also the prices on them
                        would be higher, maybe $250,000 for a moderate home. I
                        see people with no Health Insurance, I see Homeless who
                        are working, I see people working two jobs so they can
                        pay their bills. I see people who do not take any
                        vacations because they must work to live. I see people
                        who would like to go to college but cannot afford it.
                        Europe is the world's largest manufacturing economy,
                        largest exporters, largest Investors, and the world's
                        biggest market. China and Europe are the two economic
                        powerhouses of the world. Europe has a current account
                        surplus, much less personal debt then Americans,
                        Government debt of 2.7 percent of GDP which is lower
                        then America's at a time they are spending huge amount
                        of money building eastern europe up to western
                        standards. They are nuclear armed so no-one in their
                        right mind would attack them! Anyway have a nice day!
