                <a class="reference" href="http://formencode.org">FormEncode</a
                >, which has languished for a while, is starting to really come
                together. Peter Hunt added an enhancement to
                <a
                    class="reference"
                    href="http://svn.colorstudy.com/trunk/Validator/validator/htmlfill.py"
                    >htmlfill</a
                >
                for
                <a class="reference" href="http://subway.python-hosting.com/"
                    >Subway</a
                >
                that allows you to define a validation schema directly in the
                form, like:
            </p>
            <pre class="literal-block">
&lt;input type=&quot;text&quot; name=&quot;username&quot; form:required=&quot;yes&quot;&gt;
&lt;input type=&quot;text&quot; name=&quot;email&quot; form:validator=&quot;email&quot;&gt;
</pre
            >
            <p>
                I still have to add something for automatic error insertion
                (right now you have to put in explicit
                <tt class="literal"
                    ><span class="pre">&lt;form:error</span>
                    <span class="pre">name=&quot;tag_name&quot;&gt;</span></tt
                >
                tags), but with the two of those together I think it will be
                very easy to casually define forms, and won't even require
                &quot;programming&quot;.
            </p>
            <p>
                What makes me particularly happy about this is that I don't feel
                like anything is being compromised. It's really easy to define
                the same schema outside the form:
            </p>
            <pre class="literal-block">
class MySchema(schema.Schema):
    username = validators.NotEmpty()
    email = validators.Email()
</pre
            >
            <p>
                I think there will be a very smooth curve from the simplest
                techniques to the most sophisticated -- you don't have to start
                learning Big New Ideas to use the system in a more sophisticated
                way, you just have to learn a series of Small New Ideas. And I
                don't see any ceiling -- this could be reasonably used on the
                most complex forms or the simplest ones, where the forms are
                determined either in a completely ad hoc way or entirely
                programmatically.
            </p>
            <p>
                I started playing around with the
                <a
                    class="reference"
                    href="http://svn.colorstudy.com/trunk/Validator/validator/htmlform.py"
                    >glue</a
                >
                that pulls the form handling together; I think I'll have to
                really use it some to get a better feel for it. But I'm feeling
                close to a real FormEncode release, and one that is useable, not
                just for early adopters.

                    I like the way this uses the form to include some basic
                    validation. To me, it seems like the best approach. I agree
                    with your comments in an earlier post where you discussed
                    using completely programmatically generated forms vs styling
                    your own forms.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I used a similar approach as Formencode when collecting
                    values under Mason, using a HTML token parser to parse the
                    form and put errors in (as htmlfill does) that I
                    <a
                        class="reference"
                        href="http://www.groovie.org/archives/2004/11/a_mason_compone.html"

                </p>
                <p>
                    Now that I've switched to
                    <a class="reference" href="http://www.myghty.org/"
                        >myghty</a
                    >
                    though, I've been looking for the equivilant Python version,
                    Formencode with htmlfill and validators looks like it
                    handles it all. While you describe it as an &quot;early
                    adopter&quot; release, I'll give it a spin anyways. Any idea
                    how much the syntax would change before you get to a formal
                    release?

                I've been playing with htmlfill and the validators for a few
                hours, already noticed what I think is a bug. htmlfill has no
                handler to deal with input type='image'. After adding it to the
                block that skips 'button' and those types, it works fine again.

                    I really like how htmlfill works. I think it can function as
                    neat templating system too! If we just learn it about new
                    types of widgets, so it can fill them... Maybe using some
                    kind of schema:
                </p>
                <pre class="literal-block">
class TableWidget:
    class_ = 'grid' #maybe htmlfill can use css class to find element in the page?
    rows = RepeatWidget()
    paging = PagingWidget()
</pre
                >
                <p>
                    IMHO even most fancy designed website can be split into
                    standard widgets... Well, maybe I want it to be so :))

                    <p>
                        I'm actually very reluctant to add something like this
                        -- that's the kind of complexity that
                        <tt class="literal"
                            ><span class="pre">htmlfill</span></tt
                        >
                        is specifically meant to avoid, because I've gone down
                        that path before and it didn't work well. But the form
                        building you are thinking of could be implemented
                        separately -- this is some of what
                        <tt class="literal"
                            ><span class="pre">formgen</span></tt
                        >
                        is meant to provide. You can't quite do this now, but
                        something like this should be possible at some point:
                    </p>
                    <pre class="literal-block">
from formgen import *
class CCField(FormTableLayout):
    layout = [['cc_name'],
              ['cc_number', 'cc_type', 'cc_expiration', '=MM/YY']]
        # That last item is a literal instruction
    cc_name = Text(size=40)
    cc_number = Text(size=16)
    cc_type = Select(selections=['Visa', 'Mastercard', 'AmEx'])
    cc_expiration = Text(size=5)
</pre
                    >
                    <p>
                        And then that would be a reusable &quot;widget&quot;.
                        But it just gets rendered to HTML, and htmlfill fills it
                        in -- nothing more. Another subclass of
                        <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">Layout</span></tt>
                        might even work with a template, but create the
                        <tt class="literal"
                            ><span class="pre">&lt;input...&gt;</span></tt
                        >
                        tags and whatnot.
