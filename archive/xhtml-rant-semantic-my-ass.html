                People like to pretend HTML is semantic markup. (Semantic? No
                such thing exist. But I'll leave that inflamatory statement for
                another day).
            </p>
            <p>
                Case in point:
                <tt class="docutils literal"
                    ><span class="pre">&lt;em&gt;</span></tt
                >
                vs.
                <tt class="docutils literal"
                    ><span class="pre">&lt;i&gt;</span></tt
                >, and
                <tt class="docutils literal"
                    ><span class="pre">&lt;strong&gt;</span></tt
                >
                vs.
                <tt class="docutils literal"
                    ><span class="pre">&lt;b&gt;</span></tt
                >. People who believe in semantic markup think
                <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">em</span></tt>
                and
                <tt class="docutils literal"
                    ><span class="pre">strong</span></tt
                >
                are better, because they are &quot;semantic&quot; (are my scare
                quotes semantic?). But to me they are the exact opposite of
                semantic. What is &quot;emphasis&quot; supposed to mean? How is
                it different than &quot;strong&quot;? Beats me.
            </p>
            <p>
                Semantic markup is supposed to be <em>meaningful</em> markup.
                The reality of web pages is that they are a visual, published
                medium. People think about these mediums visually, not in terms
                of a taxonomy of expression. When I want italics, I want
                italics. There's no underlying desire. I don't want
                &quot;emphasis&quot;. I can reflect, and decide that I was
                intending to express emphasis, but that desire is retroactively
                determined, it is not my true desire at the moment when I was in
                the midst of composition. My true desire at that time
                <strong>really was</strong> &quot;I want this text to be slanty
                with little curls&quot;.
            </p>
            <p>
                This reminds me of (or maybe it's inspired by) a book I've been
                reading (slowly, for years),
                <a
                    class="reference"
                    href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0316180661/qid=1071267972//ref=sr_8_xs_ap_i0_xgl14/002-1820643-6823220?v=glance&amp;s=books&amp;n=507846"
                    >Consciousness Explained</a
                >. One of its core ideas is that consciousness is what we tell
                ourselves we were experiencing, it's not what actually goes on
                in our heads. What that <em>means</em> is another (long) topic,
                but functionally I assert that semantics are a conscious process
                on a level that is not otherwise required for composition. By
                requiring that kind of thought, we are weighing down the author
                whose effort should really be directed towards writing, not
                towards typography.

            Structural markup and semantic markup are separate things, IMHO.
            Structural markup means that you don't abuse tables and instead use
            divisions to organise a page (as an example). Semantic markup means
            you use accurate element types to describe your data. They are
            similar concepts, but not identical.
            <br />

            <br />
            "Case in point:" the I element type vs the EM element type. One
            means emphasis and the other means italics. It's arguable that the I
            element type should not have remained in HTML, but the argument for
            keeping it there was that there is a strong case for where italics
            is a convention that should not be broken; for example names of
            different species in biology texts.
            <br />

            <br />
            If I wanted to index a website for search purposes, then ranking the
            keywords within EM elements higher than normal text would be
            sensible. The same is not necessarily true of I elements. There are
            a number of search engines that behave differently based upon
            whether they encounter I or EM. I consider this to be a feature
            rather than a bug - after all, I means a completely different thing
            to EM. The only reason they are confused by authors is because the
            presentation in common browsers is the same.
            <br />

            <br />
            The difference between STRONG and EM is a matter of degree - there
            have been arguments that STRONG is redundant and that it should be
            replaced with nested EM elements. EM == emphasis. STRONG == strong
            emphasis.
            <br />

            I don't. You'll have to prove that assertion rather than simply say
            it and hope people believe you. If anything, I experience what I
            write aurally rather than visually - I'm sure I'm not the only
            person who writes with a tone of voice in mind rather than how it
            will look on the page.

            I think when I said "People think about these mediums visually" I
            was saying it the wrong way. People think of these in terms of
            example, and symmetrically with reading. I know what things are
            appropriate as italics because of an intuition I've developed with
            reading. Ditto punctuation and smiley faces. I don't
            <i>understand</i> the rules behind these. I could understand them, I
            could probably make something up if you asked, but I don't write
            based on rational rules. I think this is generally true of writers.
            I might even venture a guess that people who aren't comfortable
            writing often don't have that intuition, and attempting to simulate
            intuition with rules is difficult and distracting.
            <br />

            <br />
            My intuition says slanty-letters. If I read HTML source all the
            time, I might develop an intuition that mapped well to the
            <tt>em</tt> tag. Admittedly I don't see <tt>i</tt> either, but at
            least the mnemonic is better. And ReST is better yet, because I
            <i>do</i> read *italic* stuff often. (But is that italic or bold? It
            can be both, really)
            <br />

            <br />
            I also hate instant messangers that put in smiley faces. They are
            horrible. The smiley has become a valid (and very important) form of
            punctuation. Punctuation should have symmetry. I should see it on my
            keyboard, see it when I'm typing it, read it when it's sent to me.
            But then I seriously doubt anyone here would actually support the
            graphical smiley faces, so this is an empty rant ;)

            A curiosity :)
            <br />

            <br />
            When we shifted our project to using reST, I extended it in some
            ways, like being able to use triple-stars to emphasize + strong
            content. Because --- people thinking visually --- would need to do
            that some times.
            <br />

            <br />
            For some reason, much later, I found myself reading the docutils
            list, where a reST advocate strongly emphasized that this made no
            sense. "**" was "strong emphasis", so what (structurally,
            semantically, ?) sense did "strong emphasis" + "emphasis" make? And
            he was right: it doesn't really make any sense ... except it was
            definitely necessary.
            <br />

            <br />
            (And, um, I'd have to confess that the idea of generating smileys
            always seemed cool until the unbalanced paren problem became
            obviouis. Me, I can't stand the look of smileys in proportional
            fonts ;-)

            Are these debates just backwash from the introduction of HTML as a
            rough-and-ready, who-cares-about-strict-semantics markup language,
            and the subsequent stumbling attempts to separate structure and
            presentation with XHTML and CSS?
            <br />

            <br />
            To me, even though I've never used a screen reader, knowing they
            exist and that it's important as a web designer to acknowledge their
            existence has been crucial in recognising, for example, the
            difference between EM and I. The question "What is 'emphasis'
            supposed to mean?" seems odd in this light. It means emphasis ;-) I
            is just an overhang from HTML's mix of presentation and structure.
            The visual, printed convention for, say, book titles, is italics.
            But you wouldn't normally want such a title *emphasised* if the text
            was spoken aloud. (Theoretically, in this case you should extend
            XHTML with a BOOK element, or use a CLASS on a SPAN and apply the
            italics with CSS. I usually stick with I for
            backwards-compatibility.)
            <br />

            <br />
            Some words you want to emphasise. Visually, that usually translates
            as italics; aurally, it means intonation and volume. The web *is*
            primarily a visual medium, at the moment. But it seems wilfully
            ignorant to disregard the efforts to separate structure and
            presentation over the last 6 years or so.
            <br />

            <br />
            In terms of writing web content, as both a writer and web designer
            I've got used to writing with markup, and it's always my sub-vocal
            expressions that guide the markup I use.

            Gyrus: if you provide a semantic markup language, they won't come.
            People won't just spontaneously write properly-categorized semantic
            markup because in theory are are useful distinctions to be made.
            <br />

            <br />
            Though I suppose, given a semantic document source you could map it
            more accurately to HTML that made the distinction between
            <tt>i</tt> and <tt>em</tt>. Though I somehow doubt that this will be
            common enough to make i/em distinctions valuable for a screen
            reader. It's not that people who don't distinguish are insensitive
            to the blind -- writing relies on empathy, and there's simply a
            disconnect there.

            Mike,
            <br />

            <br />
            You miss my point. I was talking about writing, not reading. Of
            *course* bold and italics emphasise things when you are reading
            something in a visual medium. That the whole point of them.
            <br />

            <br />
            Ian seemed to be saying that when he writes something, his
            motivation for putting something in italics is that he wants it in
            italics, not to emphasise something. That's something the Robot
            Wisdom guy keeps saying, and it's not something I agree with.
            <br />

            <br />
            As I said before, I have a tone of voice in mind when I write - that
            doesn't mean that when I use EM elements my primary consideration is
            how the page will sound when read aloud.

            It occurs to me that when Ian says "The reality of web pages is that
            they are a visual, published medium." he is mostly (95+%) correct,
            and that the source of the division between semantic HTML and
            "classic" HTML hinges on this well-established precedent -- the
            majority of web pages are indeed designed for visual consumption.
            The "semantic" web, in W3C terms, refers to documents whose markup
            expresses meaning rather than presentation. Unfortunately, web-based
            browsers center around visual presentation, as does the primary
            XML-based markup language for web documents, XHTML.
            <br />

            <br />
            The key fact to consider is that 95+% of all web browsing is done
            using an agent that doesn't interpret meaning as such. Mozilla has
            the ability to apply separate presentation instructions (CSS files)
            to bare XML documents, but does any other user agent have this
            ability? Not that I am aware, or at least not completely (feel free
            to edumacate me... ;).
            <br />

            <br />
            I agree that XHTML is fundamentally broken in its current
            incarnation. The W3C would like us to believe that XHTML is
            semantic, an assertion with which I do not agree. I feel that XHTML
            is, still, a presentation language and I can prove it by pointing
            any standard browser at an XHTML document that does not contain any
            style information at all and still get typographic differentiation
            of portions of the text based on the XHTML-valid tag structure of
            the document.
            <br />

            <br />
            The unsolved problem, however, is the remaining 5-% of agents out
            there, screen readers et al., that do indeed interpret (X)HTML
            documents in ways that do not coincide with the visual presentation
            afforded by XHTML. To accommodate them, I write my HTML keeping in
            mind the W3C-intended differences between EM and I, and similar. I
            suspect I find it as natural as any other type of writing (coding),
            because I do write with a tone of voice in mind, as per Jim, rather
            than considering the visual presentation. Also, I have pretty
            thoroughly internalized the difference between EM and I, and similar
            cohorts, so that I actually *think* in terms of emphasis rather than
            italics. But then, I'm a very non-visual thinker in many ways. I
            think also that I got into the habit a long time ago of creating
            content first, without any consideration for presentation, and only
            after I'm finished with the content do I worry about how it looks. I
            know for a fact that most people don't write this way, but it was
            trained into me when I was working telephone support for MS Word.
            The more advanced features of Word (master documents, in particular)
            cannot be used effectively while writing. They can only be
            implemented properly by applying them after finishing content
            creation.
            <br />

            <br />
            Ian later says "if you provide a semantic markup language, they
            won't come. People won't just spontaneously write
            properly-categorized semantic markup...", with which I also agree.
            For the most part, people don't do something that provides no real
            payoff. But I think the payoff is pretty much right around the
            corner. Mozilla already supports styled XML. The other marginal
            browsers (sorry, I use a marginal browser myself -- Safari), if they
            don't support styled arbitrary (though valid) XML now, will do so
            shortly. I can't begin to guess when or if IE will support styled
            XML. Kimbro Staken's Syncato weblog software shows us how much added
            value XML brings to the table. Gentoo uses XML for its
            documentation, then transforms it to produce the web version. Once
            people start being able to use a single source document for both the
            content and the presentation, without mixing the presentation with
            the content and without making the presentation technology hard to
            use, semantic documents will come. Look at it this way: wouldn't it
            be easier to write content just once in an XML vocabulary that is
            well-suited to express the semantics of the content? Use an easy
            schema language (e.g. Relax NG) to describe the semantics, then just
            post the document wherever you want, and allow the user agent to do
            their job of presenting it to the user. Since the XML has semantic
            and structural meaning, processing tools can be quickly created to
            extract information and reuse it elsewhere, thus ennabling the law
            of unintended consequences.
            <br />

            <br />
            I feel that this is a compelling vision. I'd love to live in this
            future. I want it now. Bueller? Bueller? Bueller? :)

            A few further comments:
            <br />

            <br />
            - I think when XHTML is pushed as "semantic", the term's used in a
            relative sense. That is, well-formed, properly structured XHTML is
            more semantically useful than HTML 3.2 tag soup cluttered with
            spacer GIFs, table layouts, etc. I don't think anyone ever claimed
            that it was as semantically rich as, say, MathML. It's a
            general-purpose document markup language that encourages separation
            of presentation from structure. Full XML support in major browsers
            will widen our options, I guess.
            <br />
            - To be fair, even HTML 3.2 can be "properly structured" in the
            sense used above - though the technology itself doesn't encourage
            it, as XHTML/CSS does.
            <br />
            - I'm not sure that browsers having built-in presentation defaults
            (paragraph spacing, heading sizes, etc.) implies that XHTML "centers
            around visual presentation". XHTML very generally describes
            hypertext documents. The same one can be read out, or rendered
            visually on radically different devices (presumably each with their
            own defaults). The document doesn't change, as, apart from rogue
            bits like the I and BR elements, the markup has little to do with
            presentation of any sort.

            <br />

            <br />
            Agreed, XHTML as semantic is a relative term. However, I disagree
            that XHTML encourages separation of presentation from structure. I
            will instead claim that the W3C is pushing that separation using
            XHTML (among various other technologies), and XHTML makes it
            possible. However, making something possible is *not* the same thing
            as encouraging it. Speaking of the technology alone, rather than the
            W3C's position papers, the technology does not really make it any
            easier to write semantic XHTML+CSS than to write tag soup. Pre-CSS
            HTML does not make it possible at all. XHTML+CSS does, at least,
            make it possible. Availability of browsers that do not have
            presentation defaults for XHTML tags, but instead rely on CSS for
            *all* presentation, now THAT is encouragement. ;) Imagine a web
            browser that accepts XHTML, and effectively strips out all tags
            before presentation -- you are left with, visually, a plain text
            document. No presentation at all. If you attach a CSS stylesheet to
            the document, then and only then the browser presents it according
            to the CSS. At that point, you have XHTML markup that is structural.
            You have markup that provides semantic meaning, and nothing else.
            Now you are forced to examine the structure of the document, to see
            whether or not that structure is accurate and provides value. The
            presentation is a side issue -- how, given a particular class of
            user agent, shall I best present this document? is a question that
            is not relevant to the issue of how much value is imparted by a
            given type of markup. I believe that XHTML provides little added
            value as markup. Considered as an XML vocabulary, for purposes of
            structure, metadata and semantic meaning, XHTML provides little
            value. Hypertext links are useful. Meta tags are good, but other XML
            vocabularies better represent the same information. Likewise with
            the actual document structure -- I'd rather use a special-purpose
            XML vocabulary that better expresses the semantics of my individual
            document, if I'm going to the effort of adding semantic markup.
            Wouldn't you?
            <br />

            <br />
            On the other hand, considered as the predominantly available means
            of presenting documents on the web, XHTML rawks. It's widely
            available, it looks good, there isn't a steep learning curve, and
            tools are widespread. Note the use of the word "presenting".
            <br />

            <br />
            And that's my main point. XML either adds value to some degree, or
            it doesn't. If it adds value, I want to know in what context is that
            value added? In the case of XHTML, the context, 95+% of the time, is
            viewing the added presentation abilities, plus the value of working
            links. I don't get any value at all from the W3C's intent to saddle
            XHTML with some hand-waving semantic meaning. Alternative user
            agents do, and so I keep them in mind when I write HTML, and choose
            markup that works reasonably well for as many cases as I find
            reasonable for the personal effort.
            <br />

            <br />
            And, when I can reasonably assume that the intended audience for my
            web-available documents use browsers that support CSS-styled
            arbitrary XML, or don't care about the presentation value in the
            first place (spiders and such), I will very happily switch over to
            XML, and take part in the semantic web.
            <br />

            I don't think XHTML was ever intended to be an entirely semantic
            language. If there were no XHTML - just HTML and then XML - the
            transition to semantic mark-up would never occur. Developers would
            not chose to create XML documents because they would be excluding
            the large portion of their audience whose clients do not support
            XML.
            <br />
            XHTML bridges the gap between HTML and XML. It allows developers to
            produce documents that are as semantic and 'future proof' as
            possible without excluding their audience. When the time comes and
            most clients do support XML, the step up to XML will be less arduous
            than from HTML.

                    &quot;By requiring that kind of thought, we are weighing
                    down the author whose effort should really be directed
                    towards writing, not towards typography&quot;
                </p>
                <p>
                    Exactly. I once had a univesity prof who wrote his own
                    textbook. He was free to sprinkle italics and bold and
                    underlines wherever he pleased as he wrote. Unfortunately he
                    knew nothing of typography. The result was a text that was a
                    mess and near impossible to read.

                <p>
                    Now what if this professor made an effort to simply indicate
                    which words were titles and which phrases required emphasis,
                    etc. (&quot;semantic markup&quot;)? Enter one skilled
                    typographer to create a stylesheet prior to printing. The
                    result is a beautiful volume that conveys precisely what the
                    author intended, but free from his primitive, ad-hoc
                    typography.
