(disappointedly) that decorators in Python 2.4 will look like, I
guess:

</p><pre>class Whatever(object):<br />    @staticmethod<br />    def something(a, b, c): ...<br /></pre>

Blech.  @ is ugly and arbitrary and confusing.  And seemingly out of
the blue -- several much more reasonable alternatives were being
discussed, I thought.

<p>

He suggests another technique, that can be applied even to Python 2.2
and 2.3, and looks like:

</p><pre>class Whatever(object):<br />    __metaclass__ = DecoratableType<br />    decorator(staticmethod)<br />    def something(a, b, c): ...<br /></pre>

This looks okay to me (except the metaclass, but that's really an
implementation detail).  I'd rather it look like syntax, but I prefer
a real word to @.  Something I can pronounce, even if I'm only reading
silently to myself.

<p>

Notably, this reminds me very much of Zope interfaces and adapters,
which look something like:

</p><pre>class Whatever(object):<br />    implements(IWhatever)<br /></pre>

Or PyProtocols:

<pre>class Whatever(object):<br />    advise(provides=[IWhatever])<br /></pre>

All three are an extended kind of metaprogramming.  All three work
through nasty tricks, tricks that involve going into the calling
frames, applying temporary metaclasses, and other bad stuff.

<p>

But it seems to me that all these cases are asking for another kind of
meta-programming, something more compile-time, something a little less
intrusive and a little more cooperative than metaclasses.  While I
would very much like decorators, I'd much rather wait until after 2.4
for a solution that covers all these issues.  Especially since all of
these issues are proven needs, as exemplified by the hacks that are
already being put in place.

 I've added to comment to JP Calderone's post in defence of

@decorator.  I won't repeat it
<br />
all here, except for this plea:
<br />
please try @decorator for a few
<br />
days and see if it grows on you.

 Anthony checked in the @ syntax today. He said that Guido's description included the phrase "a syntax we all hate equally".
<br />

<br />
Ho hum.

 I think the key points are (1) the existing foo = decorator(foo) approach is the "backward compatible" answer - compatibility isn't the issue people make of it, (2) some people (notably the ObjC crowd) have a strong and specific need for something like this, and (3) the endless discussions have shown no sign of stopping, have never demonstrated a clear "preferred answer", and everyone is tired of them.
<br />

<br />
For better or worse, "we all hate equally" is the best around (short of sticking with foo = decorator(foo)).

Having said this, you could make the same comments about the "conditional operator" discussions. Maybe Guido should have done the same thing there :-)

 Well, Guido has always been clear on what decorator syntax he preferred.  And in the old days, we used to trust his intuition; if he didn't like something, it stayed out of the language.  That was, of course, what made Python so damn good.
<br />

<br />
I'm less impressed by the current design-by-arguing-until-nobody-cares-anymore approach.  I really hope we won't see too much of that in the future...

 @something is ugly and unpythonic imho. Don't know if anybody has mentioned it, but I'd go with the decorator-block syntax, easy to spot, easy to read, and saves lot of typing.
