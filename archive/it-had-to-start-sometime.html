            Unbelievable! And he even had the temerity to leave his email
            address. I'd be inclined to put his email address somewhere where
            the spammers will get ahold of it.

            Anyway, clearly the bar needs to be raised for submitting a package
            on PyPI. Perhaps there should be a requirement to upload a valid
            setup.py file as part of the submission

            Or maybe we could just allow people to upload "spam" and then have a
            volunteer to clean it out (conservatively). After all,
            <a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki" target="_blank">wiki</a> appears to
            work -- perhaps

            isn't so bad.

            The PyPI RSS feed also makes it really easy to keep track of added
            packages, so it's not too big a deal to handle the odd bit of spam.
