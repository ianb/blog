        <h1>Paste App Installation</h1>

        <div class="document">
            <p>
                I just made a first run at some tools in
                <a class="reference" href="http://pythonpaste.org/script"
                    >Paste Script</a
                >
                for installing web applications.
            </p>
            <p>
                The idea is a two-phase installation; first you install the
                package distribution and ask it to write out a sample
                configuration. Then you edit the configuration. Then you ask the
                application to set itself up (maybe setting up databases, making
                directories, etc).
            </p>
            <p>
                This is not unlike a fancier-seeming system where there's a web
                interface or GUI or whatnot; except all that interaction is
                encapsulated in editing a text configuration file. I think this
                is a good technique because (a) it much much easier to
                implement, (b) it is consistent with later maintenance, (c) it
                uses a powerful native UI that many people are comfortable with
                (the text editor), and (d) it requires very little work for an
                application to support.
            </p>
            <p>So, in the trunk you can do:</p>
            <pre class="literal-block">
$ paster prepare-app \
  -f http://pythonpaste.org/package_index.html \
  PasteHelloWorld helloworld.ini
$ edit helloworld.ini
$ paster setup-app helloworld.ini
</pre
            >
            <p>You can also combine this all into:</p>
            <pre class="literal-block">
$ paster prepare-app \
  --edit --setup \
  -f http://pythonpaste.org/package_index.html \
  PasteHelloWorld helloworld.ini
</pre
            >
            <p>
                Which will immediately open the configuration file in your
                editor, and when you are done editing it will set up the
                application. (And
                <tt class="docutils literal"
                    ><span class="pre">prepare-app</span></tt
                >
                also installs the application with easy_install, so it really
                can be just one step).
            </p>
            <p>
                This is a pretty early prototype, really, so I'm still very
                interested in feedback on even the most minor details. Like,
                what should these commands be called?
            </p>
            <p>
                Also, people lay out their systems differently. I have a vague
                concept of a &quot;system configuration&quot; which will
                determine some basics about what goes where. But it's very
                vague. Ideally I'm hoping that hosting companies could setup
                such a configuration so that everything Just Works for users,
                including system hooks to be run on installation and whatnot.
                Now that I think about it, that probably means entirely new
                system-specific command-line options as well.
            </p>
            <p>
                I've also written a simple class for setting up applications, so
                that you can add this to your application's
                <tt class="docutils literal"
                    ><span class="pre">setup.py</span></tt
                >:
            </p>
            <pre class="literal-block">
setup(...
    entry_points=&quot;&quot;&quot;
    [paste.app_install]
    main = paste.script.appinstall:Installer
    &quot;&quot;&quot;)
</pre
            >
            <p>
                This will look for a template configuration file in
                <tt class="docutils literal"
                    ><span class="pre"
                        >MyPackage.egg-info/paste_deploy_config.ini_tmpl</span
                    ></tt
                >
                (a Cheetah template, actually), and run
                <tt class="docutils literal"
                    ><span class="pre"
                        >mypackage.websetup.setup_config()</span
                    ></tt
                >
                on setup, and probably more things over time.
            </p>
            <p>
                At some point I also plan to add such a generic setup class to
                SQLObject, so that a SQLObject-using application will be able to
                automatically set up its database on installation, as well as
                upgrade its database later (these classes should be reentrant,
                so you can run
                <tt class="docutils literal"
                    ><span class="pre">paster</span>
                    <span class="pre">setup-app</span>
                    <span class="pre">config_file.ini</span></tt
                >
                at any time to confirm and apply any new things to be setup).
            </p>
