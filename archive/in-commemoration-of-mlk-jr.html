                In commemoration of Martin Luther King Jr., I offer three quotes
                (short excerpts) from his speach

            <blockquote>
                <p>
                    [...] They asked if our own nation wasn't using massive
                    doses of violence to solve its problems, to bring about the
                    changes it wanted. Their questions hit home, and I knew that
                    I could never again raise my voice against the violence of
                    the oppressed in the ghettos without having first spoken
                    clearly to the greatest purveyor of violence in the world
                    today: my own government. For the sake of those boys, for
                    the sake of this government, for the sake of the hundreds of
                    thousands trembling under our violence, I cannot be silent.

                    The war in Vietnam is but a symptom of a far deeper malady
                    within the American spirit, and if we ignore this sobering
                    reality, we will find ourselves organizing &quot;clergy and
                    laymen concerned&quot; committees for the next generation.
                    They will be concerned about Guatemala and Peru. They will
                    be concerned about Thailand and Cambodia. They will be
                    concerned about Mozambique and South Africa. We will be
                    marching for these and a dozen other names and attending
                    rallies without end unless there is a significant and
                    profound change in American life and policy. So such
                    thoughts take us beyond Vietnam, but not beyond our calling
                    as sons of the living God.

                    It is a sad fact that because of comfort, complacency, a
                    morbid fear of communism, and our proneness to adjust to
                    injustice, the Western nations that initiated so much of the
                    revolutionary spirit of the modern world have now become the
                    arch antirevolutionaries. This has driven many to feel that
                    only Marxism has a revolutionary spirit. Therefore,
                    communism is a judgment against our failure to make
                    democracy real and follow through on the revolutions that we
                    initiated. Our only hope today lies in our ability to
                    recapture the revolutionary spirit and go out into a
                    sometimes hostile world declaring eternal hostility to
                    poverty, racism, and militarism. With this powerful
                    commitment we shall boldly challenge the status quo and
                    unjust mores, and thereby speed the day when &quot;every
                    valley shall be exalted, and every mountain and hill shall
                    be made low; the crooked shall be made straight, and the
                    rough places plain.&quot;

                The rest of this speach also includes an interesting history of
                the Vietnamese conflict.
