        <div class="document">
            <p>
                <strong>Note:</strong> WSGIKit has been renamed to
                <em>Python Paste</em>
            </p>
            <p>
                I think there's some confusion about what WSGIKit is, and what I
                intend for it to provide:
            </p>
            <ul class="simple">
                <li>
                    WSGIKit isn't WSGI. &quot;WSGIKit&quot; is, rather, a poor
                    name for a project. It really needs a new name. Greg McClure
                    <a class="reference" href="wsgikit-tutorial.html#comments"
                        >suggested</a
                    >
                    Underware, which kind of amuses me, but probably is a bad
                    choice.
                </li>
                <li>
                    WSGIKit isn't a WSGI server. Still, it does include glue for
                    servers (just a couple now, but more in the future). It will
                    probably be distributed with some servers, just because
                    that's more expedient and gives people a better experience.
                </li>
                <li>
                    WSGIKit includes several pieces of middleware, like an error
                    catcher and a session manager.
                </li>
                <li>
                    WSGIKit includes a from-scratch reimplementation of the
                    <a class="reference" href="http://webwareforpython.org"
                        >Webware</a
                    >
                    API, but that API is completely separated in a subpackage
                    (<tt class="docutils literal"
                        ><span class="pre">wsgikit.webkit</span></tt
                    >) and while it has (so far) driven the specific features,
                    it isn't preferred in any way.
                </li>
                <li>
                    I use Zope Page Templates in the
                    <a
                        class="reference"
                        href="http://wsgikit.org/docs/TodoTutorial.html"
                        >tutorial</a
                    >, but that's even less connected, just some code to
                    integrate ZPT written for the old Webware, that also works
                    for WSGIKit Webware.
                </li>
                <li>
                    I've included a script (<tt class="docutils literal"
                        ><span class="pre">app-setup</span></tt
                    >) for setting up new application instances. This creates
                    files and directories, and can provide custom commands as
                    well. This uses &quot;application template&quot;, the first
                    of which (<tt class="docutils literal"
                        ><span class="pre">webkit_zpt</span></tt
                    >) is based on Webware,
                    <a
                        class="reference"
                        href="http://wiki.w4py.org/component.html"
                        >Component</a
                    >, and
                    <a
                        class="reference"
                        href="http://imagescape.com/software/ZPTKit/"
                        >ZPTKit</a
                    >.
                </li>
                <li>
                    It includes a script for starting up servers and the general
                    WSGIKit environment. This involves creating a stack of WSGI
                    middleware, some application loader, and loading the
                    appropriate configuration.
                </li>
                <li>
                    It includes configuration. Configuration currently is just
                    done with Python files. To a degree other formats could be
                    supported, though often that is more difficult in practice
                    than theory. This configuration is used by a variety of
                    middleware as well as the server. It is also used by
                    <tt class="docutils literal"
                        ><span class="pre">app-setup</span></tt
                    >
                    and possibly other components. I've already integrated
                    SQLObject (through
                    <tt class="docutils literal"
                        ><span class="pre">sqlobject-admin</span></tt
                    >) into this configuration.
                </li>
                <li>
                    It includes a single URL parser at this point, that matches
                    the general algorithm of Webware URL parsing. This is also,
                    essentially, the application builder -- it loads modules and
                    files, looks for appropriate objects in those modules, and
                    can do small amounts of conversion to get them in an
                    appropriate state. It doesn't strictly &quot;know&quot;
                    about Webware, but not-so-coincidentally it works with the
                    Webware model. I'd like to include other URL
                    parsers/application builders -- as few as possible, but as
                    many as necessary to support the full range of URL parsing
                    we see in the wild. The full range isn't actually that full
                    -- the current parser plus an object publisher or two
                    (configurable to provide backward-compatible parsing) should
                    do.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The basic architecture is similar -- I think -- to Java
                    servlet filters. Or CherryPy filters. Or other pipeline-like
                    systems. Still when possible code should be provided as
                    libraries instead of middleware (it's more predictable,
                    easier to use), but that's not always possible. By using
                    generic middleware -- especially as we add more
                    configuration to the middleware -- we can introduce global
                    and interesting functionality to an application or a set of
                    applications.
                </li>
                <li>
                    It includes a kind-of test framework, based on
                    <a
                        class="reference"
                        href="http://codespeak.net/py/current/doc/test.html"
                        >py.test</a
                    >. Kind of a framework, because it's not very complicated,
                    but I've found it quite convenient -- WSGI makes it easy to
                    test individual pieces in isolation, and to create fake
                    requests. So unit testing can occur reliably on a fairly
                    granular level. I've also been building a bit of a framework
                    for testing tutorials with doctest.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Hopefully soon it will provide a nice installation
                    experience, including a large download that includes all
                    sorts of optional pieces that might be useful or helpful.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                So... that's what WSGIKit is. I'd really like to support more
                frameworks, more servers, and bring more developers in. There's
                room! I'm willing to give commit access to anyone who's been
                around in the community, or really anyone who shows a little
                interest and competence (and of course plays well with others)
                -- the nice thing about version control is that nothing is
                permanent, so we might as well take advantage of that. I think
                WSGIKit has the potential to provide a compelling and simple
                installation and configuration experience for a whole variety of
                frameworks, removing the diversity that's not interesting but
                just annoying. At the same time it shouldn't infringe on any of
                the interesting diversity. It's also a good, testable, decoupled
                architecture to make a solid foundation.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Update</strong>: A couple people complained that I
                haven't actually said what WSGIKit <em>is</em>, maybe just where
                I think it should fit in. So...
            </p>
            <ul class="simple">
                <li>
                    WSGIKit uses
                    <a
                        class="reference"
                        href="http://www.python.org/peps/pep-0333.html"
                        >WSGI (PEP 333)</a
                    >
                    as its means of internal communication. In practice, this is
                    like a request and response object, in the form of the
                    environ dictionary (the request) and the return values and
                    callbacks (the response). The PEP explains WSGI well, so I
                    won't repeat the whole thing.
                </li>
                <li>
                    WSGIKit includes a &quot;server&quot; program, which starts
                    up a server (e.g., Twisted) and reads the configuration, and
                    sets up the stack of components and middleware. If you look
                    at the
                    <a
                        class="reference"
                        href="http://wsgikit.org/docs/TodoTutorial.html"
                        >tutorial</a
                    >, you'll see some of how that works (the tutorial doesn't
                    leave out any steps, except for the download-all-components
                    part, which I'm still working out). In many ways, I'm seeing
                    that this startup process is fairl central.
                </li>
                <li>
                    WSGIKit isn't a framework, but kind of a glue for
                    frameworks, and infrastructure to set up and deploy
                    projects. It's like a metaframework, but maybe that makes it
                    sound fancier than it actually is.
                </li>
                <li>
                    WSGIKit contains reusable components for use
                    <em>in</em> frameworks. It's like a library for frameworks,
                    and a library for some stuff that wasn't possible to
                    generalize across frameworks without WSGI. From this
                    perspective, it's only interesting to framework authors
                    (though web developers tend to drift into framework
                    development whether they want to or not, so it's not
                    entirely hidden).
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                So... what is WSGIKit? Maybe I'm a little confused now as well.
                I guess it's really about glue and reusable components to be
                provided to framework authors. Which puts it in a slightly funny
                place, because as glue it's actually front-facing to users in
                many ways. It's not an app server -- it can be run in a
                threaded, multiprocess, or CGI environment, embedded in Twisted,
                Apache, or another container. It's not a framework, those get
                built on top. It's not a template at all, nor any sort of model.
                It's just a lot of glue, I guess.

                    Bah! This does not explain what WSGIKit <em>is</em>. It

                        I think Mr. Sparks has it right here -- one rough
                        graphic with some boxes and arrows could probably
                        largely explain what you've clearly put a lot of time
                        into writing. Perhaps a couple possible setups with
                        well-known (in python webapp world at least) frameworks
                        and/or behind apache with the parts labeled would
                        probably explain it once and for all for the dim-witted
                        or short of attention of us out here.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        And if you happen to be on a Mac and/or have access to
                        OmniGraffle that app makes almost any diagram look all
                        fancy and special.

                        Also I keep sort of sensing the word 'substrate' as kind
                        of what/where wsgikit is - maybe 'webstrate'. Assuming I
                        kind of understand correctly...

                Framework glue, huh? Pehaps you could call it &quot;sticky&quot;
                or &quot;elmers&quot;, &quot;Pyste&quot; (python-paste or
                phonetically &quot;pissed&quot;). I'm envisioning frameworks as
                popsicle sticks or toothpicks and WSGIKit as the paste that
                holds it all together. Hmm... WSGIKit -&gt; stikwig, swiktig,
                wisk, gitwisk, wig skit! Hmm... running &quot;wsgi glue&quot;
                through an gives &quot;wiggles u&quot;. ;-) Hmm... What about
                &quot;Waypoint&quot;?

                    Just call it Chicago... as in &quot;all roads lead to

                    I'll add my voice to the general clamor of those who were
                    hoping for an actual answer to the title question. I'm
                    pretty sure now that it has more to do with web presentation
                    than it does with scientific computing... but I was hoping
                    to pin it down a bit more clearly. An example or two might
                    help: &quot;<em
                        >I would use WSGIKit when coding XXX because it provides
                        YYY.</em
