            Of course, nobody seems to be talking about Macromedia's
            <a href="http://www.macromedia.com/software/flex/">Flex</a> and the
            continuing application development capabilities within Flash itself.
            Hindered by stigma that Flash is evil and purely about animation
            amongst developers that should be buying into Flex, it's hard to see
            this combination taking off; however, as a dark horse, it's a hard
            one to ignore on sheer numbers alone. Ninety-odd percent of web
            users have Flash installed, and Flash renders consistently
            cross-platform. Remember what Joel reminds us though: it's all about
            developers.

        <p>
            There are some really cool Flash applications out there, and a lot
            of places where Flash is probably an excellent choice of platform.
            As long as you don't mind being a

            developers.

        <p>
            Macromedia's model is one where they have to make developers happy,
            because developers are the ones who give them money. In their
            formative years the browsers didn't work to make developers happy,
            they competed for users, knowing that developers would follow users
            (this, in a time when users had some choice).
        </p>

        <p>
            What makes developers happy? Or rather, the people who are always
            telling developers what to do? Control. "They" (the people who pay
            us developers) love to define what a user should and shouldn't be
            able to do. They have a general principle of denying everything that
            you don't explicitly allow. Who needs a back button? Who needs
            readable source? Why dissect the application into pieces (aka,
            pages)? An application might have structure in the IDE, but who
            cares about the deployed application. They wrote the application to
            render on one reader (Macromedia's) and they don't need nor care for
            any intermediate tools.
        </p>

        <p>
            The result? Flash applications look nice, but they aren't that fun
            to use outside of small doses. Maybe it's because Flash is stretched
            when you implement an application using it -- maybe Flex will be
            better -- but that won't change the basic economics, and who
            Macromedia answers to. Open source, open standards, and
            non-commercial infrastructure isn't just good for developers, it's
            good for users.
