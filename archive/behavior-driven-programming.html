            <p>
                In the podcast Python came up briefly, and a question about
                whether you could do the same thing in Python. From a quick
                look, I would say no -- it involves injecting methods into
                Object, which you cannot do in Python. I assume there are other
                aspects to the system, but I don't understand them all.
            </p>
            <p>Here's a basic example from the tutorial:</p>
            <pre class="literal-block">
rob = Robot.new

rob.should_not_be_nil
rob.should_be_kind_of Robot
rob.x_coordinate.should_equal 0
rob.y_coordinate.should_equal 0
rob.location.should_equal [0,0]

rob.move_north(1).should_equal [0, 1]
rob.move_south(5).should_equal [0, -4]
rob.move_east(10).should_equal [10, -4]
rob.move_west(5).should_equal [5, -4]
</pre
            >
            <p>
                While you can't implement
                <tt class="docutils literal"
                    ><span class="pre">.should_equal</span></tt
                >
                in Python, this is trivially translatable to

                this does -- at its simplest you can put that sample interaction
                into a text file, then run

            <p>
                I think doctest exemplifies this idea of &quot;behavior driven
                programming,&quot; though it's usually referred to as
                &quot;documentation driven programming&quot; here.
            </p>
            <p>
                RSpec also adds specifications, which are just groupings,
                xUnit-style TestCases. Nothing special there. I know how to
                write functions and factor code already, thank you.
            </p>
            <p>
                So, the advantages of RSpec over doctest? Please note them in
                the comments, I'm not really seeing anything. Doctest can be a
                nuisance sometimes because of an explicitness that can lead to
                fragility -- doctest pays attention to <em>everything</em> and
                it's not that hard to turn that off, whereas RSpec is more
                selective. But I don't know if that makes RSpec better.
            </p>
            <p>The advantages of doctest over RSpec?</p>
            <ul class="simple">
                <li>
                    Tests can be in independent files, RSpec style, or embedded
                    into source docstrings.
                </li>
                <li>Tests in docstrings incur no overhead.</li>
                <li>
                    Interstitial narratives are strongly encouraged in doctest
                    -- far moreso than just allowing comments.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Typically doctests are renderable as documentation. Not all
                    doctests are nice documentation, but many are.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Conversely, doctests are a good way to test documentation
                    (which was the original purpose).
                </li>
                <li>
                    It is very simple to start using it. If you don't write
                    tests currently, writing doctests is the best way to start.
                    If you like the interactive prompt and play with your
                    modules that way, then moving to doctest is practically
                    seemless.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Doctest is not without its flaws, though I would say most of
                those flaws are small usability aspects -- many of which were
                fixed in Python 2.4, but turned off by default. Doctest also
                gets used in inappropriate places sometimes, but I think that's
                mostly to avoid the needless complexity of
                <tt class="docutils literal"
                    ><span class="pre">unittest.TestCase</span></tt
                >. Using a
                <a
                    class="reference"
                    href="http://codespeak.net/py/current/doc/test.html"
                    >good test runner</a
                >
                I feel much less of a desire to use doctests unless I really am
                telling a story of some sort.
            </p>
            <p>
                I think doctest is a great example of what Python gets right and
                Smalltalk-style systems get wrong. Doctest is just a tool. It's
                not a framework. You don't subclass anything. In Smalltalk you
                have this nice GUI IDE that rewards subclassing, and conflates
                the class hierarchy with other kinds of organization, and
                punishes procedural programming when it takes the form of
                disassociated actions. In Smalltalk it seems like everything
                turns into a framework, whether you like it or not.
            </p>
            <p>
                Doctest of course implements classes for internal use. Classes
                are a good way to express lots of things. But they aren't a very
                good way to share. And so doctest doesn't encourage you to use
                any of those classes unless you are customizing the system in
                some way. <em>Customizing</em> the system and <em>using</em> the
                system are entirely separate (a notable difference from xUnit
                and RSpec). Doctest is just plain good design.
            </p>
            <p>
                And Behavior Driven Programming? Yep, that's a good idea, so a
                shout out to Tim Peters for contributing that to the Python
                community years ago.

                    Huh. &quot;Behavior Driven&quot;? Hey, I hear those Ruby
                    people are good at marketing, so maybe they needed a new
                    name for unittesting? Maybe that's not a bad thing. RSpec
                    seems like .. exactly .. py.test? I can't find the blog
                    article mentioned (A New Look at Test Driven Development),
                    but is there some aversion to &quot;assert&quot; in tests
                    that I'm not aware of? Doctest is even nicer, when that's
                    all you need, but other than the Ruby habit of using words
                    to mean builtin things (DSL, righto) x.should_equal 0 =&gt;
                    assert x == 0, right? I thought there must be something more
                    I was missing, but here's the full list of expectations that
                    I can find in the source doc on the RSpec site:
                </p>
                <pre class="literal-block">
should_raise -&gt; assert py.test.raises
should_not_raise -&gt; assert not py.test.raises
should_be_empty -&gt; assert len(x) == 0 # couple options here, depending on what this means
should_be_false -&gt; assert x is False
should_be_nil -&gt; assert x is None
should_be_same_as -&gt; assert x is y
should_be_true -&gt; assert x is True
should_equal -&gt; assert x == y
should_include -&gt; assert x in y
should_match -&gt; (not sure what this ruby means)

                <p>and _not_ versions of the same.</p>
                <p>
                    Clearly, the whole point of this <em>is</em> a test
                    assertion DSL? Agree with you that creating this by putting
                    methods onto Object feels much less acceptable to my
                    non-ruby/smalltalk mind. But ok, maybe someday I'll go the
                    rest of the way in this DSL fervor.

                        Apparently they aren't willing to hack the language
                        interpreter a little to improve their testing? py.test
                        does some cleverness to reinterpret assert statements
                        and capture subexpressions, and in the process solves
                        the problem that a whole series of assertEqual/etc
                        methods are created to solve. Doctest solves it in a
                        slightly different way, by basically turning everything
                        into assertEqual (though the fact that is less general
                        can be a problem).

                        RSpec is doing something else besides this, I think. The
                        tutorial isn't completely up-to-date, so now you can
                        actually do
                        <tt class="docutils literal"
                            ><span class="pre">x.should.be.foo</span></tt
                        >
                        which I think is entirely equivalent to
                        <tt class="docutils literal"
                            ><span class="pre">assert</span>
                            <span class="pre">x.foo?</span></tt
                        >. Since these transformations are generally pretty easy
                        and obvious (and they are <em>supposed</em> to be easy
                        and obvious), I'm not sure what the advantage of the
                        RSpec style is. Maybe if I saw his presentation.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I do think it is or can be correct that &quot;Behavior
                        Driven Programming&quot; is different than just
                        &quot;Test Driven&quot; or unit testing. There really is
                        something different to starting with doctest than with
                        starting with unittest or py.test. It's closer to
                        acceptance testing; acceptance testing of the API, I
                        guess. Unit testing tends to be more focused on testing
                        the internals. By emphasizing a story, doctest is
                        encouraging you to talk about what things look like from
                        the outside. I expect that the style RSpec is
                        implementing is intended to do the same. But creating a
                        DSL for that seems like exactly the
                        <em>wrong</em> thing, because you aren't describing
                        something that anyone can use. When talking about an
                        API, you should be using the API, nothing more.

                            is how the API should work&quot;, so maybe I'm just
                            an early adopter of &quot;Behavior Driven
                            Testing&quot;? :) Although, I thought I was just
                            doing good Test Driven Development... but my point
                            is, TDD freaks people out almost as much as Pair
                            Programming, so if someone wants to try a new name,
                            I'm ok with that.

                            nice thing in Python. Sure it's really just TDD, but
                            it's changing the semantics to encourage good TDD
                            practices instead of just a verification mechanism.

            <p>
                I think you hit the nail on the head there. I've messed around
                with both TDD and BDD in Ruby, and, as you'd expect, neither
                seems to do anything that the other can't do.
            </p>

            <p>
                BDD just uses different language in an attempt to encourage good
                testing practices. It's the kind of thing that's easy to
                downplay, but of course the only difference between any two
                general programming languages are the things that their syntaxes
                encourage and discourage.
