                >
                on all my &quot;active&quot; projects. But I don't use the
                scripts as regularly as I should, nor do I keep the list of
                active projects up to date. And it's all kind of vague anyway --
                I run lots of things from svn checkouts even if I am not
                necessarily tracking every development on the project.
            </p>
            <p>
                I'm also curious about tools built on Subversion for handling
                branches better. One of the commenters points to
                <a
                    class="reference"
                    href="http://subclipse.tigris.org/branch_tag.html"
                    >Subclipse</a
                >, which uses a property to track tags. But it doesn't seem to
                describe what exactly it is doing and what that tag means.
                <a class="reference" href="http://svk.elixus.org/">svk</a> also
                uses a special property for tracking merges, which is probably
                better documented. I'm curious how half-heartedly I can use svk
                (<a
                    class="reference"
                    href="http://svk.elixus.org/?SVKForSubversion"
                    >this page isn't actually that helpful</a
                >) -- can I just use it as a better frontend to Subversion? Will
                it work okay if other developers aren't using svk?
            </p>
            <p>
                Indexing of repositories and general tracking also remains
                relevent, both locally (what do I track?) and globally (what
                versions of things exist out there?)
            </p>
            <p>
                Incidentally, I would be very interested to hear how exactly
                people are using svn (or svk) on their machines. Like, the
                play-by-play of every non-obvious command they use, script they
                have, or whatever.

            <div class="document">
                <p>
                    A while ago I wrote a entry called
                    <a
                        class="reference"
                        href="http://www.tummy.com/journals/entries/jafo_20060102_172958"
                        >Subversion is a gateway drug</a
                    >. In general, my version control needs were fairly modest,
                    and I tried to keep them that way. However, for some recent
                    projects we have 2 to 3 people modifying code, and have the
                    code in a few different versions. I had to do some branching
                    to fold in changes to the stable version while doing
                    development changes as well.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I found that, in general, even with cvs2svn doing the wrong
                    thing with non-text files, it was easier to convert from CVS
                    to SVN and branch, than to branch the CVS. I always ended up
                    running problems with &quot;branch is not a sticy tag&quot;
                    that I couldn't get resolved...
                </p>
                <p>
                    However, once I had branches, I started wanting to use them,
                    and found that merging between branches was quite painful. I
                    really have to have at least two branches, with all changes
                    from one being merged into the other, and sometimes going
                    the other direction when changes are ready. Really I want a
                    tree of branches where changes at a higher level flow down
                    to a lower level. That would be ideal.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I was looking at other systems, and finally with the help of
                    Jeremy Hinegardner and Duncan McGreggor, I switched to
                    darcs, and have been liking it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Basically, with darcs, you can check out one working tree
                    into another. Each of these is a self-sufficient repository.
                    The repositories can be local or remote. So, I can have a
                    parent repository and then children can &quot;darcs
                    pull&quot; from their parents. I can also cherry-pick
                    patches to push back up-stream. For me, that's a much less
                    frequent thing, so that can be much more difficult. It's
                    keeping the children up with the parents that happens
                    frequently.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I like that I have a full local copy of the repository. It
                    makes doing releases insanely easy and fast, plus I can do
                    commits and tags without needing net access.
                </p>
                <p>
                    However, pushing and pulling from a remote repository can be
                    real slow. Slower than svn at least.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I should try svk at some point. Really all I'd like to see
                    is good branch merging support. I know you can do tricks to
                    follow branches, but those seem like they require
                    remembering much more and are more prone to errors.

                    svk works fine as an svn frontend. You don't even need to
                    use the local mirroring stuff if you don't want to (though
                    it is handy). Merge tracking (via smerge) is a godsend. I've
                    found it's pretty smart about doing the right thing even
                    when the other committers are using straight SVN.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The thing to keep in mind is that it's <em>not</em> a
                    substitue for good repo practices. You still want branches,
                    etc (treating your local mirror like a private branch just
                    isn't a good idea).
                </p>
                <p>
                    I wonder if you could avoid the need to edit tags via clever
                    use of SVN keywords &amp; a little python string
                    transformation?

                    I use svk exactly for that: a better branch merger. I
                    usually keep local mirrors and merge between those (I keep
                    my own branches in my own SVN repositories for upstream
                    stuff, so that I can easily keep local modifications). So
                    svk is a real godsend for any way of forking, even if it is
                    just for your own convenience. Actually I _only_ do the
                    merging and fork-handling in svk, everything else is done
                    with standard svn - that's mostly because svk is dog-slow on
                    my OS X machines.

                    I tried using svk as a front-end to Python's svn repository
                    (as recommended by Fredrik Lundh on his blog), but after
                    bizarre error messages (it's not that often that I see Perl
                    tracebacks) I decided that whilst tools like bazaar are also
                    badly documented, at least they manage to complete
                    operations in the advertised &quot;how to&quot; documents
                    without crashing inexplicably.

                <p>
                    Personally, I wish that the developers of &quot;next
                    generation&quot; revision control systems would spend some
                    time writing documentation, rather than leaving it to others
                    to write terse command sequences that &quot;worked for
                    them&quot;, or just referring everyone to the tool that
                    inspired the latest effort.

                    You can reduce this process to two commits (and not have to
                    edit the tag) by including the version bump during the
                    branch copy. Check out a clean version of trunk, modify the
                    version number locally and make your src '.' while doing an
                    svn copy. You'll get a clean commit like this:

                        Thanks, that would save the need for a checkout of the
                        tag as well.

                        In theory it should be doable with one commit, but I
                        don't know how to actually do that without having an
                        actual checkout of the tags directory, which is not
                        really feasible.

                    The technique I've used most is to have a 'make-release'
                    script that takes the repository path or tag, picks the
                    version out of the path or tag, exports the project, inserts
                    the version into the right places (setup.py here), and
                    creates the release tarball and whatnot. I have an older
                    version of the script (my pre-Python days!) with a CVS
                    mini-HOWTO with the whole release process,

                        has several of these features, though I haven't used
                        them all (I use setuptools' PyPI uploading, and don't
                        bother with the announce feature in buildutils either).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I actually want the checkout to be usable -- which means
                        a proper version (which becomes much more important with
                        setuptools and
                        <tt class="docutils literal"
                            ><span class="pre">python</span>
                            <span class="pre">setup.py</span>

                        >), so the version fixup has to happen in the
                        repository, not just at build time. There's still
                        versions in the documentation, though. Some of these are
                        unresolveable by any automated process (e.g., NEWS).

                    <p>
                        Anyway, with buildutils it's a pretty clean release
                        process:
