                upon this:
            </p>
            <blockquote>
                <p>
                    I react strongly against the thought that we need to provide
                    children with only a set of intellectual processes -- a dry,
                    contentless set of tools that they can go about applying. I
                    believe that the tools cannot help developing once children
                    have something real to think about; and if they don't have
                    anything real to think about, they won't be applying tools
                    anyway. That is, there really is no such thing as a
                    contentless intellectual tool. If a person has some
                    knowledge at his disposal, he can try to make sense of new
                    experiences and new information related to it. He fits it
                    into what he has. By knowledge I do not mean verbal
                    summaries of somebody else's knowledge. I am not urging
                    textbooks and lectures. I mean a person's own repertoire of
                    thoughts, actions, connections, preductions, and feelings.
                    Some of these may have as their source something read or
                    heard. But the individual has done the work of putting them
                    together for himself or herself, and they give rise to new
                    ways to put them together.

                A little earlier I was reading an article
                <a
                    class="reference"
                    href="http://www.greenstar.org/butterflies/Hole-in-the-Wall.htm"

                >
                which I found very interesting, and saw some connection here:
            </p>
            <blockquote>
                <p>
                    Well, I tried another experiment. I went to a middle-class
                    school and chose some ninth graders, two girls and two boys.
                    I called their physics teacher in and asked him, &quot;What
                    are you going to teach these children next year at this
                    time?&quot; He mentioned viscosity. I asked him to write
                    down five possible exam questions on the subject. I then
                    took the four children and said, &quot;Look here guys. I
                    have a little problem for you.&quot; They read the questions
                    and said they didn't understand them, it was Greek to them.
                    So I said, &quot;Here's a terminal. I'll give you two hours
                    to find the answers.&quot;
                </p>
                <p>
                    Then I did my usual thing: I closed the door and went off
                    somewhere else.
                </p>
                <p>
                    They answered all five questions in two hours. The physics
                    teacher checked the answers, and they were correct. That, of
                    itself, doesn't mean much. But I said to him, &quot;Talk to
                    the children and find out if they really learned something
                    about this subject.&quot; So he spent half an hour talking
                    to them. He came out and said, &quot;They don't know
                    everything about this subject or everything I would teach
                    them. But they do know one hell of a lot about it. And they
                    know a couple of things about it I didn't know.&quot;
                </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
                One of the most exciting things about OLPC is simply about
                bringing internet access to these children. The internet is a
                tool, not an ends, but it's one hell of a tool. It's limited
                because it is <em>just</em> content, it is not the kind of
                informed and wordly intellectual toolset Duckworth talks about.
                The problem with the laptop is that it is far better at
                conveying information than process, so it is very possible it
                could become <em>just</em> a textbook, and children would only
                interact by creating &quot;verbal summaries of somebody else's
                knowledge&quot;. This particularly resonates with me, because
                that style of education was particularly frustrating to me as a
                student.
            </p>
            <p>
                The good thing about the laptop (combined with the internet) is
                that the internet has such an overwhelming quantity of
                information it doesn't work well for textbook-style education.
                You don't read the internet and then answer questions to check
                your reading comprehension. Even a more constrained set of
                content like Wikipedia is structured in a non-linear form; you
                can't make it linear even if you want to.
            </p>
            <p>
                Of course you can still put a textbook online. You can still
                force students to read it linearly and respond to it in a
                controlled and limited way. The internet and this laptop are not
                coercive, and they can't force instructors to do something. They
                can only help clear a path to a better kind of education; of
                that I'm optimistic.

                    Constructivist educational theories are wonderful, but I
                    think it is still important to approach the OLPC project
                    from a critical distance. To caricature the current laptop
                    deployment plan, OLPC is essentially going to airdrop a few
                    million laptops into these countries and rely on the
                    children's intrinsic curiosity to crack open the clamshell
                    and start tinkering with these tools. One cynical response I
                    have heard to this project is that educators have succeeded
                    in providing most children in the world with the technology
                    of pencil and paper, and that has not resulted in a rise of
                    world literacy.
                </p>
                <p>
                    From what I understand, OLPC is

                    focusing on the development of curriculums and strategies
                    for teachers to effectively integrate these new tools in
                    their classroom, or encouraging the exchange of these
                    practices as they emerge. Radical constructivism might wish
                    away the classroom (and its associated hierarchy), but it is
                    still the organizational structure shaping education in most
                    of the world. It would certainly be a shame if the laptop
                    ended up in a cubby during the for the entire schoolday
                    because faculty did not have a clear idea what to do with
                    the tool.

                    I am reminded of a recent occasion where I heard Seymor

                    the concept of a mathematical theorem and introduce the
                    foundations of calculus. The trouble was, Seymor is one of
                    the few teachers able to do this with logo. My sixth grade
                    logo teacher had us doodling and scribbling - arguably we
                    learned a bit about programming and control structures, but
                    the unstructured play time did not translate into
                    mathematical insights. Perhaps the lesson here is that a
                    good teacher can make any instrument sing and dance, but not
                    everyone is a good teacher, and I am not convinced that logo
                    was a demonstrated constructivist success story.

                    Providing the third world with access to the Internet
                    certainly has an incredible ammount of potential. But don't
                    confuse potential good for actual good. It is dangerous not
                    to question the idea that technology and access to
                    information necessarily lead to greater social justice and
                    good in the world. We should be asking ourselves what we can
                    do to help insure the OLPC doesn't just end up bringing porn

                        Sounds like a kind of dumb response too. Literacy rates
                        <em>have</em> risen (if you account for our
                        ever-more-stringent definitions of literacy). Some
                        educational pessimism is just delusionally critical,
                        spouting untruths that are simply absurd but seem to
                        have gained traction due to sloppy thinking, like ideas
                        that our educational outcomes have been slipping over
                        time. Is pencil and paper responsible for the increases
                        in literacy? I dunno, but <em>lack</em> of pencil and
                        paper certainly can't help.

                        These kinds of critisms are unconstructive and

                        full of negative energy and cynicism that they are
                        simply lost causes. They cannot be convinced because
                        they are all too willing to switch to another criticism
                        when the last one is satisfied.

                        I don't think you are such a person, but I would prefer
                        you not use their arguments even in a devil's advocate
                        role. (I also hate the devil's advocate role, as I find
                        it intellectual dishonest; self-labelling dishonesty
                        does not excuse dishonesty! Speculating on negative

                        OLPC is very much focusing on hardware right now. From
                        what I can tell, curriculum development is outside of
                        OLPC's scope and ability, and it's not something OLPC
                        will be trying to develop. OLPC will be building the
                        software infrastructure to go with the laptop, which
                        will provide the context in which curriculum is
                        developed. (As an open source platform, even that
                        infrastructure could be thrown away if people really
                        don't like it.)

                        This infrastructure work is very strongly informed by
                        the collaboration found on the web and in wikis.
                        Certainly the exchange of ideas among teachers will be a
                        very important part of this infrastructure.

                        don't confuse potential good for actual good. It is
                        dangerous not to question the idea that technology and
                        access to information necessarily lead to greater social
                        justice and good in the world.

                        Certainly it's important to think about this. But OLPC
                        is also a leap of faith, and <em>must</em> be so. It is
                        not a tool to make the classrooms of developing nations
                        look like the classrooms of industrial nations. It is
                        not an effort to come up with the perfect curriculum or
                        teaching philosophy that can reform education and the
                        world. These are not reasonable goals, and may not be
                        very positive goals.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As a result, OLPC cannot have concrete and specific
                        educational goals. It is a tool, and we do not know how
                        it will be used; we <em>cannot</em> know how it will be
                        used because that would necessarily exclude the laptop
                        users from determining how they will use it.

                    <p>
                        Obviously the laptop could be used for negative ends. It
                        could simply reinforce current power structures, or
                        cause familial collapse, or any number of bad things.
                        Trusting in the good of human nature, I am very
                        optimistic about empowering individuals through the
                        laptop. Because of the nature of the project, it really
                        does empower the individual more than any institution.
                        The fundamental goals of the laptop project focus very
                        much on this; having one laptop per child, teachers
                        using a system that is a peer to the other laptops, a
                        relatively unconstrained environment, and an emphasis on
                        peer communication. I trust individuals.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To force any particular outcome would undo the laptop's
                        most noble goals, in my opinion. The outcome of
                        individual self-determination must be unknown, otherwise
                        it is not truly self-determined.

                        Of course there are many practical issues involved with
                        the laptop, and we can see at least many of them in how
                        children are effected by the internet currently. We're
                        very concerned about spam, security, and there's a lot
                        of questions about what degree a child should be exposed
                        to a larger world, one which may be predatory or just
                        manipulative. I doubt we'll figure this out before the
                        laptop is released, in part because the problems will
                        probably only emerge some time after the laptop is out.
                        But we can probably predict much of it -- as is often
                        the case in the developing world, we'll see many of the
                        same issues that the industrial nations have
                        experienced, just delayed a bit.

                        Constructive (and especially concrete) input on these
                        issues is very much appreciated. If I seem snippy at the
                        top of this (and I probably am), it's only in response
                        to a certain kind of unconstructive criticism that OLPC
                        seems to be getting a lot of.

                            Just to be clear - I am very excited about this
                            project and its potential, and I would like to
                            believe that I am contributing constructively to its
                            positive impact. There are plenty of very wise and
                            experienced people who I respect immensely who have
                            claimed that OLPC is one of the most important and
                            trans formative projects happening right now. Other
                            people I know seem to be hedging their optimism
                            (cautiously optimistic?), holding their cards close
                            waiting to see how the early phases of this project
                            pan out. But I think you are onto something
                            important with the idea that what is needed here is
                            a leap of faith, not cynicism. This could be the
                            most appropriate response to the skeptics.

                            As for concrete suggestions, I think that
                            educational schools should be jumping at the
                            opportunity to engage this project, and should
                            already be running graduate seminars arguing about
                            and designing OLPC applications. Conferences and
                            panels should be assembled, and people - educators,
                            developers, students, parents - should be imagining
                            and asking themselves what they would want this tool
                            to be used for. Organizations should be
                            independently seeking out their own funding sources,
                            for their own projects around the laptop, not
                            relying on OLPC for permission, blessing, or
                            authority. And, of course, the spirit and tradition
                            of free culture permits and encourages just this.
                            Anyone can get involved. There is no
                            &quot;they&quot;, just a &quot;we&quot; that needs
                            to will these changes into existence.

                            If all goes according to the OLPC plan, the laptop
                            may become a vital communications channel, separate
                            from the internet. I can imagine educational
                            materials deployed to the laptop, in situations
                            where the intenet has not yet reached the target
                            audience. Since the laptop supports USB devices, and
                            also automatically creates a mesh, a single
                            thumbnail drive could provide the content for an
                            entire village. I can imagine a proliferation of
                            thumbnail curriculum that rivals PSP cartridges on
                            NYC subways.

                            necessarily bringing with it freedom, democracy, and
                            equality. How can we be sure that our faith is not a
                            blind faith? That our optimism is well placed, and
                            not naive and giddy?

                                With a project like OLPC, it is common to see
                                people come in asking for permission to do stuff
                                (usually not using the term

                                like that going on). And in typical free culture
                                style, they are met with indifference. I'm
                                afraid this is very discouraging, but of course
                                there are important reasons for it too; a loose
                                community in this style just doesn't have the
                                time (or maybe more accurately attention) to
                                hold people's hands, to make investments in
                                people that aren't necessarily going to pan out,
                                etc. So we wait for something concrete to
                                emerge, and then praise it then.

                                computers as constructivist tools really matter?
                                For a lot of curriculum, I still don't know how
                                to answer that. I like Logo, I think imperative
                                programming in general is a far superior way to
                                teach pre-algebra and algebra over traditional
                                declarative math... but even if that can work it
                                <em>doesn't matter</em> for these audiences.
                                Algebra barely matters in the US (for most
                                people far less than probability and statistics,
                                for instance). Maybe trig is useful.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Anyway, I think it's a big leap to making these
                                things important in these communities. For some
                                subset of children they will be, just like for a
                                subset of children these things are important
                                here. As a programmer I want to build more
                                programmers, just the natural self-obsession
                                everyone has. But realistically programming and
                                similar formal systems aren't going to be the
                                important thing.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                But if we ignore all the programming and
                                constructivist learning and whatnot, and just
                                think about content and communication, it's not
                                hard to see how important these computers can
                                be. Educational content for adults perhaps --
                                but just as much, the children can become a
                                conduit for important information getting to
                                their families. Basic medical information, for
                                instance (and hopefully more than just the
                                purely cautionary/preventative information we
                                are inundated with here, but actual constructive
                                and useful information about diagnosis and
                                causes). And there's all sorts of mundane but
                                important things... price quotes on food
                                markets, employment listings, government
                                services... everything we do here means
                                something there too, our worlds aren't so
                                different. And as mundane as these things are,
                                they are part of a larger network of information
                                and skill which are the basis of any real
                                constructivist learning -- you don't construct
                                knowledge and concepts from the ether, you
                                construct them from the world around you.

                                I don't know if adults will work directly with

                                the idea of children as intermediaries.

                                Absolutely. There's some &quot;can vs.
                                should&quot; discussions about OLPC. But
                                personally I believe, if the intentions are good
                                and the implementation competent,
                                &quot;can&quot; and &quot;should&quot; are
                                usually the same thing. Because there's lots of
                                people with self-serving intentions that are
                                working hard all the time, so there is no

                                I was reading a textbook on international labor
                                policy several years back, and they had a little
                                snippet of an interview with a textile
                                manufacturer in El Salvador. They were very
                                happy with computers and databases, because they
                                allowed them to track union organizers and
                                blacklist them cooperatively in all their
                                factories. All of us involved in technology are
                                helping people do things like that, indirectly
                                but inevitably. And there's a lot of defense
                                contractors using Python, so we are indirectly
                                helping build the instruments of death. That's
                                depressing. We have to push forward, and push
                                forward <strong>hard</strong> to do the right
                                things with technology, because there's people
                                pushing forward hard to do the wrong things.

                        <p>Hello,</p>
                        <p>really thanks you for doing work for OPLC.</p>
                        <p>
                            I feel very concerned about helping third world
                            countries developping. I myself spent two years in
                            Ivory Coast and had different contact with person
                            immersed in this reality.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Here is what I would attract your attention upon :
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            On a project such as OPLC I think you really got to
                            relie upon association with a strong experience and
                            reflexion in the domain. I mean Caritas and the like
                            (excuse me for citing religious one but it's the one
                            I know best). For example I feel Unicef alone is not
                            competent enough because too far from the battle
                            field (although their work is important too).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            If you won't do, you expose yourself to be deeply
                            deceipt. That would be a shame. For example
                            experience shows that you always have to ask for
                            committment of the receiver for the project to be
                            fruictfull. If you don't ask anything for a computer
                            (maybe small thing, maybe not money), they will end
                            in a parrallel black market, or in the rubish ! You
                            also have to take into account society/cultural
                            aspects countries by countries. eg. Congo is not
                            Ivory Coast...
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Personnaly, as a first go, my prefered strategie
                            would be to provide OPLC to as much non-governmental
                            organizations as possible and let them bring
                            projects with it.

                            which gave them links for hooking up with Web sites
