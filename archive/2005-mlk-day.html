                <p>
                    &quot;I call on every man and woman of good will all over
                    America today ...to take a stand on this issue. Tomorrow may
                    be too late. The book may close. Don't let anyone make you
                    think that God chose America as his divine messianic force,
                    to be a sort of policeman of the whole world. God has a way
                    of standing before the nations with judgement, and it seems
                    that I can hear God saying to America 'You are too arrogant!
                    If you don't change your ways, I will rise up and break the
                    backbone of your power! And I will place it in the hands of
                    a nation that doesn't even know my name. Be still and know
                    that I am God.'&quot;
