                Sigh... I've decided that
                <a class="reference" href="http://pydispatcher.sourceforge.net/"
                    >PyDispatcher</a
                >
                is probably the right thing for
                <a class="reference" href="events-and-sqlobject.html"
                    >SQLObject events</a
                >
                -- I think it's a predictable and easy-to-understand package for
                this context, and I really prefer phrasing this in terms of
                events. But PyDispatcher conflicts with
                <a
                    class="reference"
                    href="http://www-128.ibm.com/developerworks/library/l-cppeak2/"
                    >RuleDispatch</a
                >, because they both use the package
                <tt class="docutils literal"
                    ><span class="pre">dispatch</span></tt
                >. Not a problem unless you want to use them both at once. Which
                is certain to happen, since TurboGears added the JSON code
                <a class="reference" href="first-try-at-generic-functions.html"
                    >I mentioned</a
                >
                (that uses RuleDispatch), and also uses SQLObject.
            </p>
            <p>
                This is annoying. Maybe I'll think again about using
                RuleDispatch... but I feel unnecessarily forced into the
                decision.

                    It is much simpler than PyDispatcher, and may suit your

                        PyDispatcher isn't that complicated, really. Not very
                        complicated at all, at least when I consider what I want
                        to do with it. And it seems better documented than
                        FibraNet.

                    I agree with the general lament: that an unambiguous
                    namespace means having to deal with packages that have the
                    same name.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You can, of course, get around that in any specific code
                    with
                    <tt class="docutils literal"
                        ><span class="pre">import</span>
                        <span class="pre">foo</span>
                        <span class="pre">as</span>
                        <span class="pre">bar</span></tt
                    >.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In this specific case, though, should the JSON code just be
                    reimplemented using PyDispatcher? I must admit to sharing
                    your preference for the simple, hugely flexible
                    PyDispatcher.

                        I may be a little naive about event dispatching
                        mechanisms, but when it comes to simplicity, how simple
                        can they get, and exactly what flexibility is required?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I've used FibraNet (back when it was just called
                        'EventNet'), the event/signal mechanism in PGU, and
                        PyDispatcher. From my experience, EventNet was the most
                        simple. One line to post an event:
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        eventnet.driver.post('my_event', arg1=something,
                        arg2=something_else)
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        and one line to register a callable to receive an event:
                    </p>
                    <p>&#64;eventnet.driver.subscribe('my_event')</p>
                    <p>
                        def my_event_handler(event): print event.name,
                        event.arg1, event.arg2
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        EventNet does force you to keep track of references, and
                        explicitly unsubscribe event handlers, as it does not
                        use weak references. This can result in some extra code.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I've found writing code like this can be either very
                        elegant, or very confusing. This situation gets
                        amplified (for better or worse) once you start using the
                        eventnet.net module, which works well for simple IPC,
                        though I do not know how safe it is.

                    <p>
                        I am curious, how exactly are you planning to use an
                        event dispatcher in SQLObject, and what problems will it
                        help solve?

                            It's not a decorator, but that would be very easy to
                            implement. PyDispatcher also has has the concept of
                            &quot;sender&quot;, which I find useful, as I'm
                            actually expecting to listen to events on a
                            per-class basis (and SQLObject classes are the
                            senders).

                        <p>
                            The events I'm proposing are listed in
                            <a

                            part of how basic concepts like joins and columns
                            are implemented. E.g., a column with a
                            <tt class="docutils literal"
                                ><span class="pre">cascade=True</span></tt

                        PyDispatcher doesn't really apply to the JSON code, so
                        that's not an option. The name conflict doesn't help,
                        because you simply can't have two distributions loaded

                        repackaging the libraries, at which point I could just

                                from our earlier discussion the two packages can
                                actually be dumped into the same directory and
                                both continue to function as expected.

                    You know, you <em>could</em> package one or the other so
                    it's a namespace package, as long as there aren't any
                    conflicting names <em>within</em> the two
                    <tt class="docutils literal"

                    >
                    packages. Just add something like:
                </p>
                <pre class="literal-block">
try:
    from pkg_resources import declare_namespace
except ImportError:
    pass
else:
    declare_namespace(__name__)
</pre
                >
                <p>
                    to the end of both
                    <tt class="docutils literal"

                    I agree, this situation is unfortunate. I would gladly
                    support any solution that will make it easier for people to
                    use both packages. In the mean time, what we have done with
                    Schevo is simply included pydispatcher as a subpackage of
                    schevo. Call it a fork, if you will. Then we use it like
                    this:
                </p>
                <pre class="literal-block">
from schevo.dispatcher import dispatcher
from schevo.dispatcher.errors import DispatcherKeyError
</pre
                >
                <p>
                    I don't think this is the ideal solution. And certainly Eggs
                    makes dependency management much more palatable than it used
                    to be, so someone may come up with something better. But if
                    a simple solution isn't forthcoming, then sometimes you just
                    do what you gotta do. You would not offend me in the
                    slightest if you took the same approach with SQLObject. :-)

                        Yeah, I'm thinking about doing that as well. I could
                        repackage it as
