                say to together!
            </p>
            <p>
                I've been having a lot of fun with the
                <a class="reference" href="http://chipy.org">ChiPy</a> lately,
                we've got a pretty good group going. There's actually a number
                of us using Python in our jobs, but the group isn't
                professional. Those of us who use it in our jobs do so because
                we have autonomy, and there's not much difference between that
                and the hobbyists, because either way we enjoy what we're doing.
                It's fun because it's not professional. Java groups are
                professional and they are <em>booooring</em>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Professionalism is a facade that allows you to build working
                relationships. But we can base our relationships on better
                things than professionalism:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p class="first">
                        Respect for the people you work with, including your
                        customers. Maybe you don't agree with them, maybe you
                        don't consider them peers in some of the things you do,
                        but you appreciate <em>something</em> about them. That
                        something is what you build a relationship on, and you
                        try to avoid the other stuff.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p class="first">
                        Empathy for the people you work with. Sympathy (to
                        contrast) implies a value judgement, an emotional
                        response, but empathy is really just a rational
                        response. Empathy means you work to understand their
                        perspective and desires.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p class="first">
                        A conscious acknowledgement and appreciation of the
                        institution that brings you together. When we are part
                        of a decision-making process for an institution
                        (including the ad hoc decisions we make during our
                        working day) we must make those decisions as
                        representatives of the institution.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        However, there is an opposite extreme, where the
                        decision-maker ignores the individuals that make up the
                        institution, include ignoring self. I can make decisions
                        that I personally object to, like the use of proprietary
                        software in some circumstances. However, I shouldn't
                        deny that at the same time, I will still object to the
                        very decision I am making, and that objection will have
                        real consequences in my own work. I can become
                        disinvested in my own decisions -- a peculiar and
                        dangerous circumstance. I should accept that my
                        self-investment is not absolute even when I am
                        responsible for making a decision, and that in turn
                        effects the institution. Isolated criteria (like the
                        profit motive) are incomplete and inaccurate.
                        Professionalism can be a way of isolating ourselves from
                        our personal motivations.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p class="first">
                        Courtesy and etiquette are still important. They are
                        symbolic, but they symbolic of an underlying respect,
                    </p>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                OK, I'm just making this up as I go along. But I think there's a
                lot of alternative models to professionalism.

                    No, but seriously... To hell with the enterprise. I've been
                    sitting around for years waiting for dynamic languages to
                    gain acceptance in the enterprise. I figured it takes even
                    the best technology a little time before it's going to be
                    integrated into the status quo. But I'm beginning to think
                    that the only thing standing in the way is
                    dynamic-languages-are-scary-and-unprofessional FUD.

                        While I totally agree with both of you on your views of
                        'enterprise' applications (10 years working for a govt.
                        dept. will do that to you), I do think Ryan is being
                        completely unfair to the original article.

                        &quot;[C]hoosing another Web framework <em>can</em>
                        <em>seem</em> strange or unprofessional.
                        <em>However</em>, there are many viable alternatives on
                        the market.&quot; (emphasis mine)

                    <p>
                        Dropping the context does make his initial statement
                        seem declarative in a way that clearly wasn't intended.
                        To stop after the <em>very first line</em> of an article
                        that goes on to show the power of a specific dynamic
                        language, just to criticise that introduction, almost
                        makes it look like you were waiting for this fight. He's
                        not aiming this article at people who are already
                        utilising Python, Ruby et.al, he's <em>very</em> clearly
                        addressing it to those for whom J2EE development
                        <em>is</em> the be-all-end-all.

                        Clearly the author sees direct value in using Ruby, so
                        it's possible he might even agree with you, otherwise
                        he'd be spending his time on Java articles. This wasn't
                        &quot;grandstanding&quot;, this was writing to an
                        audience. The <em>last</em> thing we need is for Java
                        developers to see the &quot;other camps&quot; get all
                        pissy about an out-of-context remark. Let's choose our
                        battles with a bit more care.

                            You're being too generous here. Even without the
                            context, the use of the word &quot;seem&quot; in the

                            Oh, I wouldn't take it that far. I think he was just
                            bothered that the author of the article felt a need
                            to apologize for a productive, dynamic, less-formal
                            language. Ryan's point, I think, is that in fact
                            these less-formal languages aren't just
                            theoretically superior, they are demonstrably
                            superior; formalist languages are full of hype, but
                            when you look at the real software that we use (in
                            the case of the web, indirectly) it's not Java, and
                            Java doesn't deserve to be some gold standard for
                            technology comparisons. Even by
                            &quot;professional&quot; standards (which as joeg
                            pointed out, don't actually exist) Java doesn't
                            deserve particular authority compared to other
                            traditional systems like Perl or PHP. And Ruby is
                            not strange at all compared to Perl or PHP.

                <p>
                    Years ago there was an article where a judge declared that
                    programmers were not professionals. If I remember correctly,
                    a architecture company was trying to sue a software company
                    because a bug in their software had negatively affected a
                    project they were working on. According to the judge, they
                    couldn't sue the programmers because there was no
                    universally accepted professional standards. Unlike
                    engineering or accounting, there were no certifications that
                    could be used to judge the output therefore they could not
                    be sued for failure to meet those standards. The jist of the
                    article was that programmers were more akin to craftsmen or
                    artisans than to professionals. The judge was talking about
                    the defintion in a legal context - not in it's common usage.

                    I think it's been over a decade since that article came out.
                    Maybe things have changed since then but I haven't referred
                    to myself as a professional since then.

                        Software engineering... yeah, right! It's one thing to
                        build stuff out of concrete things. It's another thing
                        entirely to build abstract stuff atop hundreds of layers
                        of other abstract stuff, all running atop a real
                        concrete thing which is itself error prone and subject
                        to failures due to minimal variations in its phisical
                        conditions...

                    While this rant-fest is in progress, gonna take out all the
                    stops. Let's face it - all platforms for web development
                    suck. Period. But for different reasons.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Many of the dynamically typed offerings show amazing
                    promise... but don't look too closely. What's missing is
                    that final 20% for those &quot;exceptional use cases&quot;
                    which only a paid programmer will deliver e.g. unicode
                    support for PHP - who in their right mind would volunteer?
                </p>
                <p>
                    Meanwhile the dollars and column inches are still flowing to
                    technologies which appeal only to flagellants and terminally
                    stupid. Technologies where that final 20% <em>has</em> been
                    done (by someone who got paid) but have a general track
                    record, when it comes to <em>application</em> programming,
                    for delivering way over time if at all.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Today, every time I see someone put &quot;dynamically
                    typed&quot; and &quot;enterprise&quot; in the same block of
                    text, between the lines I'm reading &quot;give us some real
                    money and we'll <em>really</em> show you something&quot;.
                    That seems to be the chicken and the egg of a remark like
                    &quot;strange and unprofessional&quot;. Of course it's
                    strange and unprofessional! No one has fronted the bucks to
                    package it for &quot;enterprise fingers&quot;.
                </p>
                <p>
                    What's strangest of all, to me, is there still seems to be
                    no real sign of any of the big software houses really
                    getting behind a dynamically typed language. Sure there's
                    concessions like IronPython, JSR 223 and the article in
                    question but when did you last hear IBM touting
                    &quot;Websphere with Python, Perl, Ruby and PHP
                    support&quot;? It's tempting to suggest some kind of
                    conspiracy (e.g. strongly typed sells IDEs) but far more
                    likely is simple human falacy like the sales folk have got
                    too used to talking to managers instead of developers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The tradegy in all this comes by way of personal analogy.
                    Where I work (best left un-named) we have a number of
                    trainee software developers who are still studying while
                    working for us part-time. The brightest of the bunch, who
                    has all the hallmarks of an excellent developer, recently
                    told me, based on his &quot;enterprise experience&quot;,
                    that he won't be going into IT when he's finished his
                    studies. He doesn't know what he's going to do instead but
                    definately <em>not</em> IT. That's a huge waste, and not
                    only of his time.

                        So, if these big corps need to support their legacy
                        systems, and to support everything that they need they
                        go to great lengths of even opening their own
                        universities, how would they want to change everything
                        in the name of &quot;improved productivity&quot;, as it
                        was a goal at all. They want to simplify what they need
                        to support, while maintaining their status quo. That's
                        why a language like Java which can be run everywhere is
                        important. Train someone in it on a Windows machine and
                        he could be used to maintain something in big irons.
                        This big ball of mud won't stop getting bigger and
                        bigger. More systems, more softwares, more people
                        trained.

                    <p>
                        Why is that that when someone is not
                        &quot;professional&quot; he feels compelled to use
                        alternatives to what is used by the professionals? What
                        if someone has been a professional for a decade and then
                        decides to step aside and become something else? Maybe
                        he forgot what a professional should use?

                                Although that's PHP specific the statements that
                                stand out (given this is position-defining PR);

                                the simplicity of PHP is one of its greatest
                                assets

                                We're in a better position to look at a language
                                that fits people's background and what they want
                                to accomplish, rather than saying everything has
                                to be written in one particular language that
                                scales from easy-to-use to high-performance
                                systems&quot;
