        <div class="document">
            <p>
                Well, I've been getting back to
                <a class="reference" href="http://sqlobject.org">SQLObject</a>
                development a little lately. I realized there isn't a whole lot
                that needs to be done before an 0.7 release, so I'm trying to
                get everything ready for that.
            </p>
            <p>
                First, I put up a new site design. It's just like the
                <a class="reference" href="http://pythonpaste.org"
                    >new Paste design</a
                >
                but with different colors. I also added a
                <a class="reference" href="http://sqlobject.org/news/">blog</a>
                where I plan to make note of SQLObject-related stuff.
                Incidentally there's also a
                <a class="reference" href="http://pythonpaste.org/news/"
                    >Paste blog</a
                >. There's a CSS related problem that I don't understand with
                wrapping on those pages; if anyone has ideas... I'm also trying
                to
                <a class="reference" href="http://sqlobject.org/links.html"
                    >collect links to SQLObject-related articles and projects</a
                >; comment here if you see something that is missing.
            </p>
            <p>
                The big change in 0.7 will be the introduction of the
                <tt class="docutils literal"
                    ><span class="pre">.sqlmeta</span></tt
                >
                attribute that holds most of the metadata. This gives a
                <a
                    class="reference"
                    href="http://sqlobject.org/docs/interface.py.html"
                    >formal public interface</a
                >
                for introspection that has been missing for some time. I'm also
                starting a more formal deprecation process; 0.7 shouldn't break
                0.6 code, but you'll start getting warnings. With a public,
                stable API for introspection I hope to rebuild bits and pieces
                of SQLObject using that API (and a couple other
                metaclass-related protocols I'll add after 0.7). No radical
                rewrites, just creating new structures to replace the old, even
                though they will live happily alongside the old pieces.
            </p>
            <p>
                Besides lots of bug fixes (which were all applied by
                <a class="reference" href="http://phd.pp.ru/">Oleg</a>, so I
                haven't kept track of them at all) the other major feature is
                probably the as-yet-undocumented
                <tt class="docutils literal"
                    ><span class="pre">sqlobject-admin</span></tt
                >
                command-line management tool. It still has some serious rough
                edges, but I think it's got a lot of potential. It helps you
                create your tables, which is fine, but the more interesting
                feature is how it can track the deployed versions your database
                schema and apply updates.
            </p>
            <p>
                Automatically updating a database is a Very Hard Problem. I
                think
                <tt class="docutils literal"
                    ><span class="pre">sqlobject-admin</span></tt
                >
                tackles the problem in a good, tool-based manner, avoiding any
                cleverness. You run
                <tt class="docutils literal"
                    ><span class="pre">sqlobject-admin</span>
                    <span class="pre">record</span></tt
                >
                and it will save the SQL of all your tables (if it's any
                different from the last recorded version). If you add
                <tt class="docutils literal"
                    ><span class="pre">--edit</span></tt
                >
                then it creates an upgrade file and opens it in an editor;
                you'll have to give the statements for upgrading the database on
                your own (that's the Very Hard Problem if you try to do it
                automatically), but it will show you a diff of what's changed in
                this version which usually makes it trivial to write the SQL.
            </p>
            <p>
                Then
                <tt class="docutils literal"
                    ><span class="pre">sqlobject-admin</span>
                    <span class="pre">upgrade</span></tt
                >
                applies any upgrading SQL scripts to the database, based on a
                special table in the database that gives its current version.
            </p>
            <p>
                Anyway, that's what's coming in 0.7. I mostly have to fix up and
                extend the documentation a bit, update the News file, fix a
                couple problems with
                <tt class="docutils literal"
                    ><span class="pre">sqlobject-admin</span></tt
                >, and then release. No heroic effort required, just some grunt
                work. Further news will go on that
                <a class="reference" href="http://sqlobject.org/news/">blog</a>.

                    and the other pages looks.. not good. Maybe it is the

                    This new LEFTJOIN stuff in sqlbuiler looks neat, I haven't
                    seen much reference to it yet. Fast joins that fit with
                    sqlobject syntax will be nice :-)
                </p>
                <p>
                    The only other feature I miss is a non-hackish way to access
                    the database directly and run custom queries, this sqlmeta
                    refactoring may help with that.

                        What's the issue with the wrapping on the other pages?
                        It's not perfect, but I didn't want the navigation menu
                        to take up the entire left column as the loss of
                        horizontal space is more of a problem with a long
                        document. But there might be other artifacts getting
                        through; floats are hard :(

                    Any plans to support MSSQL Server in the future? Just
                    curious as there doesn't seem to be a lot of support out

                        Some people have put in some initial work, and I think
                        it's in the repository. Proprietary databases are hard
                        to support, and so far people interested in developing
                        that support have tended to wander off. There is Sybase
                        support, which should be similar to MSSQL due to their
                        common ancestry. I personally wouldn't work on it unless
                        there was something work-related requiring it (and if
                        I'm involved in the technical decisions, I'd actively
                        avoid MSSQL anyway); while I would help SQLObject
                        support any open source database, even if I didn't use
                        it, I put very little priority on integrating with
                        proprietary software.

                            I respect your objection to using MSSQL. I even
                            agree with you to a point (PostgreSQL is great!),
                            although MSSQL has some very nice features including
                            extremely nice administration tools...but we won't
                            get into that discussion.

                            Moving on... Can you see value in allowing people to
                            use SQLObject by providing an easy way to connect to
                            MSSQL? It certainly doesn't hurt SQLObject to have
                            easy integration with MSSQL. I'd even argue that it
                            will improve the market share of SQLObject to have
                            that connector built in and ready to go. The last
                            thing most developers want (or have the ability) to
                            change when they are working on a database project
                            is the persistence layer. That means that most
                            people who are currently using MSSQL and looking for
                            a Python ORM will pass over SQLObject because it
                            doesn't work with MSSQL. You can hardly deny that
                            Microsoft has a LOT of market share, which means
                            that a lot of people won't be using SQLObject until
                            there is an easy way to use it with MSSQL.

                                I'm not going to <em>stop</em> anyone. I'll even
                                help, to some degree (maybe just a small one).
                                But features like this need a champion, and I
                                definitely won't be that champion.

                    For an extensive discussion on some of the issues involved
                    in programatically genertating schema upgrade scripts, see
                    this thread from the PostgreSQL mailing list:

                    I've been diffing my dumped create scripts and creating
                    upgrade scripts by hand as needed. Works ok, though I've got
                    a pretty small database - less than 30 tables.
