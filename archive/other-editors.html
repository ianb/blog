</div><h1>Other Editors?</h1>
 
<div class="document">
<p>So, I've used Emacs as long as I've used Unix, and it's generally
treated me well.  But sometimes I wonder if there's something out
there that might be better for me.  Remembering that I spend a <em>lot</em>
of time in a text editor, is there something else I should be looking at?</p>
<p>Some features I require:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Open source (and usable on Linux and FreeBSD of course).</li>
<li>Python scriptable (that's kind of the point of switching; preferable
if it's 100% Python).</li>
<li>Good handling of multiple files and windows; I like using Emacs with
a single editor instance, and sending requests to that instance to
open files and whatnot.  If the editor can't do this, it's probably
architecturally limited in such a way that I'll never be happy with
it.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some features I want but maybe don't need:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>All the standard stuff, source highlighting, supports a variety of
languages, incremental search, etc.</li>
<li>Good indenting support.  Does any editor do the kind of smart
indenting that Emacs does?  This isn't strictly required, but I bet
I'll be unhappy without it.</li>
<li>Emacs keybindings.</li>
<li>Remote editing over ssh.</li>
<li>Windows and Mac support.</li>
</ul>
<p>And of course:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Actively developed.</li>
</ul>
<p>I actually kind of doubt I'll drop Emacs, since I usually realize that
Emacs has features I didn't even realize I'm constantly using.  But I
thought I'd give it a try.  I'm not sure I'm up for Eclipse, though,
and if Emacs is showing its age then Vim is just showing a different sort of age.</p>
<p>Maybe to be helpful, these are things I don't care about:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>The toolkit -- GTK, Qt, Tk, wx, whatever.</li>
<li>IDE features (they don't necessarily hurt, but realistically I never use those features).</li>
<li>The visual appearance.</li>
<li>&quot;User friendliness&quot; in any traditional sense; I'm a serious user,
and traditional UI guidelines typically don't apply.  To give you some sense
of my perspective, I consider
Emacs to be one of the best user interfaces ever (given its target audience).
I want the <em>next</em> Emacs.</li>

<p>I hate to say it, but after going back and forth between Vim and {,X}Emacs a number of times I have to recommend Vim.  It's Open Source and Python scriptable, although I'm not sure if it's handling of multiple files and windows would fit your needs.  There's <cite>Vimacs_</cite> which provides Emacs keybinding for Vim (such an odd concept...).  Works over ssh, works on Windows and Macs, does smart indenting, has lots of Python-specific plugins.  As much as I loved Emacs, I find Vim (as opposed to vi, which is awful) a treat to work with.</p>

<p>I'm not sticking to a single editor, but I am sticking to a single key-binding. That key binding is Vi(m). I'm not saying it works for everybody, but here's my reasoning:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Vi is everywhere. If I ever need to edit text on an obscure platform, I can be productive.</li>
<li>It may not be for everyone, but I've found that modal editing works for me. I find it easier to switch modes and use simple key strokes than chording keys for even simple tasks like saving.</li>
<li>99% of my development is on Win32. I use Vim for simple stuff. For the .NET development I do, I'm evaluating ViEmu. This gives me all the functionality of Visual Studio (intellisense, build management, etc.) For Java (and possibly Python in the future, via PyDev), Eclipse has viPlugin. Both of these add-ons cost $$$, but the productivity boost is worth it to me.</li>
<li>Vim has much better support for Unicode than Emacs, at least at this point in time.</li>
<li>&quot;The Pragmatic Programmer&quot; says &quot;Learn one editor.&quot; By knowing the Vi(m) key bindings, this lets me be productive in all the editors I use on a daily basis.</li>
</ol>
<p>It took a long time for me to come down to this. I realized I wasn't going to be fully productive in any one editor, so learning common key bindings is the next best thing, IMO.</p>

<p>Just curious...does EMacs do real autocompletion for Python?</p>
<p>Right now I'm using SciTE, which does smartly indent.  I tried all those IDE's including Eric3 but they were much too slow.  SciTE is very fast, and allows me to jump to an exception instantly.  However no inline Python functions.</p>
<p>I think I'll try out that NewEdit.  It looks Scintilla based from the screenshots, but doesn't overdo it.  I'm glad you mentioned it!</p>

<p>Emacs doesn't have &quot;real&quot; python auto-completion, for some value of &quot;real&quot;.  But pycomplete is a start.  (requires pymacs.)  The default keybinding is C-M-i. You may have to fiddle $PYTHONPATH before starting emacs to get it to find things you want to complete. Annoyingly, it seems to be a bit all-or-nothing: if something imported in the current buffer isn't on $PYTHONPATH, you can't complete <em>anything</em>, and I don't know know any way to supplement $PYTHONPATH without exiting emacs and fixing it in the shell.  And pycomplete it doesn't work at all in filesystem Zope2 CMF

<p>jedit - <a class="reference" href="http://jedit.org/">http://jedit.org/</a>
As much as I try to switch to something else I find nothing else supports what I want from an editor. Probably the only java UI that isn't a train reck. I mainly use these plugins: session and buffer list. But the search in the tool bar is key! And multi window or multi view support is great. The number of syntax highlights is hudge even apache httpd.conf is in there.

<p>I also use jEdit; it has a Jython plugin so you can script it with Jython.  There's also a JPyDbg plugin that gives you remote Python source debugging from inside of jEdit.  Its Python mode indents when you hit enter after a colon, and it's fairly easy to configure sensible tab processing.  The hypersearch and project searches are useful, as is rectangular selection and editing.</p>
<p>Dunno if I'd compare it to Emacs exactly; for me it's better as I'd rather not have to spend so much time programming the editor to do useful things.  :)  But then, I haven't used Emacs in a long, long time.  I've only ever written two jEdit macros; one to automatically strip trailing whitespace from the current line whenever I hit enter, and one to insert blank lines until the current line's line number modulo 41 is 1.  (Don't ask.)  Anyway, everything else I've needed has already been there, or easy enough to do by hand.</p>

<p>For the record, regarding indenting, Emacs understands expressions and block terminators in addition to colon.  So this is Emacs indenting:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
def munge(x, y, z,
          kwarg=None):
    return {
        'x': x,
        'y': y,
        'rest': (z, kwarg),
        }
</pre>
<p>Emacs will indent the lines to exactly the position I show up there, and after the last line it won't indent at all (since the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">def</span></tt> is closed by the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">return</span></tt>).  Sometimes -- not often -- it gets it wrong.  Other times -- not often -- I don't like how it wants to indent my source.  In those cases it can be a little annoying, but mostly because I depend on it so much that it's hard to resist using it.  Emacs python-mode also has block indent and block dedent; in comparison to the automatic indenting this isn't a very sophisticated feature, but definitely something you want to have for Python.</p>
<p>(Is that line number modulo 41 the reason you have [what seems to me] strange chunks of verticle whitespace in your source?)</p>

<p>I could be wrong, but I believe the only other editor to come close to Emac's python mode indenting is Vim. Here's what vim looks like for your sample without any fixups:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
def munge(x, y, z,
        kwarg=None):
    return {
'x': x,
'y': y,
'rest': (z, keyarg),
}

and with fixups along the way (commented)

def munge(x, y, z,
          kwarg=None):      #space kwarg over 2
    return {
        'x': x,
        'y': y,
        'rest': (z, kwarg),
        }                   # left 2, tab 1
</pre>
<p>I suspect this could be fixed, but its low on my priority list. Favorite vim feature: tags support - between this and other doc / code lookup features I spend a lot less time clicking about other modules and packages, particularly those I rarely use.</p>
<p>Have used jedit extensively; eric3 as well - found the ubiquity of vim and the extensibility of gvim just too hard to live without. That said, I'm sure a blew a month getting vim configured how I like it and getting used to a modal editor. If its not a long term commitment its not worth going down the vim road I fear.</p>

<div class="document">
<p>I don't think anyone's taken over development.
It was sad, but I've moved back to using emacs
after using jedit for ~4 years. Here are some
pro/cons that I re-discovered, for out-of-the-box
experience (I realize you can &quot;do anything&quot; if
you code enough elisp, but that's not what I'm
talking about).</p>
<p>jedit pros:
1. GUI is nicer/exists - fonts, dialogs, etc.
2. (Simple) configuration is nicer.
3. Has more editing features readily available
(I hesitated to include this, given that I'm
comparing against <em>emacs</em>, but I did find that
I discovered useful features more easily by
browsing the jedit config/docs than with emacs
through apropos/texinfo)</p>
<p>emacs pros:
1. Editing modes are more polished - python,
and especially auctex.
2. Remote/console use.
3. Less memory intensive.</p>
<p>A con for both is still occasional unresponsiveness.
The reason that I left emacs to begin with was that
at the time I still read my mail through emacs, and
the fact that emacs was single-threaded meant that
whenever I did something &quot;intensive&quot;, e.g. open a
large mail folder, my entire emacs would stall.
I felt like I needed to move away from the emacs-
is-my-OS workflow. Now that I've come back to
emacs and use it soley as my editor, it's not
nearly as bad (and computers have gotten faster
in the meantime too :-), but I still find the
occasional inability to edit another buffer while
emacs does its thing annoying. On the other hand,
jedit, being a java app, seems to want a ridiculous
amount of memory, and hence I encountered random
hiccups from (I'm guessing) gc.</p>
<p>Anyways, I think the main advantages <em>and</em>
disadvantages of emacs stems from its age -
it has a lot of nifty polished packages,
but its base architecture AFAICT isn't
really conducive to threading (or whatever
other technology you want to use to enable
snappy multi-task/buffer work environments).</p>

<p>JEdit is incredibly actively developed.
I would definitely recommend it or else Eclipse (pydev).
Especially the pre-release version of JEdit has much
improved syntax rules, like auto-unindenting for ruby, etc.
There are many plugins for things like project support,
code completion, console access, etc.
One plugin I can't live without is the buffertabs one.
Set the tabs to show open files on top, and it's similar to a lot of
IDEs.
Also, set the gutter preference to show line numbers.</p>

<p>Hi Ian</p>
<p>My comment assumes you don't know Vim - if you do, and you still believe Emacs to be better for you, great(!) and ignore my post.  Otherwise...</p>
<p>Vim is just awesome.  Like someone famous once said, using Vi(m) is practically a zen experience in that the brevity of your keystrokes appears to cancel out brain chatter.  You will already know this as an Emacs user, but for myself, switching from the notepad-like editors of ConTEXT, syn, Zeus and so forth, it was astonishing to me in Vim how low the number of keystrokes for typical routine editing tasks can become.</p>
<p>I don't claim to be a power user in any way, but the features I use often that continually blow my mind are:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>structure-sensitive editing (e.g. the sequence 'daw' deletes a word the cursor is one, while 'dap' deletes a paragraph)</li>
<li>repeats (e.g. to insert a line of comment characters, '80i#&lt;ESC&gt;' inserts 80 of '#' into the current line)</li>
<li>autoformatting and syntax highlighting for many languages (ca. 300, I think)</li>
<li>instant throwaway macro recording (via 'q')</li>
<li>instant search and replace via regexps (e.g. ':%s/^abc/ABC/g' replaces all 'abc's occurring at the start of a line with 'ABC's)</li>
<li>completion using open buffers (CTRL-P)</li>
<li>block selection (CTRL-V)</li>
<li>perfect platform independence</li>
</ul>
<p>I am not an Emacs user, so it is difficult for me to contrast the two for you.  However, for the particular purpose of editing text and writing code, I imagine Vim will be hard to beat in terms of keystroke efficiency, if that is at all important to you.</p>
<p>Vi(m) is of course, not without its faults.  For me, context sensitive completion for python (or any) code /modules is a big deal, because I come from a Delphi background and that feature of the Delphi IDE is incredibly cool.  One day I will put in some effort to build a class inspector into vim.  Since vim is python-scriptable, it shouldn't be that tough.</p>
<p>Good luck!

<dl class="docutils">
<dt>Vim can satisfy ALL of your requirements:</dt>
<dd><ul class="first last simple">
<li>Open Source: Hosted on sourceforge, see vim.org</li>
<li>Python scriptable:  needs to be compiled in.  This is true on default Windows build, not sure about Mac builds</li>
<li>Vim fully supports the single editor instance paradigm.  I find it particularly good on windows when you add the edit with vim explorer extension(part of the default install) which lists the open instances for you to add the file to, or start a new instance.</li>
<li>All the standard features are there (highlighting, many language support, incremental search etc.)</li>
<li>Vim has smart indenting as well as smart reindenting (highlight code and press '=' to indent the selection according to automatic rules)</li>
<li>There are several emacs keybindings plugins</li>
<li>Vim is both gui and console which means that you can ssh into a box and run vim on the remote box.  You can also have vim edit files that it gets over ssh, and ftp.</li>
<li>There is excellent windows support.  I know people who use Vim on Mac, though I don't have Mac so I can't comment on its level of OS integration.</li>
<li>It is actively developed both from the standpoint of the core program(version 7 is in development) and plugins (see vim.org)</li>

<p>SPE is emerging very fast as one of the most promising IDE's. It supports UML, has a gui builder wxGlade and WinPdb a remote debugger, which even can handle multi-threaded programs, etc... Any bugs are quickly fixed and its author is very responsive to its users. If you haven't you should really try out the latest version:

<p>Jed! of course
<a class="reference" href="http://www.jedsoft.org/jed/">http://www.jedsoft.org/jed/</a></p>
<p>I checks on ALL the requirements you mentioned Ian. 
The major difference between Jed and Emacs (cuz you still wanna use emacs keybindings don't you) is that emacs starts in about 3 seconds, jed in 0.1
but jed can't split the screen vertically like emacs can.</p>

<p>I generally use <a class="reference" href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/joe-editor/">joe</a> when I need a quick console editor with Emacs bindings.  I'll give jed a look too, but I only imagine using it as a quick auxillery editor.</p>

<p>I recently moved from ultraedit -&gt; jedit -&gt; wingide. Wingide is completely changed since 1.* and 2.* is really powerful and has everything I need including emacs (and soon to come VI) bindings.</p>
<p>It is also free if you have an open source application (which you do). You should definetly give it a spin</p>

<p>Isn't one of the console-based editor's advantages that the capability is the same whether you are working on your local X-desktop or via ssh to a remote server? ipython appeals to me as an IDE for its console UI and emacs integration. It always is in the back of my mind that if using a powerful GUI IDE or editor, you're probably going to have to do without it at an inopportune moment on some remote machine.</p>
<p>I would love to use a python-based console editor. Emacs intimidates me, but I'm drawn to its power.</p>
<p>IMO, It would be a very good use of PSF grants to support a two-year iniative to develop pure python editors. Year one, a capable editor back-end in pure python is implemented to support most use-cases of power emacs and vi users, and various IDEs. It wouldn't have much of a UI, but its components would be powerful, portable and extensible.</p>
<p>In year two, grants are awarded to teams who propose to write UI layers for the back-end, resembling or inspired by popular editors such as (X)Emacs, Vi(m) and various GUI editors. The point of departure with the imitated famous editors and the new implementations would be a common python scripting and extensibility API from the year-one project. (e.g. Python scripting instead of Emacs LISP and other heresies).</p>
<p>There are most likely limitless possibilities for a well-designed editor back-end in python.</p>
<p>I'd use it.</p>

<p>Leo uses its own file format with funny annotations.  I can't use that, because everyone who worked with my code would need to use Leo as well, and that's no good (at least for me).</p>

<p>I have been searching for a visual editor (basically dragging my widgets across the screen) for wxWidgets.</p>
<p>I found that boa-constructor supports wx, but the problem was that i could not move a widget once it was placed. This is rather discomforting... are there any other rich Visual editors in the market? I would prefer ones for the linux/FreeBSD platforms</p>
