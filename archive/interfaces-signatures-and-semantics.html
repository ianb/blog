                (and latent typing, but mostly the interfaces) -- one of the
                issues with an interface in Python (or this
                <a

                that someone noted in a comment) is that they consist of method
                signatures, but nothing about semantics. This is even more true
                with latent interfaces (where latent interfaces are the
                interfaces you can infer from how code uses an object).
            </p>
            <p>
                The way to make latent interfaces safer in a dynamic environment
                is generally to choose good method names -- you shouldn't use
                the same method name for two conceptually different operations.
                The example in the
                <a
                    class="reference"

                to Bruce's post is a method
                <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">shoot()</span></tt> that
                may refer to a Gun or Camera, where each has very different
                semantic meaning.
            </p>
            <p>
                A more practical example might be
                <tt class="literal"
                    ><span class="pre">obj.write(value)</span></tt
                >
                which might mean <em>write value to obj</em> (i.e., a file-like
                object), or <em>write obj to value</em> (i.e., serialize obj).
                That's a bad choice of method names, because they mean very
                different things, but if you accidentally get an object that
                uses the latter semantics where the first are expected, you
                could get very weird behavior.
            </p>
            <p>
                An explicit interface usually implies specific semantics --
                that's why it's okay to have two interfaces which
                programmatically look the same, i.e., define the same set of
                method names and signatures. Usually an interface also includes
                documentation which provides a description of the semantics.
            </p>
            <p>
                Unfortunately, this doesn't offer any program-accessible
                semantics, only programmer-accessible. We can programmatically
                check signatures, but how can we check semantics? Statically
                typed languages are a little better on this, because their
                signatures include type information which starts to define
                semantic relationships.
            </p>
            <p>
                Anyway, we still have something more general than static typing
                in contracts -- or more concretely, pre- and post-conditions
                (typically a bunch of asserts). After all, what's a type
                declaration besides an assertion of type? (Well, asserted at
                compile-time instead of runtime, but eh)
            </p>
            <p>
                A neat extension to an interface system (like
                <a
                    class="reference"
                    href="http://peak.telecommunity.com/PyProtocols.html"
                    >PyProtocols</a
                >) would be to add contracts. The contracts would be attached to
                the interfaces themselves, not the particular implementation of
                those interfaces.
            </p>
            <p>
                To do this you'd have to change the
                <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">adapt()</span></tt>
                function to return a wrapper -- this wrapper would intercept
                calls that had interface contracts, and confirm the contract as
                well as delegating to the original code. (There might be other
                ways --

            You don't need to add any functionality at all to PyProtocols, all
            of this is already there. It's up to the object, the protocol
            (interface), or some adapter to decide what kind of object gets
            returned (or doesn't). If you want this proxying style, you simply
            make either the objects, the protocols, or adapters return these
            proxies. So the answer is yes, you would have to write code, but no,
            you don't have to change what PyProtocols does.

            Then I guess you'd have to change your... interface objects? Using
            the improved Interface class as the superclass for all your
            interfaces...? Ideally you shouldn't need to make any changes to the
            objects that implement the interfaces in order to support contracts,
            only to the interfaces themselves.

            You don't need to change anything, you just implement some interface
            object that is compliant with PyProtocols (i.e. a subclass of
            Interface) and use that whenever you want its special behavior.
