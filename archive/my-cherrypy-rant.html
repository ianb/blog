                I spent way more time than I planned or wanted to spend on
                CherryPaste today, mostly trying to get Catwalk to work
                correctly.
            </p>
            <p>
                First, CherryPy's WSGI application
                <a class="reference" href="http://www.cherrypy.org/ticket/444"
                    >doesn't use SCRIPT_NAME</a
                >
                like it should. After getting a less than enthusiastic response
                on that ticket, I thought I would just not bother pursuing that
                and fix it myself. CherryPaste could then be seen simply as the
                valid-to-spec WSGI application for CherryPy. That ended up being
                a pain in the butt. The
                <a
                    class="reference"
                    href="http://www.cherrypy.org/wiki/VirtualPathFilter"
                    >VirtualPathFilter</a
                >
                recipe I built off of is just a silly hack, frankly, despite the
                fact that it's a likely part of any realistic deployment. The
                WSGI environment is thrown away, so if you planned to pass
                information through WSGI into the CherryPy request you can't. I
                haven't looked very hard, but I haven't yet found the way to
                turn off CherryPy's catching of exceptions (which I want because
                Paste has a better exception handler). CherryPy eats exceptions
                from some filter methods.
            </p>
            <p>
                This all to get Catwalk to run under something besides the root
                path. Then I realize CatWalk has entirely hardcoded URLs. That's
                just silly.
                <tt class="docutils literal"
                    ><span class="pre">turbogears.view.stdvars</span></tt
                >
                creates dynamic values that it should be using; that was an easy
                enough change. Except TurboGears bases those values off
                something calculated at server startup, and stores it in a
                module global. So I have to patch in a threadlocal value that
                poses as a string. Lastly Catwalk patches the configuration to
                add static paths when you access the index page; but since I'm
                keeping configuration information isolated to each request that
                doesn't work. So I have to add a specific hack to the Catwalk
                entry point to fix up the configuration on each request.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the end it all works, at least for this one case. But damn.
                This is not what I want to be working on. I feel like I'm just
                cleaning up other people's shit. I have enough shit of my own
                that needs cleaning up.
            </p>
            <p>
                It's not like this is Paste-specific stuff.
                <em>No one</em> knows how to do this stuff in CherryPy. No one
                seems to have any authoritative answer on how you deploy these
                apps -- how you move between servers, how you change the
                application root, how you put apps together into a single
                server. Everything is ad hoc stuff that just barely works for
                one app on one server. It's all &quot;recipes&quot;. Recipes are
                often just stuff that no one cares enough about to do right.
                This is too central to what CherryPy is supposed to be doing to
                be a recipe.
            </p>
            <p>
                It occurs to me that TurboGears was extracted from an
                application that runs on the local machine. In that case none of
                these issues would have been apparent. But that's not similar to
                how people are actually using TG. I think these shaky
                underpinnings are risky for the project.

                    Catwalk does all sorts of bad things, like bare except
                    clauses... The style is also very sloppy and inconsistent
                    with PEP-8. It definitely isn't worth my time to fix,
                    though, especially because it's not technically broken.
                    Hopefully the developer will fix those bad habits with more
                    practice.

                        Yeah, there's a number of things. But these are all
                        mostly easy bugs. The template was... well, very
                        peculiar that it hadn't been fixed. But certainly not
                        <em>hard</em> to fix. Doing it right actually was hard,
                        but that wasn't Catwalk's fault.

                        Doh, I saw that, but I was setting the environment
                        (instead of the configuration) to have
                        server.throw_errors (which doesn't do anything). So
                        CherryPaste should handle that now, and Paste exceptions
                        should be usable around a CherryPy app.

                    This is a common problem with cherrypy. there is now easy

                    Surely the big jaw-opener for CherryPy (or was it
                    TurboGears?) was that barely-reported security hole that
                    came up the other day. Less time on the hype and more on the
