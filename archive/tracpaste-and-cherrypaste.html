        <div class="document">
            <p>
                As a kind of first-experiment both in appropriating another
                package and in poking Paste (and setuptools) conventions into a
                package, I have
                <a class="reference" href="http://www.edgewall.com/trac/"
                    >Trac</a
                >
                now working with Paste, both the WSGI side (using their WSGI
                branch) and the installation. It works like this:
            </p>
            <pre class="literal-block">
easy_install 'PasteScript[Cheetah]==dev' 'PasteDeploy==dev' 'Paste&gt;=0.4.1'
paster make-config TracPaste mypackage
# You can edit mypackage/conf/trac.ini now
paster setup-app mypackage/conf/trac.ini
paster serve mypackage/conf/trac.ini
</pre
            >
            <p>
                And that's all you need to setup a project. Now, you might say
                that this is not really much easier than Trac is normally.
                Except, of course, you now can run it with Paste. You are
                probably not impressed.
            </p>
            <p>
                But it does use a clever easy_install hack. TracPaste is in the
                <a
                    class="reference"
                    href="http://cheeseshop.python.org/pypi/TracPaste"
                    >Cheese Shop</a
                >, but has no packages yet -- purely svn. The WSGI branch of
                Trac isn't in the Cheese Shop, but I can link to it from the
                TracPaste page, and get easy_install to automatically install it
                by using the requirement
                <tt class="docutils literal"
                    ><span class="pre">Trac==wsgi,==1.0dev</span></tt
                >
                -- the branch itself is labelled 1.0dev, but I put a link to the
                branch with
                <tt class="docutils literal"
                    ><span class="pre">#egg=Trac-wsgi</span></tt
                >
                appended. You have to give <em>both</em> versions because
                easy_install will download based on that link (guessing that
                <tt class="docutils literal"
                    ><span class="pre">==wsgi</span></tt
                >
                will match), but the result installation does not satisfy the
                <tt class="docutils literal"
                    ><span class="pre">==wsgi</span></tt
                >
                requirement since it is marked upstream as
                <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">1.0dev</span></tt
                >.
            </p>
            <p>
                Paste Script also uses two-phase install.
                <tt class="docutils literal"
                    ><span class="pre">trac-admin</span></tt
                >
                uses an interactive installation, where it asks you questions. I
                find this very annoying, because I don't know what questions are
                coming up, and I don't know the answers without doing ^Z a bunch
                of times. This version installs the config file, but doesn't set
                anything up until you call
                <tt class="docutils literal"
                    ><span class="pre">setup-app</span></tt
                >
                (which writes the database and some files). The config file is
                still just a randomly-ordered set of sections (blame
                ConfigParser), but in a better setup it would be a nice config
                file with helpful comments and with commonly-changed things at
                the top.
            </p>
            <p>
                In related news, here's a quick setup for a
                <a class="reference" href="http://checkandshare.com/catwalk/"
                    >Catwalk</a
                >
                SQLObject model browser:
            </p>
            <pre class="literal-block">
easy_install http://svn.cherrypy.org/trunk/
easy_install -f http://turbogears.org/download/ TurboGears==dev CherryPaste
</pre
            >
            <p>
                I don't have a
                <tt class="docutils literal"
                    ><span class="pre">make-config</span></tt
                >
                setup for it, and I'm not sure I'll make one. You just make your
                own config like:
            </p>
            <pre class="literal-block">
[app:main]
use = egg:CherryPaste#catwalk
model = mypackage.mymodel
# If you need to configure a db connection:
database = mysql://...

[server:main]
use = egg:Paste#http
host = 127.0.0.1
port = 8080
</pre
            >
            <p>
                Then do
                <tt class="docutils literal"
                    ><span class="pre">paster</span>
                    <span class="pre">serve</span>
                    <span class="pre">catwalk.ini</span></tt
                >
                and you'll be set. Now you don't have to be using TurboGears to
                use Catwalk -- you can even embed Catwalk into your own
                (WSGI/Paste) application with relative ease, because that
                configuration file just maps (exactly) to this Python:
            </p>
            <pre class="literal-block">
# egg:CherryPaste#catwalk is defined as this import in
# CherryPaste/setup.py:
from cherrypaste.tg import make_catwalk
app = make_catwalk({}, model='mypackage.mymodel',
                   database='mysql://...')
</pre
            >
            <p>
                Being able to do exactly this was actually one of my primary
                motivations for
                <a class="reference" href="http://pythonpaste.org/cherrypaste/"
                    >CherryPaste</a
                >.

                    The ability to be able to use Catwalk inside any WSGI/Paste
                    application should give a practical example to those who at
                    times have wondered why you keep &quot;pushing&quot; the
                    WSGI stack solution. Hopefully more developers will consider
                    making their web components WSGI and Paste deployable. So
                    glad I use WSGI/Paste/SQLObject in my latest web projects,
                    Catwalk will make development even more &quot;cool&quot;.

                    And were do you find the time to do all this excellent
                    stuff? or is Ian Bicking really a team of python bots :-).
                    Keep up the excellent work.

                    You need to specify a development version of SQLObject in
                    your easy_install line too, or it barfs on wsgi_middleware.
