                                    BDD are fine (a change in developer testing
                                    workflow), but the technique they use to try
                                    to reach the desired workflow is totally
                                    bizarre.

                                                The degree of typing in order to
                                                achieve a goal is hardly the
                                                point. Ruby on Rails does a lot
                                                of work for you, but it&#8217;s
                                                all magical and mystical, and
                                                when stuff breaks, it breaks
                                                HARD, and heaven help you in
                                                finding the bug with any ease.
                                                By contrast, us insane, lame-ass
                                                Java folks love being able to
                                                debug with relative ease. So,
                                                what say we just keep down the
                                                ridicule before we actually
                                                understand why some people
                                                prefer certain
                                                languages/environments, and be a
                                                little less
                                                &#8220;fanboy&#8221;-like.

                                                        Just because Java does
                                                        something doesn&#8217;t
                                                        mean it is some sensible
                                                        side-effect of static
                                                        typing. In this case
                                                        there&#8217;s nothing
                                                        more lax about my
                                                        suggestion compared to
                                                        the original test. I
                                                        think Java people have
                                                        become numb to
                                                        boilerplate, and that
                                                        boilerplate takes a lot
                                                        more forms than just
                                                        static typing.

                                                        I guess it may not be
                                                        clear, but the doctest
                                                        code is in Python not
                                                        Ruby. In Python we too
                                                        tend to to take a more
                                                        restrained view on what
                                                        should be alterable.
                                                        Compare the Django
                                                        framework in Python,
                                                        rather than Rails. On
                                                        whether the amount to
                                                        type is relevant then I
                                                        think that the Javaa
                                                        example given
                                                        <i>is</i> verbose, but
                                                        note that I am not
                                                        saying that the least
                                                        number of characters to
                                                        do the job is
                                                        necessarily the best

                                        Why create a REPL for Java, when you can
                                        just use Jython + doctest? :)

                                        Jython with a doctest did occur to me
                                        after I wrote this, but I think
                                        it&#8217;s a useful enough pattern that
                                        you should also be able to do it
                                        natively in any language. Of course Java
                                        programmers <em>should</em> learn Python
                                        ;) &#8212; but even if they don&#8217;t
                                        they still should have
                                        documentation-driven programming
                                        available to them.

                                    <p>
                                        As you correctly state, the example on
                                        the 2 minutes tutorial is a bit verbose.
                                        With a bit more magic you can get rid of
                                        the before method (<code>setup</code>)
                                        also. If you annotate the
                                        <code>stack</code> field as the subject
                                        (the thing you&#8217;re
                                        &#8220;testing&#8221;), the framework
                                        can auto-create it, freeing you from
                                        some more infrastructure.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        There&#8217;s two things going on here,
                                        there&#8217;s the &#8220;test&#8221;
                                        method (the spec) and stuff that needs
                                        to happen before the spec method. By
                                        convention, initialisation of the
                                        subject happens in the before spec
                                        method; in fact, all configuration goes
                                        here. The second thing is that you make
                                        expectations of how you expect your code
                                        to behave, this is what&#8217;s done in
                                        the spec method.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        The idea behind the expectation DSL is
                                        that it should read like how you would
                                        think or say it: &#8220;I expect that
                                        stack.isEmpty() is equalTo true&#8221;.
                                        True, it&#8217;s more typing than the
                                        equivalent
                                        <code>assertTrue(stack.isEmpty())</code
                                        >, but with this assertion style, you
                                        need to translate it in your head. It
                                        gets worse when you use the
                                        <code
                                            >assertEquals(expected,
                                            actual)</code
                                        >
                                        syntax.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        Also, you don&#8217;t type much of this
                                        stuff, an IDE will auto-complete the
                                        matchers (<code>equalTo()</code>, etc.)
                                        based on the type of the thing you pass
                                        into the <code>that()</code> method. So
                                        booleans get <code>equalTo</code>,
                                        <code>notEqualTo</code>, etc., strings
                                        get <code>matchesRegex</code>,
                                        <code>containsString</code>, etc. This
                                        is <strong>really</strong> nice in
                                        practice when you are creating the
                                        expectations.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        Actually, all you need to get this going
                                        is the following:
                                    </p>

                                    <pre><code>class AnEmptyStack {
    @Subject private Stack stack;

    void mustBeEmpty() {
        expect.that(stack.isEmpty()).equalTo(true);
    }
}
</code></pre>

                                    <p>
                                        You then get a nice readable description
                                        of what the class should do: &#8220;An
                                        empty stack must be empty&#8221;:
                                    </p>

                                    <pre><code>AnEmptyStack
- mustBeEmpty
</code></pre>

                                        This is the first time I&#8217;ve ever
                                        heard of BDD. My initial reaction was
                                        &#8220;this is laughably verbose&#8221;,
                                        but I decided to poke around and came
                                        across
                                        <a

                                        , which did a good job of showing me the
                                        rationale behind BDD.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        BDD seems to have three goals: 1)
                                        explain the purpose of TDD in a more
                                        intuitive way, 2) organize tests into
                                        narratives (a technique pioneered by
                                        doctest), and 3) make the
                                        tests/expectations more natural to write
                                        and read.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        I agree that doctests do a better job
                                        with #3. Compare
                                    </p>

                                        On operator readability: I think Python
                                        already strikes a good balance between
                                        English and symbols. I want
                                        <code>a == b</code>, not
                                        <code>a.isEqualTo(b)</code>, and
                                        <code>t in s</code>, not
                                        <code>s.containsString(t)</code>. Most
                                        languages seem to err on the side of too
                                        many symbols.

                                    <p>
                                        Note that in a doctest every statement
                                        is an implicit assertEqual. So simply
                                        for brevity its really helpful in tests.
                                        Especially if you have some kind of
                                        simple wildcard matching on the output
                                        (this is a bit more awkward in
                                        Python&#8217;s doctest than it should
                                        be).
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        What the small examples don&#8217;t
                                        really point out is the balance between
                                        small and large tests. For small tests
                                        &#8212; like the example &#8212; you
                                        just want to do the test. You
                                        don&#8217;t need to enumerate every
                                        detail of what you test for a report. It
                                        should all go in &#8220;test stack-like
                                        operations&#8221;. If you
                                        <em>do</em> care about the details, then
                                        you should read the actual test code.
                                        Detail-oriented people should read
                                        details, and there&#8217;s no detail
                                        like code detail.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        For larger tests about the behavior of a
                                        piece of code some narrative can be
                                        helpful to introduce the purpose for the
                                        test, what the test shows, and maybe
                                        boundary conditions or whatever else
                                        doesn&#8217;t fit into the test code
                                        itself. ItsHardToDoThatInMixedCase.
                                        It&#8217;s easy to do it in a paragraph
                                        of text. In a doctest test moving
                                        between code and commentary on the code
                                        is simple:
                                    </p>

                                    <pre><code>The StackImpl implements all the stack-like stuff:

  &gt;&gt;&gt; stack.isEmpty();
  true
  &gt;&gt;&gt; stack.add(1);
  &gt;&gt;&gt; stack.isEmpty();
  false

So why a new stack implementation?  Because my stack works
on unhashable items:

  &gt;&gt;&gt; obj = new Object();
  &gt;&gt;&gt; obj.hash();
  Traceback:
      ...
  AttributeError: no hash method defined
  &gt;&gt;&gt; stack.add(obj);
  &gt;&gt;&gt; stack.contains(obj);
  true
</code></pre>

                                        Excuse my simplistic version of Java,

                                            The idea behind the expectation DSL
                                            is that it should read like how you
                                            would think or say it: “I expect
                                            that stack.isEmpty() is equalTo
                                            true”

                                        In a kind of minimalistic way, doctest
                                        is a DSL. I find it reads (and writes)
                                        very much like thinking, at least fairly
                                        low-level thinking about tests. I think
                                        high level stuff is just too divorced
                                        from runnable code to be easy to express
                                        in automated tests. At least I
                                        haven&#8217;t seen a successful example
                                        of that.

                                        Of course, unlike BDD a doctest is just
                                        code. == is ==, it&#8217;s not
                                        <code>should.be</code> or whatever
                                        particular words you choose. But
                                        <em>runnable expectations</em>
                                        <strong>are code</strong>. You already
                                        have one language in the mix (whatever
                                        that language might be), why add
                                        another? Because some non-programmer can
                                        read it? I find that highly unlikely.
                                        Formal programs are
                                        <strong>formal</strong>, and that makes
                                        them hard. You can fuzz it up with lots
                                        of garbage words or other

                                        is this descrpition behind the purpose
                                        of BDD: &#8220;It aims to help focus
                                        development on the delivery of
                                        prioritised, verifiable business value
                                        by providing a common vocabulary (also
                                        referred to as a UbiquitousLanguage)
                                        that spans the divide between Business
                                        and Technology.&#8221;
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        Which is to say the point of BDD is that
                                        your test suites can be read, understood
                                        and commented on by your non-technical
                                        clients. It is about focusing on
                                        requirements and functional testing
                                        first. One produces &#8220;executable
                                        requirements&#8221; the other produces
                                        &#8220;executable documentation&#8221;.
                                        Both doc testing and BDD have a focus on
                                        story-driven development, but doc
                                        testing is usually developer stories,
                                        while BDD is requirements stories.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        Doc testing has that wonderful
                                        simplicity that makes it easy for
                                        developers not used to testing to easily
                                        get started writting tests. If I&#8217;m
                                        trying to write better software for a
                                        client or customer, I think BDD would be
                                        a good approach. It&#8217;s probably
                                        also useful if you are doing a thorough
                                        evaluation of software that you want to
                                        deploy as an application. If I&#8217;m
                                        wanting to consume someone else&#8217;s
                                        software as a developer, I&#8217;d much
                                        rather see an interfaces.py and a
                                        interfaces.txt to give me a high-level
                                        overview of the actual interfaces of the
                                        components in a package and a story of
                                        how those interfaces and implementations
                                        are intended to be used.

                                        I must admit to being shamefully unaware
                                        of doctest, it looks interesting, but
                                        still quite low level. I&#8217;m not
                                        sure you could show the results to
                                        business type person, perhaps it&#8217;s
                                        just the examples that make it look this
                                        way though.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        The syntax is also not quite as readable
                                        (IMO) as the equivalent BDD code, from
                                        the site, it looks to be more checking
                                        the return values after calling code
                                        than stating things about them. BDD
                                        examples are usually more flexible and
                                        descriptive than this. I think you can
                                        probably do the same thing in doctest as
                                        BDD, however a quick read from the site
                                        doesn&#8217;t show this.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        It&#8217;s not quite true to say that
                                        BDD is just for non-technical clients.
                                        BDD is meant to provide readable
                                        specifications for whoever is the client
                                        of the code, that could be a
                                        non-technical person, or could be you.
                                        If it&#8217;s you as a developer,
                                        you&#8217;d want something that was less
                                        verbose and wordey, but still be
                                        readable.
                                    </p>

                                        Historically, there have been two
                                        &#8220;levels&#8221; for BDD, the story
                                        level for non-technical consumers and
                                        code level for technical consumers.
                                        These boundaries are now blurring, and
                                        frameworks such as RSpec have integrated
                                        these and allow you to use either
                                        depending on what you need at the time.

                                        A doctest is a tool for testing that
                                        lends itself to telling stories. Those
                                        stories can be about the implementation,
                                        but they can also be about
                                        behavior/requirements.

                                        The more I read, the more I think these
                                        <code>should_equal</code> /
                                        <code>isEqualTo</code> methods have
                                        nothing to do with BDD. Symbols are used
                                        for things that come up so frequently
                                        that they are <strong>easier</strong> to
                                        read and write as symbols. Software
                                        isn&#8217;t difficult to understand
                                        because it uses a handful of
                                        funny-looking symbols instead of
                                        English: it&#8217;s difficult because it
                                        is extraordinarily detailed. The

                                        I find it difficult to believe Kevin
                                        Teague&#8217;s point (8.); that Business
                                        types who might find a doctest hard to
                                        read, might find a BDD test easier to
                                        understand.
                                    </p>

                                        Tom Adams (4.) Makes the point that
                                        &#8220;you don’t type much of this
                                        stuff, an IDE will auto-complete the
                                        matchers&#8221;. That point never sits
                                        well with me. If the computer can do
                                        this stuff then we should move towards
                                        not having to see it at all &#8211; its
                                        just noise. I moved from C because I was
                                        wasting too much time chasing pointers,
                                        and along came other languages that
                                        handled that for me.

                                    <p>
                                        I think business people (or domain
                                        experts, or whatever kind of
                                        non-programmer) does best reading things
                                        when the text was written with that
                                        person as an intended reader (though not
                                        necessarily the <em>only</em> intended
                                        reader). These people don&#8217;t
                                        consume code, and that&#8217;s true in a
                                        doctest or a BDD test. In a BDD test
                                        they consume the report output, trusting
                                        that it accurately describes what is
                                        being tested. In a doctest they&#8217;ll
                                        skim over the code blocks and read the
                                        text.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        In BDD, you embed this readable text in
                                        the names of your functions and classes,
                                        and in RSpec there are opportunities to
                                        use strings with arbitrary text (that
                                        look a little like docstrings). In no
                                        case does the computer interpret these
                                        strings, or confirm the programmer
                                        actually lived up to what they said
                                        they&#8217;d do. The only thing really
                                        consumable by non-programmers is the
                                        non-code text. So I see two things that
                                        we are attempting to accomplish: (a)
                                        provide a good space for narrative text
                                        about requirements, and (b) attach that
                                        to testing code so that the programmer
                                        can live up to those specifications,
                                        keep them in sync, and for the
                                        requirements document to be a useful and
                                        functional tool to help the programmer.

                                        non-programmers &#8212; from their
                                        perspective the format is pretty
                                        trivial. I don&#8217;t think BDD systems
                                        like RSpec really are editable by
                                        non-programmers, as the text is embedded
                                        in the syntax of the language (which is
                                        pretty fragile); doctest embeds the code
                                        in the text.

                                        programmer-oriented) approach that is
                                        very close to doctest. I personally
                                        think its infrastructure is too complex
                                        and there&#8217;s too much indirection.
                                        The amount of test data that can
                                        usefully go in a table is fairly low in
                                        my experience. It&#8217;s high enough
                                        that I think it can still be useful, but
                                        not high enough to build an entire test
                                        framework on it. If I was writing
                                        doctests where tabular data was
                                        appropriate, I might just write a table
                                        reader that can be used by the doctest,
                                        driving the test off the data while
                                        keeping the all important code close to
                                        the functional specification as well. In
                                        Python this would unfortunately expose a
                                        flaw in doctest: the framework
                                        doesn&#8217;t expose enough to the
                                        tests. I&#8217;d <em>like</em> to
                                        provide hints about failures and what
                                        table data I was using, but
                                        there&#8217;s no way to do that. But
                                        doctest is old, and it really needs some
                                        more love. I would hope that new
                                        implementations would build in a few
                                        more features.

                                        This has been a really good commentary
                                        so far, you guys have thought about
                                        these problems quite a bit, that&#8217;s
                                        quite refreshing to see, your take is
                                        more mature than mine.

                                        In reply to Paddy3118, I wasn&#8217;t
                                        intending to imply by my IDE remark that
                                        the code becomes noise. One of the
                                        things Instinct (not BDD per se) aims to
                                        get rid of is noisy infrastructure. The
                                        point I was trying to make was that it
                                        is more verbose, but by using tools, the
                                        verboseness doesn&#8217;t add any extra
                                        cost in creation, and the benefits you
                                        get from the readability are worth it
                                        regardless (of whether it&#8217;s harder
                                        or easier to create).
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        In fact the Instinct expectation API is
                                        type-safe, making it easier to write
                                        these more verbose statements (the IDE
                                        leads you to the correct methods via the
                                        type) than their less verbose
                                        equivalents.

                                        As always, there&#8217;s a tradeoff
                                        between verboseness and terseness. BDD
                                        aims at producing spec code that is
                                        readable, and in an argument between
                                        readability and terseness I&#8217;d take
                                        readability every time.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        I don&#8217;t believe the Instinct
                                        expectation API is just noise,
                                        it&#8217;s been specifically crafted to
                                        minimise noise (in the eyes of its
                                        developers admittedly). The API aims at
                                        readability and accurately reflecting
                                        the <strong>intent</strong> of the
                                        author. So for example there are several
                                        ways to say a
                                        collection/list/array/string has a
                                        certain length, you pick the one that
                                        most accurately reflects your intent.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        Picking on doctest again, the example
                                        given:
                                    </p>

                                    <pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; len(stack)
0
</code></pre>

                                    <p>
                                        Is not as readable to me as the Instinct
                                        (or RSpec) equivalent. Perhaps
                                        that&#8217;s because I haven&#8217;t
                                        used python for 7 years or so, or
                                        perhaps because I like the ability to
                                        read the expectation aloud and have it
                                        make sense. &#8220;len stack 0&#8243;
                                        doesn&#8217;t read as well to me as
                                        &#8220;expect that stack is of size
                                        0&#8243; or &#8220;stack should be
                                        empty&#8221; (as it would be in RSpec)
                                        though they both assert the same thing.

                                        In the end it comes down to the audience
                                        and how much implicit conversion you do
                                        in your head between what&#8217;s
                                        written and what it means.

                                        Perhaps some of the difference in
                                        opinion is due to the fact that, to a
                                        Python programmer, a console session
                                        feels very natural. That doctest has
                                        existed for a while also means
                                        there&#8217;s lots of examples of it,
                                        adding to the familiarity. It&#8217;s
                                        very difficult, for instance, to read
                                        <code>len(stack)</code> out loud (I
                                        find). Or even worse,
                                        <code
                                            >if obj.get(key, default) ==
                                            value:</code
                                        >
                                        &#8212; how do you read that? &#8220;if
                                        obj [uck, I can't even pronounce 'obj']
                                        get key comma default equals
                                        value&#8221; ? I don&#8217;t know how to
                                        <em>say</em> it, but I can read it very
                                        naturally. It&#8217;s something I (and
                                        everyone here) learned to do. And
                                        that&#8217;s what makes us programmers
                                        ;) In the same way, doctest reads very
                                        naturally to me, even though I
                                        can&#8217;t read it out loud. All these
                                        things require some learning before they
                                        really sink in.

                                        Hi Tom, Ian. I am not so sure that
                                        having the needs of a non-specialist
                                        business manager as a primary goal is a
                                        good thing. Having a concise way to
                                        define tests; concise meaning clear,
                                        comprehensive, <em>and</em> short; from
                                        the domain specialists point of view;
                                        might be more productive.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        I guess as an example I will switch to
                                        the design and verification of digital
                                        chips which is the field I am in. We
                                        have always had a written design spec
                                        that both the verification team and the
                                        design team interpret. lately we are
                                        using assertion languages such as
                                        [PSL](<a
                                            href="http://www.doulos.com/knowhow/psl/"
                                            rel="nofollow"
                                            >http://www.doulos.com/knowhow/psl/</a
                                        >) to accurately and unambiguously
                                        define what the spec. says.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        The spec may say: &#8220;Signal
                                        apply_power occurs after the breaks are
                                        released&#8221;.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        Which in PSL becomes:
                                        <code
                                            >assert always {rose(apply_power)}
                                            |-&gt; { ! brake_applied };</code
                                        >
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        Which re-interpreted in English becomes
                                        something like: &#8220;Ensure that
                                        whenever the signal apply&#95;power
                                        rises, the signal brake&#95;applied is
                                        not high at that same time&#8221;
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        You can formally check the PSL against
                                        the design. You can simulate the design
                                        and ensure it does not contradict the
                                        assertion. Domain specialists can
                                        accurately reason about the specs
                                        interpretation using PSL. ( And pedants
                                        can flag the spelling mistakes :-)
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        Management has to either learn PSL, get
                                        someone they trust who can explain PSL
                                        to them, monitor the process of creating
                                        and using PSL, or probably do all of the
                                        above to be a good manager. The domain
                                        specialist works together with
                                        management so the process of PSL
                                        creation and monitoring ends up as
                                        accurate reports and graphs of progress
                                        <em>but</em> PSL and other assertion
                                        languages are optimised for the domain .
                                        It needs to be writeable and
                                        maintainable by the domain specialists.
                                    </p>

                                        To get back to programming, I think we
                                        should be going down a similar route;
                                        what is maintainable, precise, and
                                        readable for the programmer creating
                                        tests will create better software, and,
                                        I think, prove easier for the manager in
                                        the long run.

                                    <p>Hi Ian, Paddy3118,</p>

                                    <p>
                                        So the question is, does making the
                                        mental translation between what you
                                        <strong>see</strong> and what you
                                        interpret it as affect your ability to
                                        understand the
                                        <strong>intent</strong> of what is being
                                        expressed? I agree with you, I can do
                                        the translation in my head quickly also
                                        (for the tools I&#8217;m used to working
                                        with), however I find a natural DSL type
                                        syntax to be easier to write (good tool
                                        support) and more readable than the
                                        equivalent. So I get a better process
                                        and a better result.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        Having a non-specialist as a target
                                        audience makes sense for top level
                                        &#8220;is this done&#8221; and
                                        &#8220;does it do what I want&#8221;
                                        type of tests
                                        (acceptance/functional/story tests). I
                                        don&#8217;t think anyone is trying to
                                        dumb things down to a point where
                                        <strong>anyone</strong> can read and
                                        reason about code. We should strive to
                                        make it as simple and clear as possible,
                                        but clearly there will always be
                                        complexity and a barrier to entry. What
                                        we are trying to do is use the same
                                        <strong>language</strong> as what a
                                        non-specialist would use, so that they
                                        can at least get an idea of what
                                        we&#8217;re up to (is it what I asked
                                        for, etc.) as well as helping us to not
                                        have to translate between how we think
                                        of things and how they think of things,
                                        this is a recipe for disaster. If your
                                        code and your &#8220;tests&#8221; all
                                        use the same language as that of the
                                        domain, things become a lot simpler,
                                        leaving you to worry about other things.

                                        I hate to say it, Ian, but this post is
                                        kind of cranky.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        You picked an example spec with the
                                        greatest possible
                                        overhead-to-meaningful-code ratio: 9
                                        lines of setup (much of which, like the
                                        import statements, is forced by Java),
                                        and only 3 lines of an actual spec (one
                                        of which is just an annotation saying
                                        that it is, in fact, a spec, so maybe
                                        that&#8217;s overhead, too).
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        What the framework gives you, like
                                        xUnit, is the ability to do some setup
                                        in the setUp() method, then share it
                                        among some other spec methods (test
                                        methods, in xUnit). It&#8217;s pretty
                                        rare that there&#8217;s only one spec
                                        method.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        And only the code is shared: the actual
                                        instance (or whatever other context you
                                        set up) is different for each spec
                                        method, which helps keep one problem
                                        from kicking up a cloud of spurious
                                        follow-on problems to hide itself.
                                        I&#8217;m not sure how you&#8217;d go
                                        about that in doctest without writing
                                        the equivalent of a setUp() method and
                                        calling it repeatedly.

                                        The motivations for BDD are to get
                                        people to do TDD <em>right</em>. That
                                        means ditching anachronistic
                                        test-related names that date from back
                                        when we thought this stuff was unit
                                        testing. It&#8217;s not: it&#8217;s
                                        design, and we should use words related
                                        to design instead. (If there&#8217;s one
                                        thing XP people agree on, it&#8217;s
                                        that names actually matter.)
                                    </p>

                                        Finally, I think you see a conflict
                                        between doctest and BDD. I don&#8217;t:
                                        doctest is a tool, BDD is an approach,
                                        and you could clearly use doctest to
                                        help you do BDD. (Of course, you could,
                                        instead, use it as after-the-fact unit
                                        tests, functional tests, executable
                                        documentation, and possibly a
                                        dessert/floor wax.)

                                        search Frederick Bicking was born in
                                        Winterburg, a municipality in the
                                        district of Bad Kreuznach in
                                        Rhineland-Palatinate, in western Germany
                                        and came probably first to Philadelphia
                                        and then to East Brandywine Township,
                                        Chester County, Pennsylvania, before the

                                        paper mill, establishing the Bicking
                                        paper dynasty that would last well into
                                        the 19th century. The Continental
                                        Congress allocated funds to purchase
                                        Bicking&#8217;s paper for currency
                                        production. He is mentioned in several

                                        Congress and in the George Washington

                                        1752 at St. Michael&#8217;s &amp; Zion

                                        Java: Rhino.

                                        BDD is just new names for TDD. doctest
                                        is a fine framework for doing BDD. Maybe
                                        Instinct is too, but it kind of suffers
                                        from the method definition overhead;
                                        it&#8217;s less painful in Smalltalk,
                                        where the design of SUnit (that it apes)
                                        comes from. But that&#8217;s
                                        Java&#8217;s fault, not
                                        Instinct&#8217;s.
