                                    on the Python wiki.

                                <p>
                                    Looking through that page I&#8217;m reminded
                                    how many framework options there have been.
                                    And I was further reminded of how few
                                    relevant options there are now. From all
                                    this, there have emerged just a few options:
                                    Django, Pylons, TurboGears, Zope. No offense
                                    to anyone left out of that list &#8212; I
                                    know there&#8217;s some other actively
                                    developed frameworks out there. But frankly
                                    they aren&#8217;t serious choices; they
                                    might be fine internal tools, or interesting
                                    experiments, but they are clearly on a
                                    different tier (and they all have
                                    questionable futures).
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    And now that
                                    <a
                                        class="reference external"

                                    the list looks smaller still.

                                    For a long, long time (longer than most of
                                    those frameworks have existed) people have
                                    complained about the proliferation of web
                                    frameworks in Python. Those of us involved
                                    in developing web frameworks in Python
                                    haven&#8217;t been able to respond all that
                                    well. Complaining doesn&#8217;t magically
                                    lead to solutions, and you can&#8217;t just
                                    will there to be a single Python web
                                    framework. You can work towards that, but
                                    that&#8217;s what we&#8217;ve been
                                    doing&#8230; mostly people don&#8217;t seem
                                    to notice. It&#8217;s just not an easy thing
                                    to work towards; the problem space for a web
                                    framework isn&#8217;t well defined, its end
                                    goal is far more vague than most people
                                    immediately realize, and it involves
                                    <em>consensus</em>, which makes everything
                                    much harder. We said the market would
                                    decide, which is kind of a cop out (the
                                    market decides through the decisions of
                                    developers) but that&#8217;s the best answer
                                    we had.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    But after all this time, it seems clear that
                                    we are getting much closer to that goal. If
                                    you squint <em>really</em> hard, you can
                                    almost imagine we <em>are</em> there. The
                                    <em>total</em> list of frameworks only gets
                                    longer over time &#8212; that&#8217;s how
                                    open source works &#8212; but the list of
                                    <em>choices</em> has become quite compact.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    How we get to the next level is a little
                                    less clear. We&#8217;ve gotten this way
                                    largely through attrition, but that&#8217;s
                                    not going to get us any further. I&#8217;ll
                                    at least assure people that we are
                                    discussing this stuff &#8212; it&#8217;s
                                    slow going, but everyone is interested. And
                                    if anyone actually wants to do some leg work
                                    to move this forward, a lot of the work is
                                    actually technical, not political, so
                                    don&#8217;t be afraid to jump in.

                                        This is exactly why I&#8217;m interested
                                        in making Django&#8217;s
                                        Request/Response compatible with the one
                                        used by Pylons. If we can come up with a
                                        documented standard (ala WSGI) we can
                                        collapse the stack even further.

                                        Although you apologized in advance, I
                                        still think Quixote and web.py are fine
                                        choices, and quite different from others
                                        in their approaches.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>LWN uses Quixote. Reddit uses web.py.</p>

                                        The next step will hopefully be that
                                        these frameworks stabilize. It&#8217;s
                                        frustrating to develop against an
                                        ever-changing framework. At least it was
                                        for me when I developed against
                                        TurboGears 0.x.

                                        I&#8217;m not so sure that the concept
                                        of mega-frameworks like TurboGears or
                                        Pylons helps here. Perhaps a
                                        &#8220;certified&#8221; set of libraries
                                        (like Pylons version x, Routes version
                                        y, Paste version z, etc.) could build
                                        more confidence here.

                                        Yes, thanks for going in and saying,
                                        &#8220;This page has never been very
                                        actively maintained.&#8221; I&#8217;m
                                        sure that the page history contradicts
                                        that assertion satisfactorily. Pointing
                                        people to &#8220;blogs, reoccurring
                                        threads on comp.lang.python&#8221; is
                                        great if they&#8217;re already well
                                        aware of all the different blogs out
                                        there, which ones from Planet Python are
                                        worth reading, how to most effectively
                                        search the newsgroups for advice, and so
                                        on. However, I don&#8217;t think this
                                        applies for a large number of people in
                                        the audience in question, and the whole
                                        point of having resources such as those
                                        on the Wiki is to provide a well-known
                                        reference for everyone, not to wave
                                        people off to a lower density medium
                                        where opinions are formed by people who
                                        have the most to say.

                                    <p>
                                        Sure, everyone wants their favourite
                                        framework listed &#8211; I know that
                                        from experience with maintaining these
                                        guides &#8211; and yet people worry
                                        about newcomers choosing &#8220;minority
                                        software&#8221; (or insert another
                                        euphemism for &#8220;not the software I
                                        endorse&#8221; like saying that they are
                                        not &#8220;serious choices&#8221;,
                                        perhaps). However, you&#8217;ll notice
                                        that there aren&#8217;t hundreds of
                                        frameworks on that page, which would be
                                        the case if the now-tedious jokes about
                                        Web frameworks actually had a
                                        substantial basis in fact, and while
                                        it&#8217;s possible that some listed
                                        frameworks should be dropped due to lack
                                        of heavy project activity, some either
                                        do what they&#8217;re supposed to and
                                        don&#8217;t need continuous
                                        redevelopment (which doesn&#8217;t then
                                        prevent them from being valid choices),
                                        or they re-appear at a later point in
                                        time (eg. Aquarius) and presumably
                                        remain valid choices.
                                    </p>

                                        Meanwhile, I dispute that &#8220;a lot
                                        of the work is actually technical, not
                                        political&#8221;. It can be argued that
                                        the reason why no-one has had any
                                        stamina for standardising Python&#8217;s
                                        Web programming scene is because the
                                        work to do so isn&#8217;t particularly
                                        glamourous (eg. look at what the Java
                                        people have done, take notes), and
                                        because people still get a kick out of
                                        differentiation at the cost of
                                        standardisation, four years or so after
                                        this particular discussion began.

                                    <p>Ian,</p>

                                    <p>
                                        I agree that the Python web application
                                        framework world is shrinking, but there
                                        is also a rather large elephant sitting
                                        in the room. Some Python programmers who
                                        would much rather program in Python are
                                        using ROR and I think this trend is
                                        increasing not decreasing. I have no
                                        answer or solution. Just pointing at the
                                        elephant&#8230;.
                                    </p>

                                        web.py. See, reddit is a large-traffic
                                        site and it is built on web.py and
                                        infogami on top of it. openlibrary.org
                                        is a web.py+infogami combinaiton as
                                        well. Those two and many more are much
                                        more than &#8220;fine internal tools, or
                                        interesting experiments&#8221;.

                                        @Seo and Tzury: You do realize that both
                                        those sites were written by the same
                                        person &#8211; and that Reddit has since
                                        moved away from web.py, right? The new
                                        Reddit beta is just Python, no web.py.
                                        One developer, no matter how popular he
                                        is, using his own framework, does not
                                        make a trend.

                                        Reddit&#8217;s new beta doesn&#8217;t
                                        use web.py. AFAIK its not publicly
                                        released what framework, if any,
                                        replaced it, however its still Python
                                        (and probably uses Mako templates).

                                        <strong>Paul:</strong> The WebFrameworks
                                        page lists frameworks like Crusader,
                                        Cymbeline, PyLucid (which is now written
                                        in Django), JOTWeb2, maki, PyWebLib, and
                                        Spark (and to clarify, many of these are
                                        abandoned or hibernating). It lists a
                                        bunch of really old books. The
                                        popularity section contains only a very
                                        rough estimate of Django and TurboGears.
                                        It&#8217;s a horrible landing place for
                                        people looking to make a decision about
                                        a Python web framework. I was just
                                        trying to be helpful to readers by
                                        warning them about that.

                                    <p>
                                        Also, it&#8217;s my belief that any
                                        framework (or any open source project)
                                        without a champion is dead. A lot of
                                        those frameworks don&#8217;t have
                                        champions anymore. They&#8217;ll still
                                        have users, maybe they still will for a
                                        long time, but without a champion the
                                        framework is not a good <em>choice</em>.

                                            Meanwhile, I dispute that “a lot of
                                            the work is actually technical, not
                                            political”. It can be argued that
                                            the reason why no-one has had any
                                            stamina for standardising Python’s
                                            Web programming scene is because the
                                            work to do so isn’t particularly
                                            glamourous (eg. look at what the
                                            Java people have done, take notes),
                                            and because people still get a kick
                                            out of differentiation at the cost
                                            of standardisation, four years or so
                                            after this particular discussion
                                            began.

                                        The technical work I refer to
                                        isn&#8217;t <em>just</em> work,
                                        it&#8217;s the <em>right</em> work. I
                                        believe there&#8217;s some projects
                                        which, right now, are the
                                        <em>right</em> work. Identifying and
                                        improving the best server deployment
                                        options, for example.

                                        As for differentiation vs.
                                        standardization, you can&#8217;t make
                                        that choice when there isn&#8217;t
                                        something &#8212; even just a strong
                                        convention &#8212; to standardize
                                        against. And as for Java, frankly I
                                        think we&#8217;re beyond the point at
                                        which there&#8217;s much to learn there.
                                        Maybe there&#8217;s still some nuggets
                                        there, but when it comes to Python ideas
                                        taken from Java I am usually left very
                                        disappointed by the result.

                                        <strong>Tzury, Seo:</strong> I was going
                                        to note the same thing John just did
                                        about web.py. Regarding Quixote,
                                        it&#8217;s a fine framework but its
                                        forward momentum is just about nil, and
                                        I don&#8217;t think that bothers the
                                        people using it, and it&#8217;s
                                        perfectly fine that they feel that way
                                        but that doesn&#8217;t make Quixote a
                                        good <em>choice</em>.

                                        We get to the next level by pushing WSGI
                                        even more :)

                                        I don&#8217;t think we&#8217;ll ever
                                        reach the one web framework that rules
                                        them all. But it&#8217;s freaking cool
                                        that you can build your own
                                        web-framework in a number of hours!
                                        That&#8217;s the real power of Python
                                        web-development.

                                        I fell in love with [CherryPy](<a

                                        Pylons (which I struggle to understand
                                        due to my own limitations).

                                        interested in doing web stuff in Python
                                        CherryPy is a fun, and I believe viable,
                                        option!

                                    <p>I&#8217;m agree with amix</p>

                                    <p>
                                        Why focus on framework ? They will be
                                        all out of date or will ask users to
                                        change theirs codes one day&#8230;
                                        It&#8217;s why i use my own framework
                                        since years like many others. It&#8217;s
                                        was not difficult to do and now
                                        it&#8217;s become realy easy !
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        What we need is killer web libraries
                                        around wsgi, and i&#8217;m confident
                                        that WebOb will be one of them. Thanks

                                        &#8220;CherryPy&#8221;) is definatly
                                        worth a consideration. Especially if you
                                        don&#8217;t need/use integrated
                                        templating mechanisms or ORMs like us.
                                        We are using XSLT (pretty understimated
                                        in the Python world) and Firebird
                                        (sharing SQL statement logic with Win32
                                        Delphi clients). CherryPy makes it as
                                        easy as possible to plugin your stuff,
                                        leading you fast to your own specialized
                                        framework. It has an extreme friendly
                                        learning curve but all the enhanced
                                        capabilities you will need later. And
                                        finally it&#8217;s build for speed as
                                        well. Therefore, we love it ;).

                                        Pylons could be a contender but Zope,
                                        Django, and Turbogears are to bloated
                                        for our taste.

                                        I also use CherryPy&#8217;s WSGI server
                                        in all of my projects, which from my
                                        benchmarking is still the fastest WSGI
                                        server (and it&#8217;s HTTP 1.1
                                        compatible).
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        It would be cool if the community
                                        developed on one <em>real good</em> WSGI
                                        server. Currently there are quite some
                                        implementations that are lacking.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        Or why not release a fully implemented
                                        WSGI server with Python? This would
                                        spread WSGI love even more :)

                                        I do agree with amix. Why can&#8217;t we
                                        have one <em>real good</em> WSGI server
                                        and also a library ? CherryPY server,
                                        wsgi library such as amix&#8217;s
                                        werkzeug, ian&#8217;s webob, luke
                                        arno&#8217;s stuff (just to name a few)
                                        can be a good start. Let&#8217;s shape
                                        the future of Python web development
                                        around the library and not the
                                        framework.

                                        Logically, the blog entry is
                                        <em>argumentum ad populum</em>.
                                        Politically, if it is necessary to
                                        resist inroads by rival programming
                                        languages, it is expedient to rally
                                        around major frameworks. However, I
                                        submit that any such major framework
                                        needs to be critically evaluated and
                                        re-engineered as necessary to by
                                        pythonic, then locked down tight.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        Having reviewed the field of frameworks
                                        recently to fulfill my requirements, I
                                        did not like any of the major
                                        frameworks. I felt they were too cludgy
                                        <em>for me</em>. I did not feel like I
                                        was asked to write Python, but some
                                        other language. Granted, this is more
                                        obviously apparent in the GUI world than
                                        WUI, but if it does not feel like Python
                                        I have problems using it (when writing
                                        Python). Looking at some tutorials, I
                                        observed significant shift in the
                                        implementation&#8230;
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        As one other responder mentioned, a fear
                                        of adopting one framework is the
                                        likelihood of its having radical
                                        changes. That&#8217;s why I stopped
                                        using Drupal many years ago. I wrote a
                                        set of modules for one minor revision
                                        that were totally broken for the next.
                                        Having seen similar behavior in at least
                                        one framework, I am wary of adopting
                                        any.
                                    </p>

                                        Yes, it is possible to fork a project,
                                        but popular projects do not lend
                                        themselves to a fork without enough
                                        momentum within its community (e.g. X11
                                        v. XORG).
                                    </p>

                                        While suggesting we all jump on a
                                        bandwagon of conformity, it is
                                        imperative that there also be a call for
                                        stability and pythonic engineering of
                                        the major frameworks.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        I specifically avoided mentioning any
                                        framework because my purpose is not to
                                        defame any framework. My purpose is
                                        stability and language conformity. If
                                        you can promise both, then I might be

                                        &#8220;And as for Java, frankly I think
                                        we’re beyond the point at which there’s
                                        much to learn there.&#8221;
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        I think a lot of frameworks could start
                                        out by learning how the Java
                                        technologies manage to work with
                                        Unicode, given the widespread problems
                                        many Python-based frameworks have had
                                        with Unicode until very recently. I note
                                        that someone in the Django community
                                        eventually stepped up and dealt with the
                                        issue, but it probably still remains in
                                        other frameworks, given the occurrence
                                        of discussion threads on such matters in
                                        various places.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        It&#8217;s not all about momentum, you
                                        know &#8211; sometimes you want pieces
                                        of the stack to be stable, even mature.
                                        The problem has been that everyone has
                                        wanted to show how much they&#8217;re
                                        innovating (which has indeed happened),
                                        but that can lead to egregious and
                                        ubiquitous breakage as the developers
                                        refine their work. You wouldn&#8217;t
                                        want your C library API to mutate every
                                        few weeks or months. Likewise,
                                        it&#8217;s a relief to be able to use
                                        technologies which improve but
                                        don&#8217;t break your code needlessly
                                        as they evolve, get updated or get
                                        fixed. (I don&#8217;t update WebStack
                                        very often at all, or at least not the
                                        central abstractions, but that
                                        doesn&#8217;t mean it doesn&#8217;t work
                                        any more, or that it isn&#8217;t useful
                                        for other components or applications.)

                                    <p>As for the Wiki page&#8230;</p>

                                    <p>
                                        &#8220;It’s a horrible landing place for
                                        people looking to make a decision about
                                        a Python web framework. I was just
                                        trying to be helpful to readers by
                                        warning them about that.&#8221;
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        The dates next to the frameworks give
                                        the discerning reader a good indication
                                        of framework vitality, and I don&#8217;t
                                        even think that this was even my idea.
                                        Nevertheless, the page, which was
                                        previously a mess of links and
                                        opportunistic promotion, got an overhaul
                                        a while back after I got fed up with how
                                        incoherent it had become. Whether it
                                        plays an important role in informing
                                        people or not (or whether it represents
                                        the &#8220;new consensus&#8221; around
                                        Python Web frameworks as you see it),
                                        giving it the brush off is rather unfair
                                        to the people who update it (usually not
                                        me, unless I&#8217;m despamming it or
                                        making superficial edits) as well as the
                                        people who find it useful.

                                        &#8220;given the widespread problems
                                        many Python-based frameworks have had
                                        with Unicode&#8230;[they] probably still
                                        [remain] in other frameworks&#8221;

                                        Not really. Pylons and Turbogears
                                        recommend Genshi or Mako templates which
                                        are both built for Unicode from the
                                        ground up. SQLAlchemy, used by both, can
                                        represent tables in Chinese (not just
                                        the data; the <em>schema</em>).
                                    </p>

                                        There <em>are</em> issues remaining with
                                        unicode, but at this point its primarily
                                        a Python problem (and in some cases, a
                                        database problem, like MySQL which can
                                        present some encoding challenges);
                                        strings are still represented as
                                        bytestrings by default, and converting
                                        into unicode objects can be tricky.
                                        That&#8217;s pretty much where the
                                        confusion comes from.

                                        I dont find this to be true in the Java
                                        world either. A year ago, we were using
                                        Hibernate and Struts. Now we&#8217;re
                                        using JPA and Struts2 (which is an
                                        entirely different product);
                                        Hibernate&#8217;s API has been totally
                                        replaced, and Struts has literally been
                                        chucked wholesale. While we might want
                                        to look at Java for insight on how to
                                        handle things, my observation is that
                                        <em>they</em> have been looking at
                                        <em>us</em> (us being, Ruby and Python)
                                        a <em>lot</em> as of late, working at
                                        making their APIs more friendly, adding
                                        decorator-like &#8220;annotations&#8221;
                                        and iterator syntaxes, copying our ideas
                                        for web controllers, and cutting down on
                                        the XML bloat. I think the
                                        &#8220;stability&#8221;/&#8221;maturity&#8221;
                                        perception on the java side comes down
                                        to the sheer number of developers
                                        working on things over there (and being
                                        paid full time to develop them by big
                                        corporations). Whereas Python projects
                                        are often
                                        volunteer/part-time/not-really-funded
                                        ventures with much smaller userbases.

                                        Zope 3 has been unicode safe from the
                                        start. Since 2002 or thereabouts. I was
                                        somewhat bemused at seeing Django
                                        announce unicode support proudly a few
                                        months ago. They have backwards
                                        compatibility hacks and all, right?
                                        We&#8217;ve have had this, without any
                                        hacks, for half a decade and probably
                                        nobody even knows it. Shows how badly we
                                        market Zope 3 (but this is changing,
                                        with Grok).

                                        &#8220;Not really. Pylons and Turbogears
                                        recommend Genshi or Mako templates which
                                        are both built for Unicode from the
                                        ground up.&#8221;

                                        Nice to see that there&#8217;s a
                                        consensus. It wasn&#8217;t always this
                                        way, I believe.

                                        &#8220;There are issues remaining with
                                        unicode, but at this point its primarily
                                        a Python problem (and in some cases, a
                                        database problem, like MySQL which can
                                        present some encoding challenges);
                                        strings are still represented as
                                        bytestrings by default, and converting
                                        into unicode objects can be
                                        tricky.&#8221;
                                    </p>

                                        Ignoring the database issues, which can
                                        be awkward, the &#8220;tricky&#8221;
                                        part of converting byte sequences (plain
                                        strings) into characters (Unicode) is
                                        hardly a &#8220;Python problem&#8221;
                                        unless that&#8217;s a label for the work
                                        that framework developers don&#8217;t
                                        want to do: it&#8217;s a fundamental
                                        part of interpreting the data. Python
                                        3000 doesn&#8217;t magically solve this
                                        for you because the issues don&#8217;t
                                        go away with Python 2.x. Instead, they
                                        reside in the nature of the data the
                                        framework is busy pumping backward and
                                        forward on your behalf &#8211; precisely
                                        at the point where the framework should
                                        be lending a hand.

                                        I didn&#8217;t bother exposing data as
                                        Unicode in WebStack for some time,
                                        mostly because I used the excuse that it
                                        was but a thin wrapper over other
                                        frameworks, but having full Unicode
                                        support for Java Servlets and &#8220;pot
                                        luck&#8221; for all the CPython stuff
                                        was highly embarrassing &#8211; it would
                                        be like an XML toolkit giving you plain
                                        strings and making you do encoding
                                        conversions manually.

                                        If I wanted to point the finger at a
                                        guilty party on the subject of Unicode,
                                        encodings, and so on, it&#8217;d be the
                                        people who wrote the HTTP
                                        specifications, along with the people
                                        writing the next generation of them who
                                        are probably more inclined to dream up
                                        fancy new form widgets than define
                                        unambiguous behaviour. Nevertheless,
                                        other people have considered such
                                        matters before, and it isn&#8217;t
                                        particularly sensible to just ignore
                                        their work, even if they aren&#8217;t
                                        the &#8220;cool&#8221; people any more.

                                        It&#8217;s interesting that some people
                                        now consider CherryPy &#8220;not a
                                        framework&#8221;. When the angst over
                                        the burgeoning number of frameworks
                                        climaxed in 2005 at the PyWebOff talk in
                                        PyCon 2005, CherryPy was one of the
                                        foremost frameworks. So what happened?
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        TurboGears introduced the concept of
                                        &#8220;megaframework&#8221;, which
                                        Django and Pylons are also competing in.
                                        It looks like this has now become
                                        people&#8217;s concept of a
                                        &#8220;framework&#8221;, and the simpler
                                        frameworks are now&#8230; framework
                                        components?
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        The original definition of a framework
                                        was &#8220;it calls you&#8221; &#8212;
                                        i.e., a container for your application
                                        &#8212; as opposed to a library where is
                                        &#8220;you call it&#8221;. So all these
                                        server/dispatcher thingys are frameworks
                                        under this definition, including small
                                        ones like Paste and web.py.

                                        Quixote is still maintained and in
                                        production sites. Its lack of activity
                                        is due to its stability as well as its
                                        minimalistic philosophy: fewer features
                                        means fewer bugs. The Quixote developers
                                        have chosen not to compete in the
                                        megaframework arena but instead to let
                                        people come to it. It does what its
                                        paying sponsors need, in any case. :)
                                        Future development has been targeted to
                                        Qpy, which has a more extensible
                                        codebase.

                                        I just entered into Python world. I
                                        speak Perl. Once I grab up enough
                                        syntax, I&#8217;ll look at the
                                        framework. Thanks

                                    <p>
                                        Regarding RoR, I&#8217;ve arrived back
                                        at Python from Ruby, finding that they
                                        have a much bigger elephant in their
                                        room, probably several elephants.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        First of all, the only deployment game
                                        in town is currently Mongrel, and the
                                        proposal is that you deploy 5 or so 30
                                        meg Rails processes PER APPLICATION. So
                                        you have a bunch of little clusters
                                        popping up everywhere hogging all the
                                        RAM, and in lieu of a single server,
                                        they propose that this all be managed by
                                        a thing called Capistrano. I simply
                                        can&#8217;t do this.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        I went back to Django after seeing the
                                        simple and familiar Apache prefork
                                        deployment on mod_python. Should be good
                                        enough. RoR/Mongrel is some kind of
                                        bandaid. Who thought of this per-app
                                        clustered architecture, at 30 megs a
                                        pop? Am I seriously willing to deploy
                                        that? Guess I&#8217;ll have to take a
                                        look&#8230;
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        Who knows though&#8230;maybe I&#8217;ll
                                        end up going back. Get to know
                                        Capistrano. Seems to me they&#8217;ve
                                        become as complex as Java. Hey, maybe
                                        I&#8217;ll just go back to Java.

                                        Django is the best framework not only in
                                        the python world. it is the best web
                                        framework ever built. Unlike other
                                        framework it is scalable and is ideal
                                        framework for the agile web development.

                                        It makes the list longer but I am trying
                                        to make a point about usability and
                                        software engineering: 1) you cannot
                                        require your average user to be as
                                        knowledgeble as the developers of the
                                        framework; 2) choose a top-down design,
                                        not a bottom-up one, otherwise your
                                        users will be disappointed by APIs that
                                        change on a weekly basis. With

                                        I have tried to address these two
                                        issues. Remember that our competitors
                                        are not other Python frameworks. Our
                                        competitors are JSP, PHP and perhaps
                                        Ruby on Rails.

                                        I started to use Django a few months ago
                                        and I am very impressed by its ease of
                                        use and performance. I was new to Python
                                        (coming from C#) and was a bit surprised
                                        by then quickly amazed by the simplicity
                                        and power of this language !
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        Concerning Python frameworks, Django is
                                        definitely my favorite ! I just found
                                        the frequency of the release a bit slow.
                                        A good start to evaluate other Python
                                        frameworks :

                                        With regard to RoR&#8217;s elephants,
                                        yeah. It still lacks speed-wise and,
                                        ridiculously, requires multiple
                                        concurrent mongrels if you want any type
                                        of throughput. The hope, however, is
                                        that using fibers, event driven DB
                                        access and Ruby 1.9&#8242;s faster VM
                                        will help it avoid some of those
                                        problems, but&#8230;well&#8230;it
                                        ain&#8217;t yet :) Hopefully sometime.
                                        Now to see if we can get Rails
                                        thread-safe&#8230; Django is indeed
                                        nice. I&#8217;d put it right up there
                                        with RoR, if not above. -R

                                        What about a robust and mature (started
                                        in 2000) Python framework that recently
                                        went public under the LGPL and has had
                                        for years the features that will be very
                                        hard to add to django, like
                                        multi-database support ?

                                        I tried both Django (1.1 Final) and
                                        Web2py (1.74.11) I think both these are
                                        good frameworks. WEb2py is a tag easier
                                        than Django. Great job Missio!

                                        definitively a good framework.
